The sample consisted of 28 children (12 from the intervention group and 16 from the control group) aged between 4.1 and 5.9 years (mean = 4.71 ± 0.54) who were in the fifth and sixth grades of pre-school education in two schools from Lugo, Spain.

It can be difficult to diagnose iNPH as the symptoms may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases including \\u200bcervical spondylotic myelopathy. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a progressive degenerative disease in which compression of the cervical spinal cord causes gait disturbances and imbalance, loss of dexterity and strength in the hands, and, at late stages, urinary dysfunction.\\xa0As with iNPH, increased age is associated with higher incidence and prevalence. Surgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord is the treatment of choice in patients with progressive myelopathy.\\xa0Accordingly, iNPH and cervical myelopathy may both present with progressive gait impairment and incontinence, especially in the elderly. The case presented here demonstrates that both iNPH and cervical myelopathy may present simultaneously and result in gait disturbances and imbalance in some patients. For patients with suspected iNPH and myelopathic findings on examination, it is prudent to obtain a cervical spine MRI to assess for cervical stenosis. Moreover, cervical stenosis can mask the effect of cerebrospinal fluid diversion in patients with comorbid iNPH and cervical myelopathy.

It refers to the capability of securely transferring a grasped\\nobject from the gripper to the robot's environment, i.e. the inverse of\\ngrasping or picking, through dexterous manipulation. The game of Go offers an\\nexample: consider how the player would typically place an initially\\npinch-grasped stone onto the board through the dexterous interaction between\\nthe fingers, the stone, and the board. Likewise, dexterous ungrasping addresses\\nthe necessity of changing the object's configuration relative to the gripper or\\nthe environment in order to securely keep hold of the object. In particular, we\\npresent a planning framework for determining a feasible minimum-cost motion\\npath that completes dexterous ungrasping. Digit asymmetry in a gripper, i.e.\\ndifference in digit lengths, is discovered as the key to feasible and secure\\nungrasping. A set of experiments show the effectiveness of dexterous ungrasping\\nin practical placement tasks.\\n\", 2021, 'Dexterity')\n",

The algorithm uses a\\nsampling-based approach to finding the dexterity distribution in the workspace\\ndiscretized by voxels. The oriental dexterity measured in the region of\\ninterest in the task-space formed a fitness function to be optimized through\\ndifferential evolution. This was implemented in the design of a tendon-driven\\nmanipulator for knee arthroscopy. The results showed a feasible design that\\nachieves significantly better dexterity than a rigid tool.

Perhaps one of the most powerful techniques to learn complex\\nmanipulation strategies is imitation learning. However, collecting and learning\\nfrom demonstrations in dexterous manipulation is quite challenging. The\\ncomplex, high-dimensional action-space involved with multi-finger control often\\nleads to poor sample efficiency of learning-based methods. In this work, we\\npropose 'Dexterous Imitation Made Easy' (DIME) a new imitation learning\\nframework for dexterous manipulation. DIME only requires a single RGB camera to\\nobserve a human operator and teleoperate our robotic hand. Once demonstrations\\nare collected, DIME employs standard imitation learning methods to train\\ndexterous manipulation policies. On both simulation and real robot benchmarks\\nwe demonstrate that DIME can be used to solve complex, in-hand manipulation\\ntasks such as 'flipping', 'spinning', and 'rotating' objects with the Allegro\\nhand.

However, the\\nchallenges arise due to the high-dimensional action space of dexterous hand and\\ncomplex compositional dynamics of the long-horizon tasks. We present Sequential\\nDexterity, a general system based on reinforcement learning (RL) that chains\\nmultiple dexterous policies for achieving long-horizon task goals. The core of\\nthe system is a transition feasibility function that progressively finetunes\\nthe sub-policies for enhancing chaining success rate, while also enables\\nautonomous policy-switching for recovery from failures and bypassing redundant\\nstages. Despite being trained only in simulation with a few task objects, our\\nsystem demonstrates generalization capability to novel object shapes and is\\nable to zero-shot transfer to a real-world robot equipped with a dexterous\\nhand.
