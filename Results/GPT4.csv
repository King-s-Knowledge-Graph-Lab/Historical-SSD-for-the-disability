0,Deafness,"This study is concerned with the mean hearing gain in 50 cases of sudden deafness and 40 cases of Menière's disease treated with different drugs and treated with Papaverin and low molecular weight dextran. The treatment of sudden deafness with Papaverin and low molecular dextran was more effective than different drugs. In cases of Menière's disease the treatment with different drugs was not effective, but Papaverin and low molecular dextran was significantly successful. Finally, it is concluded that treatment according to Spoendlin (1969) with Papaverin and low molecular dextran is superior to different drugs.","In mammals, the cochlear sensory epithelium becomes quiescent early during development. After the first postnatal week, there is no cell replacement or proliferation, and severe damage leads to permanent deafness. Supporting cells' trans-differentiation has been suggested as a way to regenerate cochlear hair cells after damage. However, they are also needed for proper functionality. Cdkn1b (p27","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers to the condition of significant hearing loss. Text A discusses clinical treatments for instances of sudden deafness and sets a medical context for attempting to address or remedy the hearing loss. Text B also focuses on the biologic aspect, particularly the permanence of deafness due to inability of cochlear hair cells to regenerate after damage in mammals, underscoring the condition's onset and permanency from a biological standpoint. In both examples, despite the different focuses — one on treatment and the other on causation and biological limitations — ""deafness"" consistently denotes a significant and typically irreversible impairment of hearing, maintaining a consistent medical and health-related context across both time periods."
1,Deafness,"Congenital internal auditory canal stenosis is a rare cause of sensorineural hearing loss in children. A retrospective analysis including clinical manifestation and radiological findings was made for seven patients who were diagnosed with congenital internal auditory canal stenosis from 1996 to 2002. Chief presenting symptoms were hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, dizziness, and tinnitus. Hearing loss including deafness was found in five cases, vestibular function loss in four cases, and profound functional loss of facial nerve in two cases. In all cases, the diameter of the internal auditory canal was less than 2 mm on high-resolution temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scan. Two cases revealed bilateral internal auditory canal stenosis, and others were unilaterally involved cases. Congenital internal auditory canal stenosis can be an important cause of sensorineural hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and vestibular dysfunction. High resolution temporal bone CT scan and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were important tools for diagnosis.","The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of place of stimulation on cortical auditory evoked potentials in relation to speech performance in cochlear implant listeners. It was designed that cortical responses were recorded for single-electrode bursts at apical, medial and basal portions of the electrode array with varying inter-stimulus intervals ranging from 300 ms to 5 s. Latency and amplitude of N1 and P2 peaks were analysed in relation to monosyllabic word scores. The study sample was 44 adult cochlear implant users ranging in age from 28 to 86 years. N1, P2 and N1-P2 amplitudes declined significantly from apical to basal electrodes. The most robust and pronounced responses were recorded for slower stimulation rates (5 s). Speech recognition correlated positively with N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes at the medial electrode. P2 latency showed a significant negative correlation with speech performance at the apical electrode. At last, cortical responses varied significantly depending on the stimulation site and rate. We can objectively quantify speech performance with the N1, N1-P2 amplitude and P2 latency in cochlear implant users. Deafness-related neural degeneration persists even after the cochlear implantation and is more distinct at the base than the apex of the cochlea.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The usage and context of the target word ""deafness"" in both Text A and Text B relate directly to its core meaning, which is the loss of hearing. In Text A, deafness is discussed as a symptom associated with congenital internal auditory canal stenosis, emphasizing it as part of a complex auditory condition typically involving sensorineural hearing loss. Similarly, in Text B, the focus on deafness involves evaluating auditory responses in cochlear implant users, which are again directly related to hearing impairment and its treatment. Thus, despite the advances in medical technology and diagnostic approaches reflected between the texts, the fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as a hearing disorder remains consistent over time, suggesting that there is no significant semantic drift."
2,Deafness,"A 28-year-old woman with inoperable gastric carcinoma was given continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) for 4 weeks while receiving intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH). Eleven days after her last treatment, she developed acute diplopia, deafness and gait ataxia, followed by severe confusion. She became markedly acidotic and hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg, necessitating intubation, dopamine treatment and hemodialysis for 7 h. She was also given thiamine. Thereafter, her blood pressure stabilized, the acidosis improved, and her deafness, diplopia, and confusion were resolved. This case suggests that FP (5-FU/CDDP) therapy toxicity, manifested as acute metabolic acidosis and Wernicke's encephalopathy, may be associated with IVH and thiamine deficiency.","It is well known that the post-natal loss of sensory input in one modality can result in crossmodal reorganization of the deprived cortical areas, but deafness fails to induce crossmodal effects in cat primary auditory cortex (A1). Because the core auditory regions (A1, and anterior auditory field AAF) are arranged as separate, parallel processors, it cannot be assumed that early-deafness affects one in the same manner as the other. The present experiments were conducted to determine if crossmodal effects occur in the anterior auditory field (AAF). Using mature cats (n = 3), ototoxically deafened postnatally, single-unit recordings were made in the gyral and sulcal portions of the AAF. In contrast to the auditory responsivity found in the hearing controls, none of the neurons in early-deafened AAF were activated by auditory stimulation. Instead, the majority (78%) were activated by somatosensory cues, while fewer were driven by visual stimulation (44%; values include unisensory and bimodal neurons). Somatosensory responses could be activated from all locations on the body surface but most often occurred on the head, were often bilateral (e.g., occupied portions of both sides of the body), and were primarily excited by low-threshold hair receptors. Visual receptive fields were large, collectively represented the contralateral visual field, and exhibited conventional response properties such as movement direction and velocity preferences. These results indicate that, following post-natal deafness, both somatosensory and visual modalities participate in crossmodal reinnervation of the AAF, consistent with the growing literature that documents deafness-induced crossmodal plasticity outside A1.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""deafness"" is used to describe a temporary loss of hearing as a symptom or complication arising from medical treatments for another condition (gastric carcinoma, in this case). Deafness is depicted as reversible, associated with acute metabolic acidosis and possibly linked to medically induced issues such as toxicity from treatments. Therefore, deafness appears in the context of a medical symptom that is treatable and potentially transient.

In contrast, Text B discusses ""deafness"" within a scientific study on sensory deprivation and neuroplasticity. The term primarily refers to permanent sensory loss, leading to experimental analysis of its effect on brain structure and function, specifically cross-modal reorganization in auditory cortical areas. This use highlights a more permanent, developmental and neuroscientific aspect of deafness, focusing on brain adaptation and the interaction between sensory modalities following the loss of hearing.

Thus, the shift from a temporary medical symptom context in Text A to a focus on permanent changes in brain function and sensory processing in Text B illustrates that the connotation and implications of ""deafness"" have evolved, reflecting a significant semantic drift over the discussed periods."
3,Deafness,"To evaluate the health care utilization of a nationally representative sample of U.S. deaf adults while accounting for the age at onset of deafness, an indicator of linguistic and sociocultural group affiliation.","Although 62 years have elapsed since the first report of hereditary deafness in a mouse strain, the molecular mechanism of hair cell mechanotransduction remains elusive. Three recent studies present crucial insights into the molecular crux of hair cell mechanotransduction machinery.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
  The usage and context of the word ""deafness"" in Text A and Text B indicate a significant semantic drift. In Text A, ""deafness"" is used primarily with a sociocultural and healthcare perspective, focusing on the implications for deaf adults in terms of healthcare utilization and their community and identity aspects, particularly how they navigate society and access services. There is a significant emphasis on the condition as an aspect of identity and belonging to a linguistic or sociocultural group.

  On the other hand, Text B utilizes ""deafness"" in a strictly biological and genetic context, reflecting advancements in the scientific understanding of the physiological basis of the condition, particularly focusing on the mechanotransduction in hair cells, a critical component of hearing. This perspective is heavily rooted in genetic research and molecular biology, viewing deafness through the lens of mechanistic processes and potential areas for medical intervention.

  This shift from a socio-health-centric view to a detailed genetic and molecular perspective indicates a significant change in the connotations and discussions surrounding ""deafness,"" suggesting a broader, more multifaceted understanding of the term over time."
4,Deafness,"People with deep prelingual deafness cannot fluently use oral language as a basic mode of communication. Hearing impaired subjects elaborated their own mode of communication. Cochlear implants as a surgical mode of deafness treatment may create a new chance for prelingually deaf children to develop vocal speech. The aim of this study was to assess changes in interpersonal mode of communication in pre- and perilingually deaf children after cochlear implantation. It was observed, that cochlear implantation stimulates development of oral language. The possibility of hearing perception of oral language it is a chance for a child for fully participation in life of hearing societies.","Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common congenital infection and the leading acquired cause of developmental disabilities and sensorineural deafness, yet a reliable assessment of the infection burden is lacking.","### Answer:
- Target word: Deafness
- Text A: Discusses deafness as a condition that affects communication, focusing on solutions like cochlear implants to improve speech and auditory capabilities in prelingually deaf children.
- Text B: Identifies deafness as a clinical outcome of congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection, emphasizing its role as a leading cause of sensorineural deafness related to developmental disabilities.
- Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
Both texts, despite discussing different aspects of 'deafness', retain the core meaning of the term as a significant hearing impairment. Text A addresses deafness in the context of communication barriers and improving life through medical interventions like cochlear implants. Text B approaches deafness as a medical condition resulting from infections that can lead to hearing loss. In both instances, 'deafness' consistently refers to the condition of substantial hearing impairment. The use of 'deafness' has not shifted significantly between the two texts, holding a steady clinical and functional implication associated with hearing loss. Thus, the term remains unchanged across different contexts over time."
5,Deafness,"Bacterial meningitis is a common cause of profound deafness and, hence, a common cause of deafness in published series of patients treated with a cochlear prosthesis. Labyrinthitis ossificans is a common finding in meningogenic labyrinthitis and has been considered a relative contraindication to cochlear implantation. In the present study, the numbers of remaining spiral ganglion cells in cases of meningogenic labyrinthitis were correlated with the severity of new bone formation within the inner ear. Six temporal bones in which profound sensorineural hearing loss occurred in life secondary to meningogenic labyrinthitis were studied by serial section light microscopy. Some degree of labyrinthitis ossificans was found in four of six. There was a moderately strong negative correlation between the number of years of total deafness and the percentage of normal of the remaining spiral ganglion cell count. There was a strong negative correlation between the degree of bony occlusion by labyrinthitis ossificans and the normality of the spiral ganglion cell count. The percentage of bony occlusion of the membranous labyrinth increased with the years of total deafness. The significance of these findings for cochlear implantation of individuals with meningogenic labyrinthitis is discussed.","At a time when deaf education teacher preparation programs are declining in number, little is known about their actual effectiveness. A phenomenological case study of a graduate-level comprehensive deaf education teacher preparation program at a midwestern university explored empowered and enabled learning of teacher candidates using the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education educator pillars: (a) commitment to the profession, (b) proficiency in practice, and (c) learning impact, all deemed critical to developing quality teachers. A strong connection was found between the program's comprehensive philosophy and its practice. Embracing diversity of d/Deafness and differentiated instruction were the most prevalent themes expressed by participants. Teacher candidates displayed outstanding commitment to the profession and high proficiency in practice. The findings suggest that additional consideration should be given to classroom and behavior management, teacher candidate workload, teaching beyond academics, and preparation for navigating the public school system.","### Answer:
- Target word: **Deafness**
- Label: **Changed**

### Reason:
In Text A, ""deafness"" is used in a clinical context describing its relation to bacterial meningitis, leading to profound sensorineural hearing loss, with a focus on the pathological changes in the ear (like labyrinthitis ossificans) and their implications for cochlear implantation. The emphasis is on the medical and biological aspects of deafness as a condition primarily defined by its physiological attributes and consequences.

In Text B, ""deafness"" is discussed within the educational and social framework, particularly in the context of deaf education teacher preparation programs. The text emphasizes a comprehensive philosophy towards teaching, recognizing the diversity of deafness (noted by the use of ""d/Deafness"") and the necessity for tailored educational strategies. This presents deafness not only as a medical condition but also as a cultural and communal identity that influences and shapes educational approaches.

The shift from a purely medical condition towards a condition with a significant cultural and educational dimension indicates a semantic drift in the meaning and connotation of the word ""deafness"" from 2000 to 2020."
6,Deafness,"Two-hundred and forty White children attending special schools for the deaf have been investigated by clinical,genetic and laboratory methods in order to determine determine the aetiology of their hearing disability of these, 36% had a genetic basis for their deafness, while in a further 34% an acquired lesion was incriminated. The most important determinants of acquired deafness were maternal rubella, neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia and meningo-encephalitis. The prevention of childhood deafness is primarily dependent upon recognition of the underlying causative factor.","While research has shown that children with single sided deafness have a lower quality of life and developmental outcomes compared to normal hearing peers, little is known about these domains in children with unilateral congenital conductive hearing loss due to aural atresia.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers to the medical condition associated with the loss of hearing. Text A discusses the causes and genetic links to deafness, exploring acquired causes and prevention. Text B focuses on single-sided deafness and its impact on quality of life and development, but it continues to treat ""deafness"" as a hearing-related disability. Although the focus of research and specific contexts vary, the underlying meaning and connotation of ""deafness"" as a condition of impaired hearing remain consistent across both texts."
7,Deafness,"The familial long QT syndrome is a rare condition that may occur with or without deafness. Dextrocardia with complete situs inversus is a familial syndrome generally found in normal subjects with a high incidence of consanguinity among the parents. In this report we describe a Jerbian family with both disorders and with several cases of sudden death. Of 27 members of this family (3 generations) in whom ECG was performed, 15 had QT prolongation (QTc greater than 0.45). Four members (2 generations) had complete situs inversus, 3 of them also had ECG evidence of QT prolongation. The combined occurrence of these rare diseases within the same family has not been previously reported. It may be due to the high incidence of consanguinity and may raise the possibility that the loci responsible for the 2 conditions are closely related and located on the same chromosome. A more extensive study of the family is being carried out.","Genetic causes of hearing loss are highly heterogeneous and often ethnically specific. In recent years, a variety of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels have been developed to target deafness-causative genes. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), on the other hand, was rarely used for genetic testing for deafness. In this study, we performed WES in 38 sporadic Chinese Han deaf patients who have been pre-excluded for mutations in common deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4 and MT-RNR1. Non-synonymous variants have been filtered based on their minor allele frequencies in public databases and ethnically matched controls. Bi-allelic pathogenic mutations in eight deafness genes, OTOF, TRIOBP, ESPN, HARS2, CDH23, MYO7A, USH1C and TJP2, were identified in 10 patients, with 17 mutations identified in this study not being associated with deafness previously. For the rest 28 patients, possibly bi-allelic rare non-synonymous variants in an averaged 4.7 genes per patient were identified as candidate pathogenic causes for future analysis. Our study showed that WES may provide a unified platform for genetic testing of deafness and enables retro-analyzing when new causative genes are revealed.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
  In Text A, the term ""deafness"" is used in the context of a medical condition that occurs alongside other familial syndrome features, without specific emphasis on its genetic roots or detailed investigation into its genetic components. Deafness is mentioned more passively as part of a broader array of conditions affecting a family with high levels of consanguinity.

  In Text B, ""deafness"" is deeply associated with genetic research characterized by next-generation sequencing technologies and specifically noted genetic mutations. It portrays deafness within the context of advanced genetic screening, targeting specific genes known to cause hearing loss, and a more active pursuit of understanding its genetic underpinnings.

  This shift from a general mention of deafness as part of a complex medical condition to a focused and detailed genetic investigation highlights a significant semantic drift. The understanding of deafness has become more nuanced and technologically informed, reflecting a deeper grasp on its genetic causes and a shift towards personalized genetic medicine."
8,Deafness,"In this study, we analysed the clinical and audiological features of 24 vestibular schwannoma patients presenting with sudden deafness who visited our hospital within 10 days after its onset. The relationships between the prognosis of hearing loss and the clinical and audiological features including the pure-tone average (PTA), the presence of dizziness and/or vertigo, the tumour size and the auditory brain stem response (ABR) findings were evaluated. Hearing recovery depended on the PTA and tumour size, but even a small tumour induced sudden deafness. Impaired hearing completely recovered in five our of 24 patients. ABR findings indicated that the aetiology of sudden deafness in the vestibular schwannoma patients might vary in each patient.","A cochlear schwannoma is a rare tumor that arises from the cochlear nerve. Clinically, a cochlear schwannoma mimics the clinical features of sudden deafness or Meniere's disease. We report a case of cochlear schwannoma that presented with sudden hearing loss, which was diagnosed with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and removed using a transotic approach.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" is used specifically to describe a condition characterized by a significant loss of hearing ability. Text A discusses the case of sudden deafness in patients with vestibular schwannoma, focusing on the clinical features and prognosis of hearing loss recovery. Text B reports on a case of cochlear schwannoma that presented with sudden hearing loss, diagnosed and treated surgically. The context in both texts refers to a medical condition involving an abrupt or severe reduction in hearing capability due to specific types of tumors, demonstrating that the usage and connotation of the word ""deafness"" in relation to its medical meaning regarding hearing loss have not changed significantly over time."
9,Deafness,"The clinical electrocochleography essentially allows the registration of the global action potential of the acoustic nerve. The use of acoustic stimulations with alternating polarity eliminates the cochlear microphonics. In severe deafness, where no action potential can be registered, even not with maximal acoustic impulses, it can be interesting to register the microphonic potentials. This can be done by using acoustic stimulations with the same polarity. If some microphonic potentials can be registered by this technique, one can assume that the ciliated cells are -- at least partially -- unaffected and that the cause of the deafmess in neurogenic. This test thus allows a primary differentiation between sensory and neural deafness. Some clinical cases illustrate this phenomenon.","Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26, a component of transmembrane hemichannels which form gap junction channels, critical for cell-cell communication. Here, we report two patients from two distinct families with KID syndrome with the same GJB2 mutation (p.Asp50Asn); in both cases the mutation was de novo, as the parents depicted the wild-type allele only. The patients' cutaneous manifestations were strikingly different illustrating the wide spectrum of phenotype of these patients, even with the same GJB2 mutation. One of the patients was treated with acitretin with dramatic improvement in his skin findings, illustrating the role of oral acitretin in treatment of patients with KID syndrome. Collectively, these patients attest to the phenotypic spectrum of KID syndrome, with therapeutic perspective.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""deafness"" refers to the condition of lacking the ability to hear. In Text A, the term is used to discuss diagnostic practices pertaining to the differentiation between sensory and neural deafness through electrocochleography. It focuses on clinical testing to ascertain the type of deafness. In Text B, deafness is discussed in the context of KID syndrome, attributing it to genetic causes (mutations in the GJB2 gene). Despite the contrasting focuses on diagnosis in Text A (electrocochleographic techniques) and genetic factors in Text B, the inherent meaning of ""deafness"" as a state or condition of being unable to hear remains the same across both texts. The scenarios and details surrounding the term differ, but the central meaning of ""deafness"" as a lack of hearing ability is consistent, thus indicating no semantic drift."
10,Deafness,"We describe a case of the Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, which is a rare disorder characterized by progressive pontobulbar palsy associated with sensorineural deafness. More than 30 cases have been reported since the first case was described in 1894. We review the literature of this condition, comparing our case with those reported in the literature and emphasizing important features to improve our understanding of this syndrome.","Thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) is characterized by a triad of megaloblastic anemia, non-type 1 diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness. Other clinical findings have been described in few cases. The SLC19A2 gene on chromosome 1q 23.3 is implicated in all cases with TRMA. Our aim is to discuss the clinical manifestations of all Omani children diagnosed with TRMA and determine genotype-phenotype relationship.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" specifically refers to ""sensorineural deafness,"" which is a type of hearing loss involving damage to the inner ear or the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain. Both texts describe medical conditions where ""sensorineural deafness"" is a key symptom, and there is no shift in the fundamental meaning of the term ""deafness"" between the two texts, even though they discuss it in the context of different syndromes and diseases. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""deafness"" as a medical condition relating to hearing impairment remains consistent and unchanged across the two different discussions and time periods."
11,Deafness,"Cogan's syndrome is characterized by a non-luetic interstitial keratitis associated with vertigo, tinnitus and profound deafness. Evidence of a systemic vasculitis is found in up to 50% of patients. Atypical forms of Cogan's syndrome have been described in which the ocular inflammatory disease may be more severe. We describe a case of atypical Cogan's syndrome in association with bilateral posterior scleritis. Serial B-scan ultrasound measurements of posterior scleral thickness were found to be useful in assessing disease activity, in combination with clinical findings. Combination therapy with prednisolone and cyclosporin controlled the ocular disease but the deafness was irreversible. The length of follow-up of this case highlights the frequent relapses and difficult management problems which may be faced. This multisystem disease requires the close co-operation of ophthalmologist, physician and otorhinolaryngologist. Aggressive therapeutic intervention with high-dose combined immunosuppressive agents may be necessary to control severe ocular inflammatory disease.","To determine audiological and clinical results of cochlear implantation in children with congenital single sided deafness (SSD), with an emphasis on children implanted before and after 6 years of age.","### Answer:
- Target word: **Deafness**
- Text A: The passage from Text A discusses Cogan's syndrome characterizing it by symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus, and profound deafness along with other complications like systemic vasculitis and ocular disease. The term ""deafness"" here is used in a classical medical sense referring to the irreversible loss of hearing, which is a primary symptom of the discussed disease.
- Text B: Text B focuses on the treatment of deafness using cochlear implantation in children with congenital single-sided deafness (SSD). The term ""deafness"" continues to denote the medical condition of loss of hearing, and the context of its usage emphasizes technological and therapeutic advances to manage and potentially improve the hearing ability in affected individuals.

- Label: **Unchanged**
- Reason: The fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as the medical condition describing the loss of hearing has remained consistent between the two texts, despite the shift in context from describing disease symptoms to discussing treatment options. The word still directly refers to the auditory condition, not deviating in sense or associated implications, showing no significant semantic drift between the two time periods."
12,Deafness,"Two pairs of siblings suffering from recessive hypophosphataemic rickets are presented, three members of which have some degree of sensorineural deafness and all of which have bilateral marked narrowing of the internal auditory canals. The biochemical explanation of the condition is discussed.","Twenty years ago, cochlear implants (CI) were indicated only in cases of profound hearing loss or complete deafness. While from today's perspective the technology was clumsy and provided patients with only limited speech comprehension in quiet scenarios, successive advances in CI technology and the consequent substantial hearing improvements over time have since then resulted in continuous relaxation of indication criteria toward residual hearing. While achievements in implant and processor electronics have been one key factor for the ever-improving hearing performance, development of electro-acoustic CI systems-together with atraumatic implantation concepts-has led to enormous improvements in patients with low-frequency residual hearing. Manufactures have designed special processors with integrated hearing aid components for this patient group, which are capable of conveying acoustic and electric stimulation. A further milestone in improvement of hearing in challenging listening environments was the adoption of signal enhancement algorithms and assistive listening devices from the hearing aid industry. This article gives an overview of the current state of the art in the abovementioned areas of CI technology.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The target word ""deafness"" in Text A refers to the medical condition characterized by significant hearing loss (""sensorineural deafness""). Similarly, in Text B, ""deafness"" also describes a significant loss of hearing to the extent that cochlear implants were originally intended for individuals with profound hearing loss or complete deafness. Both texts utilize the term to denote a severe hearing impairment, aligning closely in the medical and functional implications of the word. There is no significant change in how ""deafness"" is understood or applied between the two contexts over the years, thus confirming that the meaning has remained stable."
13,Deafness,"The audiograms and CT scans of three children with a bilateral congenital mixed deafness are presented. Two children underwent an exploratory tympanotomy revealing a fixed stapes footplate: a perilymph gusher arose during platinotomy in both cases. The gusher was controlled successfully with a large fat graft in both children, and hearing remained unchanged. Two of the children were brothers: they had no other deformities except an enlarged fundus of the auditory canal on CT scans, and no clearly defined bony barrier to the vestibule, suggesting a cerebrospinal fluid fistula. Neither a patent nor an abnormal cochlear aqueduct could be detected in all three cases. It is likely that the three patients present an X-linked mixed deafness syndrome with fixation of the stapedial foot plate and perilymph gusher. A classification of congenital perilymph-CSF shunts is proposed.","The HiFocus Mid-Scala (MS) electrode array has recently been introduced onto the market. This precurved design with a targeted mid-scalar intracochlear position pursues an atraumatic insertion and optimal distance for neural stimulation. In this study we prospectively examined the angular insertion depth achieved and speech perception outcomes resulting from the HiFocus MS electrode array for 6 months after implantation, and retrospectively compared these with the HiFocus 1J lateral wall electrode array. The mean angular insertion depth within the MS population (n = 96) was found at 470°. This was 50° shallower but more consistent than the 1J electrode array (n = 110). Audiological evaluation within a subgroup, including only postlingual, unilaterally implanted, adult cochlear implant recipients who were matched on preoperative speech perception scores and the duration of deafness (MS = 32, 1J = 32), showed no difference in speech perception outcomes between the MS and 1J groups. Furthermore, speech perception outcome was not affected by the angular insertion depth or frequency mismatch.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers primarily to the loss of hearing ability. Text A discusses congenital mixed deafness in children focusing on the specifics of their medical condition and approaches to manage that condition. The context here portrays deafness in terms of diagnostic findings and surgical intervention to manage the hearing impairment described.

  Text B examines a more technological approach to addressing deafness with the introduction of new cochlear implant technology aimed at enhancing hearing capability in individuals with deafness. Although Text B focuses more on the technical aspects of treating deafness through surgical implantation, the fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as a condition involving the significant reduction or loss of hearing ability remains consistent between the two texts.

  Therefore, the semantic meaning and context of ""deafness"" have remained largely unchanged, i.e., it still refers to the auditory condition characterized by impaired hearing, despite advancements in medical procedures and technologies addressing the condition."
14,Deafness,"Approximately 50% of childhood deafness is caused by mutations in specific genes. Autosomal recessive loci account for approximately 80% of nonsyndromic genetic deafness. Here we report the identification of a new transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS3; also known as ECHOS1) expressed in many tissues, including fetal cochlea, which is mutated in the families used to describe both the DFNB10 and DFNB8 loci. An 8-bp deletion and insertion of 18 monomeric (approximately 68-bp) beta-satellite repeat units, normally present in tandem arrays of up to several hundred kilobases on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, causes congenital deafness (DFNB10). A mutation in a splice-acceptor site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion in the mRNA and a frameshift, was detected in childhood onset deafness (DFNB8). This is the first description of beta-satellite insertion into an active gene resulting in a pathogenic state, and the first description of a protease involved in hearing loss.","Tinnitus, the perception of noise in the absence of an external auditory stimulus, is common, frequently distressing and often intractable. It is associated with a number of conditions including deafness but may arise spontaneously. Brain imaging studies indicate increased neuronal excitability and decreased density of benzodiazepine receptors in temporal (auditory) cortex but the source and mechanism of such changes are unknown. Various electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities involving temporal lobe and other brain areas have been described but recordings have been limited to standard EEG wave bands up to frequencies of 22Hz. This clinical study of otherwise healthy patients with intractable unilateral tinnitus, using quantitative EEG power spectral mapping (QEEG), identified discrete localised unilateral foci of high frequency activity in the gamma range (>40-80Hz) over the auditory cortex in eight patients experiencing tinnitus during recording. These high frequency ""hot spots"" were not present in 25 subjects without tinnitus. The results suggest that further EEG investigations should include recordings in the gamma frequency range since such high frequency oscillations are believed to be necessary for perception. Identification of ""hot spots"" in tinnitus patients would provide a means for monitoring the effects of new treatments. These findings may also provide a model for exploration of more complex phenomena such as verbal and musical hallucinations.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" specifically refers to the condition of lacking the ability to hear. Text A discusses deafness in a genetic context, introducing genes and mutations responsible for the condition. Text B discusses deafness as a condition associated with tinnitus, implying some patients experiencing tinnitus also have impaired hearing. Despite the differing focuses - genetic causes in Text A and an associated condition in Text B - the fundamental meaning and definition of ""deafness"" as a loss of hearing ability remain consistent between the two texts. Hence, the word ""deafness"" has not undergone significant semantic drift and retains the same connotation in both contexts."
15,Deafness,"Proximal symphalangism, or Cushing symphalangism (MIM 185800), is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints. Conductive deafness and reduced flexibility of the ankles have also been observed in affected individuals. We have used polymorphic markers throughout the genome to perform genetic linkage analysis in subsequent generations of the family originally described by Harvey Cushing. We have established linkage for this disorder to markers on chromosome 17 (17q21-q22), with Zmax = 6.98 at theta = 0.05 with marker D17S790.","Quality of Life encompasses an individual's well-being and health, social participation and satisfaction with functional daily living. Disabilities such as deafness can impact on the quality of life with spatial variance to the environment. Deafness causes communicative problems with significant consequences in cognitive, social, and emotional well-being of affected individuals. However, information relating to the quality of life of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, especially students in developing countries like Nigeria, which could be used to design special health-related interventions is sparse. This study examined the quality of life of deaf and hard of hearing students in Ibadan metropolis, Nigeria. One hundred and ten deaf and hard of hearing students participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants were drawn from all four secondary schools for the Deaf in Ibadan metropolis. The 26 item Brief version of the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire was used for data collection. The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at statistical significance of p<0.05. Majority (57.8%) of the deaf and hard of hearing students had poor quality of life. Attending the special school for the Deaf, upper socio-economic status and age (≥17years) are significantly associated with better quality of life. However, gender and age at onset of hearing loss had no significant influence on the quality of life. The Deaf community available in the special school appeared to protect against stigma and discrimination, while also promoting social interactions between deaf and hard of hearing individuals.","###Answer:

- **Reason**:
  In **Text A**, the term ""deafness"" is closely linked to a specific medical condition (Conductive deafness) associated with a genetic disorder characterized by physical anomalies (symphalangism). The focus here lies within a narrow, clinical context emphasizing the physiological aspect, specifically the conduction issues in hearing tied to genetic linkages.

  In contrast, **Text B** addresses ""deafness"" within a broader social and psychological context. It emphasizes the impact of deafness on the quality of life, including aspects of social interactions, cognitive and emotional well-being. The usage in Text B is not just about the auditory disability but significantly incorporates the sociocultural and life-impact perspectives, discussing real-world applications in assessing and improving the lives of individuals with hearing impairments.

  Text A and Text B depict a shift from a strictly medical context to a more holistic view that includes the social sciences and quality of life considerations. This denotes a semantic drift in ""deafness"" from a primarily physically descriptive term to a multi-dimensional concept that recognizes its broader impact on an individual's daily life and social integration."
16,Deafness,"Auditory brain-stem responses (ABRs) were studied in 66 subjects with severe head trauma. Middle latency responses (MLRs) were also recorded in 22 of them. Patients were carefully selected to avoid conditions such as pre-existing or acute deafness, hypothermia or ethanol intoxication. In order to evaluate the usefulness of potentials in predicting recovery, patients were classified according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). ABR tracings were classified into 5 groups and MLR into 2 groups. The recovery was good in the presence of a type 1 ABR, poor in the presence of types 3, 4 and 5. Concerning type 2 ABR, the outcome is related to the MLR type, and to the presence of an electrophysiological improvement within the first 3 months following trauma. The reliability of ABR and MLR in predicting the outcome of severe head injury appears to be greater than other usually considered clinical and instrumental data (age, GCS, CT scan, EEG).","PRPS1 codes for the enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase-1 (PRS-1). The spectrum of PRPS1-related disorders associated with reduced activity includes Arts syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 (CMTX5) and X-linked non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2). We describe a novel phenotype associated with decreased PRS-1 function in two affected male siblings. Using whole exome and Sanger sequencing techniques, we identified a novel missense mutation in PRPS1. The clinical phenotype in our patients is characterized by high prenatal maternal α-fetoprotein, intrauterine growth restriction, dysmorphic facial features, severe intellectual disability and spastic quadraparesis. Additional phenotypic features include macular coloboma-like lesions with retinal dystrophy, severe short stature and diabetes insipidus. Exome sequencing of the two affected male siblings identified a shared putative pathogenic mutation c.586C>T p.(Arg196Trp) in the PRPS1 gene that was maternally inherited. Follow-up testing showed normal levels of hypoxanthine in urine samples and uric acid levels in blood serum. The PRS activity was significantly reduced in erythrocytes of the two patients. Nucleotide analysis in erythrocytes revealed abnormally low guanosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate. This presentation is the most severe form of PRPS1-deficiency syndrome described to date and expands the spectrum of PRPS1-related disorders. ","### Answer:

- Reason: 
  In Text A, the use of the term ""deafness"" is primarily in a clinical context related directly to its traditional meaning, which is the loss of hearing. Here, it is mentioned as a condition that was explicitly avoided in patients during a study to ensure the accuracy of auditory brain-stem responses, thus aligning closely with its general medical definition focused on hearing impairment.

  Text B, however, demonstrates an evolution in the understanding and contextual usage of ""deafness,"" where it is associated with a genetic condition (X-linked non-syndromic sensorineural deafness - DFN2) caused by a specific gene (PRPS1), alongside a spectrum of other syndromes and symptoms. This expands the context of ""deafness"" from being simply a condition of hearing loss to being a part of a complex genetic syndrome that includes several other neurological and physical symptoms, thus illustrating a significant shift in the way ""deafness"" is discussed and understood in the medical and genetic research communities.

  This difference highlights a shift from a straightforward medical disability to a more integrated view where ""deafness"" is discussed as part of a broader genetic issue, demonstrating a significant semantic drift in the term's usage over time."
17,Deafness,"A 21 year-old man presented with a history of sudden onset of aphasia and headache. CT showed a left parietal hypodensity and pallidal calcifications. The ECG showed a Wolff-Parkinson-White's syndrome. The patient then developed successively focal epileptic seizures, temper disorders, a cardiomyopathy, a pepper and salt retinopathy with hemeralopia, a left hemiplegia, deafness, and fever of unexplained origin. Left carotid angiography showed thin, irregular or occluded branches of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. Blood muscle enzymes, lactate and pyruvate, were elevated with acidosis. Muscle biopsy revealed a mitochondrial myopathy and blood chemistry showed a severe deficiency of respiratory chain enzymes. Death occurred after 28 months. This case showed the diagnostic features of Melas, with some elements of the Kearns-Sayre syndrome.

Hereditary mutations in KCNE1 have been linked to diseases such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), atrial fibrillation, sudden infant death syndrome, and deafness. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of KCNE1 plays a key role in mediating the physical association with KCNQ1 and in subsequent modulation of channel gating kinetics and conductance. However, the mechanisms associated with these roles for the TMD remain poorly understood, highlighting a need for experimental structural studies. A previous solution NMR study of KCNE1 in LMPG micelles revealed a curved transmembrane domain, a structural feature proposed to be critical to KCNE1 function. However, this curvature potentially reflects an artifact of working in detergent micelles. Double electron electron resonance (DEER) measurements were conducted on KCNE1 in LMPG micelles, POPC/POPG proteoliposomes, and POPC/POPG lipodisq nanoparticles to directly compare the structure of the TMD in a variety of different membrane environments. Experimentally derived DEER distances coupled with simulated annealing molecular dynamic simulations were used to probe the bilayer structure of the TMD of KCNE1. The results indicate that the structure is helical in proteoliposomes and is slightly curved, which is consistent with the previously determined solution NMR structure in micelles. The evident resilience of the curvature in the KCNE1 TMD leads us to hypothesize that the curvature is likely to be maintained upon binding of the protein to the KCNQ1 channel.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the word ""deafness"" refers to a medical condition characterized by the significant loss of hearing. Text A presents it as a symptom occurring in a complex clinical scenario, while Text B describes it as a result of genetic mutations affecting the functionality of specific proteins related to auditory mechanisms. Although the contexts are different—one being clinical symptoms in a broader complex disease and the other focusing on genetic links to deafness—the fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as a hearing impairment remains consistent across both texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of ""deafness"" between the two texts."
18,Deafness,"Autosomal recessive childhood-onset non-syndromic deafness is one of the most frequent forms of inherited hearing impairment. Recently five different chromosomal regions, 7q31, 11q13.5, 13q12, 14q and the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17, have been shown to harbour disease loci for this type of neurosensory deafness. We have studied a large family from Pakistan, containing several consanguineous marriages and segregating for a recessive non-syndromic childhood-onset deafness. Linkage analysis mapped the disease locus (DFNB8) on the distal long arm of chromosome 21, most likely between D21S212 and D21S1225 with the highest lod score of 7.31 at theta = 0.00 for D21S1575 on 21q22.3.","Pathological conditions have been previously documented in the Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos hominins from northern Spain, and several of these have clear behavioral implications. Within this fossil assemblage, Cranium 4 shows bilateral external auditory exostoses which have been preliminarily interpreted as causing a significant hearing loss in this individual. If confirmed, this would be the oldest recorded case of deafness in human history and could have important implications for the antiquity of this condition, as well as social interactions. To further investigate this case, the current study presents 3D reconstructions of the entire outer and middle ear, based on computed tomography scans of both temporal bones in Cranium 4. We established the degree of stenosis in both external auditory canals, showing that in both cases the degree of stenosis is less than 52% of the original cross-sectional area of each canal. Based on clinical studies in living humans, the buildup of wax due to the degree of stenosis in Cranium 4 is unlikely to have caused frequent external ear infections. In addition, we estimated the pattern of sound power transmission up to 5 kHz in both ears relying on a comprehensive model developed in the bioengineering literature and which has been applied previously to the Sima de los Huesos hominins. The model was modified to account for the peculiar shape of the pathological external ear canals in Cranium 4. The results show that this pathology had little to no influence on the sound power transmission in this individual. Thus, we conclude that the exostoses present in both ears of Cranium 4 did not significantly affect their hearing.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In Text A, ""deafness"" refers to a hereditary, non-syndromic condition leading to hearing impairment in childhood. The text discusses genetic factors and loci associated with this type of deafness, describing it purely as a medical and genetic condition affecting hearing ability. In Text B, the term ""deafness"" describes a condition experienced by a historical human fossil, Cranium 4, characterized by external auditory exostoses potentially leading to hearing loss. However, afteranalysis, it concludes that this condition did likely not affect hearing significantly.

In both texts, ""deafness"" maintains its core definition related to the loss of hearing or reduced hearing capability, irrespective of the cause (genetic or pathological). The contexts differ — one modern genetic and the other historical anthropological — yet the underlying reference to hearing impairment as the principal meaning of ""deafness"" remains constant. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the word ""deafness"" between the two periods. Each text employs the term within the scope of discussing hearing impairments, staying true to the essential medical meaning of the word."
19,Deafness,"The authors report a case of a patient presenting with a bronchogenic mediastinal cyst, which presented as a super-infection of the cyst. The cyst was associated with malformation of the cervical vertebra, cardiovascular abnormalities and congenital deafness, placing this in the group of rare complex polymalformation syndrome with Klippel-Feil Syndrome. The authors also stress the value of computed tomography, and above all of nuclear magnetic resonance in the analysis of mediastinal tumours and in particular, of bronchogenic cysts.","Defects in several different connexins have been associated with several different diseases. The most common of these is deafness, where a few mutations in connexin (Cx) 26 have been found to contribute to over 50% of the incidence of non-syndromic deafness in different human populations. Other mutations in Cx26 or Cx30 have also been associated with various skin phenotypes linked to deafness (palmoplanta keratoderma, Bart-Pumphrey syndrome, Vohwinkel syndrome, keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome, etc.). The large array of disease mutants offers unique opportunities to gain insights into the underlying function of gap junction proteins and their channels in the normal and pathogenic physiologies of the cochlea and epidermis. This review focuses on those mutants where the impact on channel function has been assessed, and correlated with the disease phenotype, or organ function in knock-out mouse models. These approaches have provided evidence supporting a role of gap junctions and hemichannels in K(+) removal and recycling in the ear, as well as possible roles for nutrient passage, in the cochlea. In contrast, increases in hemichannel opening leading to increased cell death, were associated with several keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome skin disease/hearing mutants. In addition to providing clues for therapeutic strategies, these findings allow us to better understand the specific functions of connexin channels that are important for normal tissue function.

In Text A, deafness is described as a congenital condition part of a syndrome complex, while in Text B, deafness is discussed in the context of genetic mutations affecting connexins that contribute to this hearing impairment. Despite the different aspects covered (syndromic association in Text A and genetic causes in Text B), the core meaning of ""deafness"" as a hearing impairment condition remains consistent between the texts. Thus, the semantic meaning of the word ""deafness"" has not undergone a significant change."
20,Deafness,"Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by neurosensory deafness and progressive retinitis pigmentosa. So far, three clinical types of Usher syndrome have been defined, and are caused by defects at more than eight loci. We report the linkage analysis of seven Lebanese families with Usher syndrome, two with type I (USH1) and five with type II (USH2). We demonstrate that one family is linked to the USH1C locus, a rare form of USH1 only reported in the French Acadian population. Linkage analysis of the five USH2 families with recently mapped loci allowed us to reduce the USH2A candidate region to a very small interval flanked by D1S2646/D1S2629 and D1S2827. Furthermore, haplotype comparison between the different families suggests a founder effect for the USH2A mutation among the different Lebanese ethnic groups, while a genetic heterogeneity is noted for Usher syndrome type I.","Hearing impairment in adolescents is a major public health problem. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) deafness and hearing impairment are common health problems throughout the world. Hearing impairment generally impairs emotional, social, communication and educational function. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between duration of hearing aid use and improvements in the quality of life. The cross sectional study was conducted at Jalan Peel Primary Special School and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC) from July 2010 until June 2011. A total of 21 students with hearing impairment involved in this study with mean age of 12.57 (10 to 19 years old). The subjects were divided into 2 groups: first-time hearing aid users and long standing hearing aid users. The hearing assessment was conducted in the first group and hearing aids were fitted. After 1 month hearing aid fitting, the questionnaires were distributed to both groups. Statistical analysis had showed no relation (p>0.05) between duration of hearing aid use and the improvement in the quality of life. However, regardless of the duration of hearing aid usage, there was improvement in the quality of life as shown by the scores of the questionnaires. In conclusion there was no significant relation between duration of hearing aid use and the improvement in the quality of life. Hearing aids were beneficial for hearing loss students regardless of the duration of the hearing aid usage. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The examples provided from Text A and Text B both use the target word 'deafness' to denote the same core aspect of auditory impairment or the lack of hearing ability. In Text A, 'deafness' is described as part of the Usher syndrome's symptoms—a genetically inherited condition that causes a progressive loss of hearing among other issues. In Text B, 'deafness' is expressed in the context of understanding hearing impairment in adolescents and analyzing the effects of hearing aids on their quality of life. Both texts, despite being set in very different contexts—one in genetic research and the other in a practical, health study—consistently treat 'deafness' as a medical condition related to hearing loss. There is no evidence of semantic drift in the usage of the word 'deafness' between these two texts, as the basic definition and connotations related to auditory health remain unchanged."
21,Deafness,"An investigation involving 885 children in five institutions for the deaf in Zimbabwe was conducted with a view to determining the cause of hearing loss. The cause of deafness in 40% of cases was an infectious or infective disorder, while in 43% the basic defect was unknown. There was a seemingly high prevalence of autosomal recessively inherited undifferentiated deafness among children from the Shona tribe. Conversely, an apparent underrepresentation of genetic syndromic disorders was evident in both major tribal groups. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.","Single-sided deafness (SSD) and asymmetric hearing loss (AHL) have recently been proposed as a new indication for cochlear implantation. There is still no recommended treatment for these hearing deficits, and most options considered rely on the transfer of sound from the poor ear to the better ear, using Contralateral Routing of the Signal (CROS) hearing aids or bone conduction (BC) devices. In contrast, cochlear implantation allows the poor ear to be stimulated and binaural hearing abilities to be partially restored. Indeed, most recently published studies have reported an improvement in the spatial localisation of an incoming sound and better speech recognition in noisy environments after cochlear implantation in SSD/AHL subjects. It also provides consistent relief of tinnitus when associated. These encouraging hearing outcomes raise the question of the cost-utility of this expensive treatment in an extended indication.","### Label: Changed

### Reason:
In Text A (historical context), the use of the word ""deafness"" primarily refers to the condition of being unable to hear, with an emphasis on the causes of this condition, such as genetic factors or infections. The focus here is on understanding and categorizing the origins and prevalence of hearing loss among different groups. The term is used in a broad, statistical, and epidemiological context, highlighting an effort to analyze and understand hearing loss at a population level.

In Text B, however, the term ""deafness,"" specifically referred to as ""single-sided deafness (SSD)"" and its relative condition ""asymmetric hearing loss (AHL),"" is utilized within the technological and medical treatment advancements sphere, focusing on remediation strategies like cochlear implantation. The usage transcends merely the state of being deaf to the specific interventions aimed at restoring or improving hearing capabilities in affected individuals. The text discusses the functionality enhancements and quality of life improvements afforded by new technologies such as cochlear implants, emphasizing a shift toward solution-driven contexts.

Thus, ""deafness"" has transitioned from being commonly understood and discussed as a condition to be statistically analyzed and categorized (Text A), to a condition requiring and benefiting from advanced medical interventions (Text B). This shift from a descriptive to a more actionable application within medical and technological advances marks a significant semantic drift."

Sensorineural hearing loss is a typical accompanying feature. Previous studies have suggested a prevalence of ~1-1.5 % for MIDD. We studied the molecular epidemiology of MIDD among young (aged 18-45 years) adults in a defined population in southwestern Finland. Of the identified cohort of 1,532 patients with DM, we received blood samples of 299 patients and analyzed them for the m.3243A > G mutation and for mtDNA haplogroups. We found three DM patients (1.0 %) with the m.3243A > G mutation. All the three patients with DM and m.3243A > G also had severe hearing impairment that required use of hearing aid. MtDNA haplogroup U was more prevalent among patients with maternal family history of DM. We conclude that among young adults, ~1 % of all DM is associated with the m.3243A > G mutation. We suggest that all patients with both DM and hearing impairment, at least in this age group, should undergo investigation for this mutation. Furthermore, our results suggest that mtDNA haplogroup U is associated with maternal family history of DM. ","- Label: Unchanged

Similar to Lesch-Nyhan disease, PRPS1-related disorders arise from phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate (PRPP)-dependent nucleotide ""depletion"" of purine nucleotides (e.g., ATP, GTP). S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) appears to partially alleviate purine depletion via a PRPP-independent path. Synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is PRPP dependent, with uridine monophosphate synthase deficiency producing pyrimidine nucleotide depletion. But pyrimidine salvage from uridine does not require PRPP, and this nucleoside is transported freely to pyrimidine-depleted tissues. Regulation of nicotinamide nucleotides is less clear; synthesis from pyridine nucleobases is PRPP dependent. Nucleotide ""depletion"" contrasts with nucleotide ""toxicity,"" exemplified by the purine disorders adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiencies or by pyrimidine nucleotidase deficiency. These are characterized by the accumulation of one or more abnormal nucleotides such as succinyl- or deoxy-nucleotides or their metabolites, which interrupt other nucleotide or related pathways or are toxic to specific cell types. Theoretically, purine toxicity disorders would not be ameliorated by SAMe therapy, and this was confirmed for one adenylosuccinate lyase-deficient child. Nucleotide defects may also be seen as an aspect of mitochondrial disease, with SAMe-based mitochondrial therapy perhaps meriting further investigation.","- Label: Changed

In Text A, ""deafness"" relates primarily to the physical condition of hearing loss and its clinical implications. The context is focused on a specific medical treatment for hearing loss due to a physical anomaly and describes the patient outcomes after surgeries. However, in Text B, ""deafness"" is linked to genetic disorders, specifically highlighting its role within the context of a group of diseases caused by mutations in a specific gene (PRPS1), which also includes various degrees of hearing loss but is primarily explored as a systemic genetic disorder affecting nucleotide metabolism. Thus, the use of ‘deafness’ in Text B distinguishes itself from Text A by pivoting more towards a genetic and biochemical explanation of the condition, encompassing broader systemic implications rather than merely the physical symptom of hearing loss."
26,Deafness,"Mutations in the mitochondrial gene were recently identified in a large pedigree of diabetes mellitus and deafness. As the mitochondrial gene is materially inherited, Japanese diabetic patients whose mothers were also diabetic were screened, using peripheral leucocytes, for an A to G transition at nucleotide pair 3243 of the mitochondrial gene, a tRNA(Leu(UUR)) mutation. This mutation was identified in four pedigrees from among 300 unrelated patients who were screened. Diabetes co-segregated with the mutation, except in one young subject, and was maternally inherited. The apparent onset of disease occurred between 11 and 68 years of age. Some of the affected members developed hearing impairment and congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy, though generally long after the onset of diabetes, and these patients had therefore not been diagnosed as having a specific form of diabetes. The duration of sulphonyl-urea treatment was not more than 8 years in these pedigrees and affected members were prone to progression to insulin-requiring diabetes. Thus, these patients were secondary sulphonylurea failures. Long-term follow-up revealed that the underlying disorder in affected members is a progressive impairment of insulin secretion. Some were initially diagnosed as having IDDM based on an apparent acute onset in youth and the clinical severity of their diabetes. Others were regarded as having MODY with an aggressive course. The mitochondrial gene mutation or diabetes is not transmitted to all offspring of the affected mothers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in the initial pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the cochlea's response to acoustic overstimulation. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling (ICS) waves, which occur in glia and retinal cells in response to injury to activate cell regulatory pathways, have been proposed as an early event in cochlear injury. Disruption of ICS activity is thought to underlie Connexin 26-associated hearing loss, the most common genetic form of deafness, and downstream sequelae of ICS wave activity, such as MAP kinase pathway activation, have been implicated in noise-induced hearing loss. However, ICS waves have only been observed in neonatal cochlear cultures and are thought to be quiescent after the onset of hearing. In this study, we employ an acute explant model of an adult, hearing cochlea that retains many in vivo physiologic features to investigate Ca2+ changes in response to sound. We find that both slow monotonic changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration as well as discrete ICS waves occur with acoustic overstimulation. The ICS waves share many intrinsic features with their better-described neonatal counterparts, including ATP and gap-junction dependence, and propagation velocity and distance. This identification of ICS wave activity in the adult, hearing cochlea thus confirms and characterizes an important early detection mechanism for cochlear trauma and provides a target for interventions for noise-induced and Connexin 26-associated hearing loss.","- Label: Unchanged

In Text A, ""deafness"" is discussed in the context of a genetic condition associated with a mutation in the mitochondrial gene affecting both diabetes and hearing capacity. In Text B, ""deafness"" is used in relation to genetic and noise-induced hearing losses, with specific mention of mechanisms involved in the injury response of cochlear cells leading to hearing loss.

27,Deafness,"A rubella-specific lymphocyte transformation assay, using cryopreserved mononuclear cells, has been developed and used to evaluate specific responses among 21 children with congenitally acquired rubella (CAR), 25 healthy control children and 10 children with sensorineural deafness of unknown aetiology. Although all 21 children with CAR were seropositive, 12 (57.1%) failed to respond to rubella antigen in the transformation assay. Negative in vitro lymphocyte transformation responses were detected significantly more frequently among congenitally infected children below 3 years of age. Thirteen of the 25 (52%) control children were seropositive; only one of these seropositive children (7.6%) gave a negative transformation response. A negative rubella-specific lymphocyte transformation response in a seropositive child, particularly when aged 3 years or younger, is therefore suggestive of CAR. Four of the 10 children with deafness of unknown aetiology were rubella seropositive but gave negative responses in the transformation assay, suggesting that these children had CAR.

- Text A: This text discusses deafness specifically in the context of congenital rubella syndrome (CAR), where deafness appears as a possible consequence or symptom linked to the condition. The focus is very much on the medical and diagnostic aspects, identifying deafness as part of a broader symptomatology associated with congenital infections.
- Text B: Here, the discussion of deafness expands into the investigation of the relationship between lifestyle factors (smoking) and deafness, as well as the genetic predisposition to hearing loss and deafness. It delves into the interaction between genetics and environmental factors (like smoking) and their combined effects on increasing the risks of developing hearing loss/deafness.

### Reason:
The concept of ""deafness"" in these two texts showcases a significant shift in the perspective and breadth of how deafness is viewed and studied:
- **Text A** predominantly ties deafness to a medical condition as a symptom, particularly focusing on its role within the context of congenital rubella.

This development in the semantic field from a specific cause-related symptom to a broader assessment involving lifestyle and genetics signifies a ""Changed"" semantic drift."
28,Deafness,"Red blood cell deformability (RCD) was measured by a filtration technique in 12 patients with sudden sensorineural deafness. Five patients had reduced deformability, including 3 out of 4 patients with a recent upper respiratory tract infection. This may be an important factor in sudden deafness, more likely as a complicating factor of other disorders rather than as a truly primary aetiology. Factors and diseases which alter RCD are discussed and a possible link between the viral and vascular causes of idiopathic sudden deafness is suggested. While several lines of therapy seem promising there is still no clinically proved method for improving RCD. With the development of an acceptable therapeutic regimen, we feel that the possibility of reduced RCD should be considered and that a deformability test be included in the work-up of patients with a sudden sensorineural hearing loss.",The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combining newborn hearing screening with screening for genetic mutations associated with deafness.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" maintains its core medical meaning related to hearing loss. Text A discusses ""sudden sensorineural deafness"" focusing on a specific type of hearing loss and associated physiological factors, whereas Text B addresses screening newborns for genetic markers associated with ""deafness,"" reinforcing the biological and medical implications of hearing loss. Consequently, although the scope and technological approaches differ between the texts, the underlying understanding and meaning of ""deafness"" concerning hearing impairment remain essentially unchanged."

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" is used to denote a condition involving the loss of hearing. In Text A, it is used to describe a symptom of cholesterol granulomas affecting the middle ear, referred to as ""conductive deafness"", indicating a type of hearing loss caused by a physical blockage or malformation. In Text B, the term is again related to hearing impairment associated with genetic factors and investigated in the context of a genetic study, involving mutations linked to deafness. In both cases, despite different contexts and more specific genetic elaboration in Text B, ""deafness"" retains its fundamental meaning as a hearing impairment or loss."
30,Deafness,"A retrospective study was carried out to show the pattern of chronic suppurative otitis media in Sudanese. Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media were 43% of all patients with ear problem. The majority of patients affected by the disease were between 11-30 years with even distribution. Males were affected more than females. The duration of symptoms varied between 0-20 years but most of the patients had the disease for over six years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas pyocyaneous and B. Proteus were the commonest organism isolated in cultures. The predominant presenting symptoms were otorrhoea followed by deafness. The rate of complications was relatively high. The majority of patients were improved after conservative medical treatment, by repeated aural toilet and the use of the appropriate antibiotic.","An orientation to autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), also known as autism, is provided, and the specific syndrome of autism and deafness is addressed. The two conditions have in common a major problem: communication. Case histories are provided, the development of treatment for autism is discussed, and the separate disorders that make up ASD are defined. Important medical conditions often present in ASD are named, and their roles in treatment and diagnosis are described. Because autism is generally regarded as increasing in prevalence, some say to epidemic proportions, there is an increase in children who are both deaf and autistic. The resulting pressure on day and residential school programs for the Deaf to accept and educate these difficult, multiply disabled children is increasing. The parents of autistic children are a sophisticated, politically active group who are demanding services through legal and legislative means, among others.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" is used to describe a condition of impaired hearing. In Text A from an earlier period, deafness is presented as a symptom of chronic suppurative otitis media, emphasizing its role as a clinical outcome or presentation within the context of ear disease. In Text B, which discusses a more contemporary issue, deafness is again described as a condition affecting communication, this time within the context of autism spectrum disorders. The focus remains on the impairment of hearing and its impact on communication abilities.

Although the discussions in the texts revolve around different primary conditions (otitis media vs. autism and deafness), the meaning of ""deafness"" as a loss of hearing capability remains consistent across both contexts. There is no significant shift in the core meaning or connotation of the word ""deafness"" between the two time periods. Both texts highlight the medical and social implications of impaired hearing, maintaining a similar usage of the term."
31,Deafness,The myosin VII motor protein has recently been found to have a role in cell adhesion. This new function is conserved from amoebae to man and provides an explanation for deafness in Usher syndrome patients.,"Cilia were present in the earliest eukaryotic ancestor and underlie many biological processes ranging from cell motility and propulsion of extracellular fluids to sensory physiology. We investigated the contribution of the touch insensitive larva B (tilB) gene to cilia function in Drosophila melanogaster.

In both cases, 'deafness' retains its fundamental meaning as a hearing impairment caused by genetic or cellular anomalies, showing no significant semantic drift in the context of both texts."
32,Deafness,A family is described showing deafness in three consecutive generations. Hirshchsprung's disease was present in at least two of the affected patients and a history of bowel dysfunction was present in the third. The assocation of the two disorders in this family may be due to a single autosomal dominant gene and in this regard differs from previously reported isolated patients with Hirschsprung's disease and deafness.,"A modifier variant can abrogate the risk of a monogenic disorder. DFNM1 is a locus on chromosome 1 encoding a dominant suppressor of human DFNB26 recessive, profound deafness. Here, we report that DFNB26 is associated with a substitution (p.Gly116Glu) in the pleckstrin homology domain of GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1), an essential scaffold in the MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase/HGF (MET/HGF) pathway. A dominant substitution (p.Arg544Gln) of METTL13, encoding a predicted methyltransferase, is the DFNM1 suppressor of GAB1-associated deafness. In zebrafish, human METTL13 mRNA harboring the modifier allele rescued the GAB1-associated morphant phenotype. In mice, GAB1 and METTL13 colocalized in auditory sensory neurons, and METTL13 coimmunoprecipitated with GAB1 and SPRY2, indicating at least a tripartite complex. Expression of MET-signaling genes in human lymphoblastoid cells of individuals homozygous for p.Gly116Glu GAB1 revealed dysregulation of HGF, MET, SHP2, and SPRY2, all of which have reported variants associated with deafness. However, SPRY2 was not dysregulated in normal-hearing humans homozygous for both the GAB1 DFNB26 deafness variant and the dominant METTL13 deafness suppressor, indicating a plausible mechanism of suppression. Identification of METTL13-based modification of MET signaling offers a potential therapeutic strategy for a wide range of associated hearing disorders. Furthermore, MET signaling is essential for diverse functions in many tissues including the inner ear. Therefore, identification of the modifier of MET signaling is likely to have broad clinical implications.","- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:**
  The target word ""deafness"" in both texts pertains essentially to the same fundamental meaning: the condition of lacking the power of hearing or having impaired hearing ability. In Text A, ""deafness"" is referred to as a hereditary condition affecting several generations which might be linked to another genetic disorder. In Text B, ""deafness"" is again discussed within a scientific and genetic context, detailing a specific genetic mutation related to a profound loss of hearing and potential genetic pathways and interactions affecting this condition. While the level of detail and scientific understanding has advanced, the core meaning of ""deafness"" as a hearing impairment remains consistent between both periods. Thus, the usage of the word shows no significant semantic drift over the years in question, reinforcing the label of “Unchanged”."
33,Deafness,"X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a clinically heterogeneous hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with X-linked transmission. Common clinical manifestations of CMTX, as in other forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), are distal muscle wasting and weakness, hyporeflexia, distal sensory disturbance, and foot deformities. Motor nerve conduction velocity is reduced. In male patients it is often less than 38 m/s in the median nerve (a value often used to distinguish between ""demyelinating"" and ""axonal"" forms of CMT), but in female patients conduction velocity may be faster than this or normal. Mutations in the connexin32 (gap junction protein beta 1 (GJB1)) gene are responsible for the majority of CMTX cases. This report describes six British CMTX families with six novel mutations (four missense, one nonsense, and one frame shift) of the GJB1 gene. Affected members in these six families had typical signs of CMT but in some affected members of three families there was additional central nervous system involvement or deafness in the absence of any other explanation other than CMT.","Cochlear implantation has become the standard procedure for restoring substantial hearing in the profoundly deaf. The excellent performance of most of the CI recipients coupled with the rapid evolution of implant technology lead to a distinct expansion in selection criteria for CI. These changes in candidacy primarily include patients with (1) moderate preoperative speech recognition with hearing aids, (2) significant residual hearing, (3) single-sided deafness, and (4) geriatric patients. Many of these patients' conditions were regarded as a clear contraindication to CI only a few years ago. In this article an overview of the current and new aspects of candidacy for cochlear implantation is provided. ","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""deafness"" is used to describe a clinical symptom that occasionally accompanies the genetically linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), specifically highlighting it as part of a broader set of symptoms potentially linked to mutations in a specific gene. This usage situates deafness as a possible but not central element of a neurological condition. Alternatively, Text B discusses ""deafness"" primarily in relation to cochlear implants, focusing on it as a primary condition to be treated or managed through medical technology. This represents deafness primarily as a condition affecting hearing, suitable for medical intervention to restore auditory function. The shift from being mentioned as one symptom among many associated with a genetic disorder to being the primary focus of medical intervention for auditory restoration showcases a significant semantic drift in the focal use and perception of ""deafness"". Therefore, we see a shift from a multi-symptomatic genetic condition aspect to a treatable auditory condition, underscoring the changes in technological perspectives and treatment approaches over time."
34,Deafness,An aneurysm of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery is reported. Symptoms were a sudden and intermittent hearing loss.

We have generated two induced pluripotent stem cell lines (PCli029-A and PCli031-A) from two patients from the same family both carrying the same heterozygous deletion in PAX3 exon 1 (c.-70_85 + 366del). These cells are pluripotent as they can differentiate into ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. They also can activate the early neural crest marker SNAI2. These cells will be useful for studying the human neural crest-derived pigment cells.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" is used explicitly to describe a state of lacking the ability to hear. In Text A, deafness is attributed to retrolabyrinthine issues resulting from an aneurysm that impacts hearing ability. In Text B, deafness is described as a congenital condition associated with Waardenburg syndrome type 1, indicating a genetic cause for the inability to hear. Although the circumstances and etiological descriptions differ between the texts, the fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as a condition of impaired hearing remains consistent across both contexts. There is no evidence of a significant change in meaning or connotation of the word ""deafness"" between the texts from a clinical or medical perspective."
35,Deafness,"We have employed a direct cDNA selection methodology to isolate transcribed sequences encoded in the human chromosomal interval Xq26 that contains the gene for X-chromosome linked albinism deafness syndrome (ADFN). ADFN had been previously mapped to an 8 centi Morgan region on chromosome Xq26. We have constructed six cDNA libraries specific to six YACs mapping to a 1.5 mb span at the distal boundary of the ADFN locus. The YAC specific libraries were characterized for the presence of unique cDNAs. We have identified 15 transcribed sequences from the selected cDNA libraries. These cDNAs matched to three well characterized sequences corresponding to steroid 5-alpha reductase, ribosomal protein L28, and a short transcript that has been shown to be expressed in human brain cortex. Seven of the cDNAs matched to expressed sequence tags or other sequences of unknown function, and five cDNAs shared no homology with sequences in the public data bases. Each one of these sequences was represented as 3-10 clones in the set that was subjected to sequencing. Further characterization of these transcribed sequences may indicate potential candidates responsible for ADFN. We have discussed the utility of cDNA selection methodology in assembling transcript maps and identifying potential candidates for genetic deafness.","Partial deafness (PD) is a condition in which hearing loss occurs in at least 1 frequency critical to speech understanding. Current options for partial deafness treatment (PDT) rely on preoperative hearing preservation, which, along with the use of different means of acoustic and electric stimulation, enable extending the indications for various assistive hearing devices. Possible solutions include acoustic methods only, the use of hearing aids or middle ear implants, electric complementation, and a combination of electric and acoustic stimulation.","###Label: Changed

###Reason:
In the two texts provided, the term ""deafness"" has shown a significant shift in usage and context, indicating semantic drift over time.

- **Text A** uses ""deafness"" in the context of genetic research, particularly focusing on the identification and characterization of genes responsible for a specific syndrome known as X-chromosome linked albinism deafness syndrome (ADFN). Here, ""deafness"" is discussed primarily as a genetic condition that is part of a broader medical syndrome, and the focus is on the underlying genetic causes and the methodology used for gene identification linked to this kind of deafness.

- **Text B**, on the other hand, discusses ""deafness"" as a condition that can be medically and technologically treated or managed. The focus shifts from genetic causation to therapeutic solutions, specifically mentioning various treatment strategies such as acoustic methods, hearing aids, middle ear implants, and combinations of electric and acoustic stimulation for managing partial deafness. This indicates a broader understanding of ""deafness"" as not just a condition but also its implications on quality of life and the possibilities of intervention.

The semantic drift here is from a purely genetic and pathological focus to a broader clinical and therapeutic scope, showing how perspectives and approaches to ""deafness"" have evolved, incorporating technological advancements and changing societal needs for inclusivity and improved life quality for individuals with hearing impairments."
36,Deafness,"Hereditary deafness has proved to be extremely heterogeneous genetically with more than 40 genes mapped or cloned for non-syndromic dominant deafness and 30 for autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness. In spite of significant advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of hearing loss, identifying the precise genetic cause in an individual remains difficult. Consequently, it is important to exclude syndromic causes of deafness by clinical and special investigation and to use all available phenotypic clues for diagnosis. A clinical approach to the aetiological investigation of individuals with hearing loss is suggested, which includes ophthalmology review, renal ultrasound scan and neuro-imaging of petrous temporal bone. Molecular screening of the GJB2 (Connexin 26) gene should be undertaken in all cases of non-syndromic deafness where the cause cannot be identified, since it is a common cause of recessive hearing impairment, the screening is straightforward, and the phenotype unremarkable. By the same token, mitochondrial inheritance of hearing loss should be considered in all multigeneration families, particularly if there is a history of exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics, since genetic testing of specific mitochondrial genes is technically feasible. Most forms of non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing impairment cause a prelingual hearing loss, which is generally severe to profound and not associated with abnormal radiology. Exceptions to this include DFNB2 (MYO7A), DFNB8/10 (TMPRSS3) and DFNB16 (STRC) where age of onset may sometimes be later on in childhood, DFNB4 (SLC26A4) where there may be dilated vestibular aqueducts and endolymphatic sacs, and DFNB9 (OTOF) where there may also be an associated auditory neuropathy. Unusual phenotypes in autosomal dominant forms of deafness, include low frequency hearing loss in DFNA1 (HDIA1) and DFNA6/14/38 (WFS1), mid-frequency hearing loss in DFNA8/12 (TECTA), DFNA13 (COL11A2) and vestibular symptoms and signs in DFNA9 (COCH) and sometimes in DFNA11 (MYO7A). Continued clinical evaluation of types and course of hearing loss and correlation with genotype is important for the intelligent application of molecular testing in the next few years.","The rat is the most extensively studied model organism and is broadly used in biomedical research. Current rat disease models are selected from existing strains and their number is thereby limited by the degree of naturally occurring variation or spontaneous mutations. We have used ENU mutagenesis to increase genetic variation in laboratory rats and identified a recessive mutant, named tornado, showing aberrant circling behavior, hyperactivity, and stereotypic head shaking. More detailed analysis revealed profound deafness due to disorganization and degeneration of the organ of Corti that already manifests at the onset of hearing. We set up a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based mapping strategy to identify the affected gene, revealing strong linkage to the central region of chromosome 1. Candidate gene resequencing identified a point mutation that introduces a premature stopcodon in Myo7a. Mutations in human MYO7A result in Usher syndrome type 1B, a severe autosomal inherited recessive disease that involves deafness and vestibular dysfunction. Here, we present the first characterized rat model for this disease. In addition, we demonstrate proof of principle for the generation and cloning of human disease models in rat using ENU mutagenesis, providing good perspectives for systematic phenotypic screens in the rat.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" consistently refers to the condition of lacking the ability to hear. Text A discusses various genetic aspects and diagnostics involved in hereditary deafness, while Text B describes a rat model demonstrating deafness due to a specific genetic mutation. Both applications of the word focus on the attribute of hearing loss as a primary definition, indicating that the semantic meaning of ""deafness"" has remained stable across the contexts provided by the two different texts."
37,Deafness,"In a non-comparative multicentre trial 51 patients aged 24 days to 17 years received treatment with intravenous or oral fluconazole for suspected systemic fungal infections. Twenty-seven patients had confirmed infections, 26 being confirmed mycologically and 1 histologically. All isolates were Candida species. Of the 43 clinically assessed patients, 30 were considered cured, 7 improved and 6 experienced failure of therapy. Of 27 patients with confirmed fungal infections, 25 were assessed mycologically and all but one were considered cured. Of the six patients experiencing clinical failure, two had a confirmed infection and only one of these experienced mycological failure. This patient had a primary diagnosis of candidemia with persistence of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. All 51 patients were evaluable for safety. No treatment-related adverse events required termination of treatment. Treatment-related side effects (diarrhea, vomiting, deafness) were reported by three of 51 patients, three patients had laboratory test abnormalities possibly related to fluconazole treatment, including elevation of liver enzyme levels and of the eosinophil count. Results of this study confirm the efficacy and safety of fluconazole in the treatment of pediatric patients with severe fungal infection.","We investigated temporal processing in profoundly deaf individuals by testing their ability to make temporal order judgments (TOJs) for pairs of visual stimuli presented at central or peripheral visual eccentricities. Ten profoundly deaf participants judged which of the two visual stimuli appearing on opposite sides of central fixation was delivered first. Stimuli were presented either symmetrically, at central or peripheral locations, or asymmetrically (i.e. one central and the other peripheral) at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) using the method of constant stimuli. Two groups of hearing controls were also tested in this task: 10 hearing controls auditory-deprived during testing and 12 hearing controls who were not subjected to any deprivation procedure. Temporal order thresholds (i.e. just noticeable differences) and points of subjective simultaneity for the two visual stimuli did not differ between groups. However, faster discrimination responses were systematically observed in the deaf than in either group of hearing controls, especially when the first of the two stimuli appeared at peripheral locations. Contrary to some previous findings, our results show that a life-long auditory deprivation does not alter temporal processing abilities in the millisecond range. In fact, we show that deaf participants obtain similar temporal thresholds to hearing controls, while also responding much faster. This enhanced reactivity is documented here for the first time in the context of a temporal processing task, and we suggest it may constitute a critical aspect of the functional changes occurring as a consequence of profound deafness.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The usage of the word ""deafness"" in both texts primarily refers to the medical/physical condition of lacking the sense of hearing. In Text A, ""deafness"" is listed as one of the side effects possibly related to the treatment with fluconazole, indicating a negative outcome affecting the hearing capability. In Text B, the context of ""deafness"" relates to participants who are profoundly deaf, focusing on the investigation of their sensory processing capabilities compared to hearing individuals. Although the focus of each text is different — one looking at it as a side effect and the other examining cognitive abilities in individuals with this condition — the underlying meaning of ""deafness"" as a state of being without hearing remains consistent across both texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the term over the studied period."
38,Deafness,"A 48 year old woman with ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is described. Gene analysis identified two point mutations in exon 1 of the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) gene, one missense mutation and an upstream initiation codon mutation in the 5'-untranslated region (Kozak sequence). The latter mutation is the first one identified in the translation regulatory region. This mutation decreased the level of alpha-TTP protein expression. The clinical features included uncommon urinary disturbance and deafness and relatively rare retinitis pigmentosa. Supplementary therapy increased her serum vitamin E concentration to the normal range with mild improvement of the deep senses.","A variety of internal and external factors influence speech perception performance following cochlear implantation (CI) in adult deaf patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the speech perception performance during repetition testing according to various factors and to identify the predictive factors associated with postoperative speech perception. The performances on speech perception under audio-only conditions were examined over time in 61 adult patients with CI. Mono- and bi-syllable and sentence repetition testing, using both the Korean version of the Central Institute for the Deaf (K-CID) and the K-Western Aphasia Battery test (K-WAB), were performed preoperatively and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. To elucidate the effect that the etiology of deafness has on postoperative outcome, patients were divided into the following four groups: Prelingual hearing loss (HL) (n = 9), Meningitis (n = 6), Progressive HL (n = 31) and Sudden HL groups (n = 15). Moreover, the duration of HL and deafness was defined as follows: (1) ""age of deafness onset: AoD"", (2) ""number of years between the onset of profound deafness and CI: DoD"" and (3) ""percentage of the patient's life with moderate-to-profound hearing loss before CI: PoL"". DoD and PoL were significantly different between the four groups. Although AoD appeared to be associated with performance on the sentence repetition test before standardizing for education level and age (P = 0.015), there was no association after adjusting for these factors (P = 0.719). Only PoL showed a good correlation with performance on repetition testing after CI after adjusting for AoD and DoD. However, DoD was associated with speech perception performance on the sentence repetition test only. In addition, speech perception performance results in the Progressive and Sudden HL groups were improved over the Prelingual HL and Meningitis groups. The Meningitis group showed the poorest speech perception performance among postlingually deaf adults. Consideration of age, education level, etiology and overall time with hearing loss may be necessary for predicting speech perception outcomes in CI recipients.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" refers to the medical condition characterized by the lack of hearing ability. The usage across both texts remains consistent in this regard:

- In Text A, ""deafness"" is mentioned as one of the clinical features of a patient with vitamin E deficiency. The context highlights it as a symptom related to a broader medical case.

- In Text B, ""deafness"" is integral to the study of cochlear implantation outcomes in patients. The text discusses various aspects of the condition, including its onset, duration, and impact on speech perception performance, but the underlying reference remains the impairment of hearing ability.

Both examples employ the term within medical and clinical contexts to describe the hearing impairment condition, showing no significant shift in meaning or application of the word between the time periods of the texts."
39,Deafness,"Song production in song birds is controlled by an efferent pathway. Appended to this pathway is a ""recursive loop"" that is necessary for song acquisition but not for the production of learned song. Since zebra finches learn their song by imitating external models, we speculated that the importance of the recursive loop for learning might derive from its processing of auditory feedback during song acquisition. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the effects on song in birds deafened early in life and birds with early lesions in either of two nuclei--Area X and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN). These nuclei are part of the recursive loop. The three treatments affected song development differently, as reflected by various parameters of the adult song of these birds. Whereas LMAN lesions resulted in songs with monotonous repetitions of a single note complex, songs of Area X-lesioned birds consisted of rambling series of unusually long and variable notes. Furthermore, whereas song of LMAN lesioned birds stabilized early, song stability as seen in intact birds was never achieved in Area X-lesioned birds. Early deafness also resulted in poorly structured and unstable song. We conclude that Area X and LMAN contribute differently to song acquisition: the song variability that is typical of vocal development persists following early deafness or lesions of Area X but ends abruptly following removal of LMAN. Apparently, LMAN plays a crucial role in fostering the kinds of circuit plasticity necessary for learning.","Following auditory deprivation, the remaining sense of vision has shown selective enhancement in visual cognition, especially in the area of near peripheral vision. Visual acuity is poor in the far periphery and may be an area where sound confers the greatest advantage in hearing persons. Experience with a visuospatial language such as British Sign Language (BSL) makes additional demands on the visual system. To test the different and separable effects of deafness and use of a visuo-spatial language on far peripheral visual processing, we investigated visual reaction times (RTs) and response accuracy to visual stimuli, between 30° and 85° along the four cardinal and four inter-cardinal meridians. We used three luminances of static, briefly illuminated stimuli in visually normal adults. The cohort tested included profoundly congenitally deaf adults (","- Label: Changed
- Reason: The meaning and context of the target word ""deafness"" has seen a notable shift between the two time periods as gauged from Text A and Text B. In Text A, ""deafness"" is explored in an experimental context focused on its direct effect on song learning and production in birds, particularly how auditory deficits influence vocal development and neural plasticity. This represents a biological and behavioral study, specifically analyzing the functional impact of auditory deprivation on an animal's learning capabilities. In contrast, Text B centers around the implications of ""deafness"" for human cognitive and sensory enhancement, particularly how visual senses are adapted and potentially improved in deaf individuals. This text studies the compensatory enhancements in other sensory modalities, reflecting a broader, psychological and perceptual perspective. This drift from a narrow biological and physiological focus to a broader cognitive and compensatory aspect in humans illustrates a significant semantic change in the context and implications of the word ""deafness""."
40,Deafness,"Profound deafness, defined here as a hearing loss in excess of 90 dB, is characterized by high thresholds, reduced hearing range in the intensity and frequency domains, and poor resolution in the frequency and time domains. The high thresholds call for hearing aids with unusually high gains or remote microphones that can be placed close to the signal source. The former option creates acoustic feedback problems for which digital signal processing may yet offer solutions. The latter option calls for carrier wave technology that is already available. The reduced frequency and intensity ranges would appear to call for frequency and/or amplitude compression. It might also be argued, however, that any attempts to compress the acoustic signal into the limited hearing range of the profoundly deaf will be counterproductive because of poor frequency and time resolution, especially when the signal is present in noise. In experiments with a 2-channel compression system, only 1 of 9 subjects showed an improvement of perception with the introduction of fast-release (20 ms) compression. The other 8 experienced no benefit or a slight deterioration of performance. These results support the concept of providing the profoundly deaf with simpler, rather than more complex, patterns, perhaps through the use of feature extraction hearing aids. Data from users of cochlear implants already employing feature extraction techniques also support this concept.","Biallelic mutations in LOXHD1 have been identified as the cause of DFNB77 (deafness, autosomal recessive 77). It is a new progressive, severe-to-profound, and late-onset nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL), and is highly heterogeneous genetically and phenotypically. This study aimed to provide an additional three cases of DFNB77.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" refers to a significant loss of hearing capability. Text A describes the physical and logistical implications of profound deafness, focusing on the challenges faced in enhancing audio perception for those affected. On the other hand, Text B focuses on a genetic condition leading to a form of severe-to-profound, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, but the fundamental concept of ""deafness"" - as a significant hearing impairment - remains constant between the two texts. Neither text introduces a usage of ""deafness"" that deviates substantially from the primary definition related to hearing impairment, indicating no significant semantic drift in the word's meaning over the period between the two texts."
41,Deafness,"The Acute Profound Deafness Investigation and Research Group of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare conducted nation-wide studies on idiopathic sudden deafness, mumps deafness, and deafness accompanied by perilymphatic leak. In the epidemiological study, data were accumulated from 11 institutions on the incidence and prognosis of patients with idiopathic sudden deafness, especially involving total deafness or near-total deafness; mumps deafness; and deafness accompanied by perilymphatic leak. Out of 1,331 patients with sudden deafness, total deafness was found in 8.6% of the patients, and near-total deafness was found in 10.7% of the patients, with prognosis being less favorable in the former than in the latter. Perilymphatic leak was found in 10(0.7%) of the patients with idiopathic sudden deafness. Among the patients with deafness accompanied by perilymphatic leak, hearing recovery was rated as cured or markedly recovered in 41% of the patients. Hearing recovery was not observed in all the patients with mumps deafness showing total deafness.",One option for patients with single sided deafness (SSD) who experience problems with insufficient hearing in different surroundings is the treatment with percutaneous bone-anchored hearing aids.

- Reason: The term ""deafness"" in both Text A and Text B refers to the condition of lacking the ability to hear. In Text A, it discusses various causes and findings related to deafness, including idiopathic sudden deafness and mumps deafness. Text B, while more focused on treatments (specifically bone-anchored and transcutaneous hearing aids for single sided deafness), still uses the word ""deafness"" to denote the lack or loss of hearing. Thus, the fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as a medical condition related to hearing impairment remains the same across both texts, despite differences in the context (epidemiological study vs. clinical treatment). This shows that the term has not undergone significant semantic drift in its core meaning across the years discussed."
42,Deafness,"Deafness mutant mice show no stimulus-related cochlear potentials as well as abnormal electrically-evoked responses recorded from the inferior colliculus. Abnormal spontaneous activity in the auditory periphery could result in abnormal development and/or maintenance of the central auditory pathways. We therefore assessed spontaneous activity of cochlear origin in the central nuclei of the mutants by ablating one cochlea and subsequently using the 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) technique to study metabolic activity. Any asymmetries in labeling in a given nucleus should be due to spontaneous activity in the cochlear nerve on the unoperated side. In control animals (+/dn mice undergoing unilateral cochlea ablation), statistically significant decreased 2DG labeling was observed in the ipsilateral PVCN and AVCN, and contralateral MNTB and IC; all receive primary excitatory input from the ablated ear. No significant differences in labeling between right and left sides were observed in any of the nuclei studied in the mutant animals. These findings suggest that there is no spontaneous activity of cochlear origin in these mutants, even though many cochlear nerve fibers and spiral ganglion cells survive.","To determine the efficacy, benefit, and safety of a new in-the-mouth bone conduction device (SoundBite Hearing System) for single-sided deafness (SSD).","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" is used to describe the state of lacking or being impaired in hearing ability. Text A discusses this in the context of a scientific study on mutant mice and their responses to auditory stimuli, focusing on biological and neurological aspects. Text B discusses the evaluation of a device meant to aid those with single-sided deafness, focusing on its efficacy and safety.

Hence, the semantic drift for the term ""deafness"" is labeled as ""Unchanged""."
43,Deafness,"Tiludronate, a potent bisphosphonate, has been extensively evaluated in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone. Its ability to normalize bone turnover without impairing mineralization suggests that tiludronate represents an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of this progressive and disabling disease. Recent attention has focused on the development of appropriate short- and long-term treatment goals: namely the control of clinical symptoms, such as bone pain, and the reduction of bone turnover to within normal range, to lessen the risk of developing later complications, such as deafness, deformity and walking difficulties. This reduction of bone turnover is the primary aim of treatment. The clinical development of tiludronate has involved large-scale international multicenter trials. To allow the comparison of results obtained in a variety of clinical settings, great emphasis was placed on the use of consistent methodology across the program. This applied to patient selection, trial design, the evaluation of clinically meaningful effects of treatment and statistical analysis of results. Strict adherence to these principles has allowed us to compare the results of treatment with tiludronate in 85 centers in six countries across Europe. This paper illustrates the importance of clinical trial design in the evaluation of tiludronate and etidronate in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone, with a brief summary of results obtained from a recent comparative, prospective, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial. Effective suppression of bone turnover was assessed by monitoring the reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase and the ratio of urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine. Reduction in bone pain was assessed using Huskisson's visual analog scale. The results clearly show that tiludronate 400 mg/day for 3 months is more effective and as equally well tolerated as etidronate 400 mg/day.","This paper presents analysis and design of a radio frequency power and data link for a novel Bone Conduction Implant (BCI) system. Patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss and single-sided deafness can be rehabilitated by bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA). Whereas the conventional hearing aids transmit sound to the tympanic membrane via air conduction, the BAHA transmits sound via vibrations through the skull directly to the cochlea. It uses a titanium screw that penetrates the skin and needs life-long daily care; it may cause skin infection and redness. The BCI is developed as an alternative to the percutaneous BAHA since it leaves the skin intact. The BCI comprises an external audio processor with a transmitter coil and an implanted unit called the bridging bone conductor with a receiver coil. Using amplitude modulation of the Class-E power amplifier that drives the inductive link, the sound signal is transmitted to the implant through the intact skin. It was found that the BCI can generate enough output force level for candidate patients. Maximum power output of the BCI was designed to occur at 5-mm skin thickness and the variability was within 1.5 dB for 1-8-mm skin thickness variations.","- **Label**: Changed

- **Reason**: In Text A, the use of the word ""deafness"" refers to it as a potential complication or symptom stemming from a disease (specifically Paget's disease of bone), where the risk increases with improper management of the disease. The context is purely medical and focuses on reducing the risk of deafness as part of a broader aim of disease treatment and management.

  In Text B, the usage of ""deafness,"" specifically ""single-sided deafness,"" relates to a condition that can be addressed through technological intervention, involving a bone conduction implant (BCI). Here, deafness is not merely seen as a symptom or complication, but rather as a condition that can be potentially improved or mitigated through medical devices. The focus is on rehabilitating individuals experiencing deafness, thus viewing the condition through the lens of potential treatment solutions.

  The semantic drift is evident in how deafness is approached: from a risk to be managed as part of a disease progression in Text A to a condition that can be actively treated and improved using specialized medical devices in Text B. This shift indicates a change in the perception and management of deafness over time."
44,Deafness,"Muckle-Wells syndrome is a hereditary condition with variable penetrance. The main manifestations are urticarial rash, malaise in the evening, joint pain, perception deafness and renal amylosis.","Evaluating risks associated with multiple occupational exposures is no easy task, especially when chemical and physical nuisances are combined. In most countries, public institutions have created databases, which gather extensive information on occupational exposures or work-related diseases. Unfortunately, these tools rarely integrate medical and exposure information, and, above all, do not take into account the possible adverse effects of co-exposures. Therefore, an attempt to exploit and join different existing databases for the assessment of the health effects of multiple exposures is described herein. This case study examines three French databases describing exposures to noise and/or ototoxic chemicals (i.e., toxic to the ear) and the incidence rate of occupational deafness in different sectors. The goals were (1) to highlight occupational sectors where the workers are the most (co)exposed and (2) to determine whether this approach could confirm the experimental data showing that this co-exposure increases the risk of developing hearing loss. The results present data per occupational sector exposing workers to noise only, ototoxic chemicals only, noise and ototoxic chemicals, and neither of these two nuisances. The ten sectors in which the proportion of exposed workers is the highest are listed. This analysis shows that the rate of hearing loss in these sectors is high but does not show an increased incidence of hearing loss in co-exposed sectors.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""deafness"" refers specifically to the loss of hearing. In Text A, ""perception deafness"" is mentioned as a symptom of Muckle-Wells syndrome, indicating a type of hearing loss associated with the disease. In Text B, the usage of ""deafness"" relates to hearing loss resulting from occupational exposures, mainly to noise and ototoxic chemicals. Although the contexts vary—one being medical-genetic and the other occupational health—the core meaning of ""deafness"" as hearing loss remains consistent between the two texts, showing no significant semantic drift."
45,Deafness,"We have studied 36 subjects in a large multigenerational Chinese family that is segregating for an autosomal dominant adult onset form of progressive non-syndromic hearing loss. All affected subjects had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss involving all frequencies with some significant gender differences in initial presentation. After excluding linkage to known loci for non-syndromic deafness, we used the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) to test for 351 polymorphic markers distributed at approximately 10 cM intervals throughout the genome. Analysis of the resulting data provided evidence that the locus designated DFNA41 maps to a 15 cM region on chromosome 12q24.32-qter, proximal to the marker D12S1609. A maximum two point lod score of 6.56 at theta=0.0 was obtained for D12S343. This gene is distal to DFNA25, a previously identified locus for dominant adult onset hearing loss that maps to 12q21-24. Positional/functional candidate genes in this region include frizzled 10, epimorphin, RAN, and ZFOC1.","Intracranial metastases of stomach cancers are very rare and are associated with a poor prognosis. Of those, metastases of gastric cancers in the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle represent an extremely rare subgroup. Such metastatic lesions may be indistinguishable from vestibular schwannomas in imaging studies and clinical presentation. In this report, we describe a case of gastric signet cell adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle bilaterally and causing bilateral hearing loss, including a unilateral sudden deafness. Due to the co-detection of multiple other intracranial masses in the magnetic resonance imaging scan, the suspected diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastatic disease was clear, and the patient was referred to palliative whole brain radiotherapy. The case further highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cerebellopontine angle lesions to prevent permanent neurological sequelae. Metastatic tumors should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of cerebellopontine angle lesions, especially in patients with a known history of malignant disease.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the word ""deafness"" directly relates to the loss of hearing, whether due to genetic causes as discussed in the genetics and gene mapping context in Text A, or as a result of cancer metastasis leading to hearing loss described in Text B. Despite the varied causes and discussions in each text—genetic linkage analysis in a family lineage for Text A, and metastatic cancer affecting the auditory regions in Text B—the fundamental meaning of ""deafness"" as hearing loss remains consistent across both contexts. Therefore, the semantic usage of the word ""deafness"" has not undergone significant change between the two texts."
46,Deafness,"A study carried out in a total of 1287 workers (artisans and chemical and pharmaceutical production workers), aged between 30 and 59 years and exposed to industrial noise of 83 to 100 dB(A) (LEQ), is presented. The chemical production workers are less exposed to noise than the artisans, who have long been known to be at particular risk, but they are also definitely at risk. The prevalence of hearing defects among these workers is 54%, with deafness in 14%. From the comparison with the pharmaceutical workers, who are exposed to industrial noise not exceeding 86 dB(A), it may be assumed that at least 75% of these cases of deafness are caused by industrial noise at the present or at past places of work.","Over the last three years of hearing aid dispensing, it was observed that among 74 subjects fitted with a linear octave frequency transposition (LOFT) hearing aid, 60 reported partial or complete tinnitus suppression during day and night, an effect still lasting after several months or years of daily use. We report in more details on 38 subjects from whom we obtained quantified measures of tinnitus suppression through visual analog scaling and several additional psychoacoustic and audiometric measures. The long-term suppression seems independent of subject age, and of duration and subjective localization of tinnitus. A small but significant correlation was found with audiogram losses but not with high frequency loss slope. Long-term tinnitus suppression was observed for different etiologies, but with a low success rate for sudden deafness. It should be noted that a majority of subjects (23) had a history of noise exposure. Tinnitus suppression started after a few days of LOFT hearing aid use and reached a maximum after a few weeks of daily use. For nine subjects different amounts of frequency shifting were tried and found more or less successful for long-term tinnitus suppression, no correlation was found with tinnitus pitch. When the use of the LOFT hearing aid was stopped tinnitus reappeared within a day, and after re-using the LOFT aid it disappeared again within a day. For about one third of the 38 subjects a classical amplification or a non linear frequency compression aid was also tried, and no such tinnitus suppression was observed. Besides improvements in audiometric sensitivity to high frequencies and in speech discrimination scores, LOFT can be considered as a remarkable opportunity to suppress tinnitus over a long time scale. From a pathophysiological viewpoint these observations seem to fit with a possible re-attribution of activity to previously deprived cerebral areas corresponding to high frequency coding.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers to the loss of hearing capability in individuals, albeit in varied contexts. Text A discusses deafness primarily as an occupational hazard among workers exposed to industrial noise, linking the severity of deafness to the level of noise exposure in the work environment. Text B, on the other hand, deals with deafness in the context of tinnitus suppression through the use of hearing aids, suggesting that LOFT (linear octave frequency transposition) hearing aids can be beneficial not only for hearing improvement but also for managing tinnitus related to deafness.

In both scenarios, despite the different settings and details discussed, ""deafness"" strictly refers to the condition of reduced or nonexistent hearing ability. There is no significant semantic drift in the usage or connotation of the word between the two periods covered by the texts, demonstrating that the core meaning of ""deafness"" related to hearing impairment remains unchanged."
47,Deafness,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is currently reported as the most common cause of congenital viral induced deafness. However, few systematic studies of the audiovestibular sequelae of this infection are present in the literature. A clinical pathologic study was conducted from 1976 to 1982 to evaluate this. Fifty-two pairs of infant and children's temporal bone studied demonstrated no evidence of CMV endolabyrinthitis even in the single case with evidence of extensive congenital CMV infection. Over 2,000 umbilical cord sera were screened to detect asymptomatic CMV infection with an incidence of 0.38% (and slightly greater than 1% when extrapolated to correct for the sensitivity of the method of detection) in a central Pennsylvania study population. No sensorineural abnormalities were detected in five asymptomatic children and 30 control children. However, three out of six (50%) infants, symptomatic at birth and followed to a mean age of 5.5 years, showed significant and progressive sensorineural loss and vestibular deficits.","The inner ear is responsible for both hearing and balance. These functions are dependent on the correct functioning of mechanosensitive hair cells, which convert sound- and motion-induced stimuli into electrical signals conveyed to the brain. During evolution of the inner ear, the major changes occurred in the hearing organ, whereas the structure of the vestibular organs remained constant in all vertebrates over the same period. Vestibular deficits are highly prevalent in humans, due to multiple intersecting causes: genetics, environmental factors, ototoxic drugs, infections and aging. Studies of deafness genes associated with balance deficits and their corresponding animal models have shed light on the development and function of these two sensory systems. Bilateral vestibular deficits often impair individual postural control, gaze stabilization, locomotion and spatial orientation. The resulting dizziness, vertigo, and/or falls (frequent in elderly populations) greatly affect patient quality of life. In the absence of treatment, prosthetic devices, such as vestibular implants, providing information about the direction, amplitude and velocity of body movements, are being developed and have given promising results in animal models and humans. Novel methods and techniques have led to major progress in gene therapies targeting the inner ear (gene supplementation and gene editing), 3D inner ear organoids and reprograming protocols for generating hair cell-like cells. These rapid advances in multiscale approaches covering basic research, clinical diagnostics and therapies are fostering interdisciplinary research to develop personalized treatments for vestibular disorders.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" is used to describe a health condition characterized by the lack of the ability to hear. Text A directs the focus on deafness primarily as a symptom caused by congenital viral infections (specifically CMV), while Text B elaborates on the broader aspects of deafness and vestibular disorders, including genetic factors and advancements in treatment.

48,Deafness,"The most common form of non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (NSRD) is caused by mutations in the gene GJB2, encoding the protein connexin 26 (Cx26). The mutation c.35delG is found in 30-70% of Caucasian NSRD cases, and is abundant (allele frequency of 0.5-2%) in several European populations, while c.167delT is found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with about 2% frequency. In the current study, using simple PCR-based tests we established an allele frequency of 0.6% in the Hungarian average, and 0.4% in the Romani (Gypsy) populations for the c.35delG mutation, and an allele frequency of 2.4% in the Ashkenazi population for the c.167delT mutation. Our results do not differ significantly from the published data for Caucasian and non-European Ashkenazi populations and they present figures for the Romani population for the first time. Both mutations may be significant causative factors among the NSRD cases of the respective populations in Central Europe.","Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, pigment disturbances, and sensorineural deafness. There are four WS subtypes. WS1 is mostly caused by PAX3 mutations, while MITF, SNAI2, and SOX10 mutations are associated with WS2. More than 100 different disease-causing mutations have been reported in many ethnic groups, but the data from Chinese patients with WS remains poor. Herein we report 18 patients from 15 Chinese WS families, in which five cases were diagnosed as WS1 and the remaining as WS2. Clinical evaluation revealed intense phenotypic variability in Chinese WS patients. Heterochromia iridis and sensorineural hearing loss were the most frequent features (100% and 88.9%, respectively) of the two subtypes. Many brown freckles on normal skin could be a special subtype of cutaneous pigment disturbances in Chinese WS patients. PAX3, MITF, SNAI2, and SOX10 genes mutations were screened for in all the patients. A total of nine mutations in 11 families were identified and seven of them were novel. The SOX10 mutations in WS2 were first discovered in the Chinese population, with an estimated frequency similar to that of MITF mutations, implying SOX10 is an important pathogenic gene in Chinese WS2 cases and should be considered for first-step analysis in WS2, as well as MITF.","- Label: Unchanged

49,Deafness,"Turner's syndrome (TS) is a genetic anomaly that results from complete or partial absence of one X chromosome and is the most commonly occurring chromosomal abnormality in females. While most females with TS present at birth or in early childhood, nearly one quarter present at adult services with primary or secondary amenorrhoea. It is only with the advent of clinics dedicated to adults with TS that we have realised the degree of occult pathology present in this group. Adults with TS are thought to have a reduced life expectancy, mainly due to excess cardiovascular risk, but they may also have multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, deafness, osteoporosis and the attendant problems of oestrogen deficiency and infertility. Many of these features may be affected by the timing of treatments in paediatrics - particularly the timing of growth hormone (GH) and oestrogen use. It is the role of adult TS services to audit the outcome of TS and to inform their paediatric colleagues of the long-term effects of childhood treatments.

50,Deafness,"We report on a patient with neurosensory deafness, cataract and moderate mental retardation showing a constitutional mosaicism with the predominant cell line consisting of a 45,XY,-13,-15,+t(13;15) translocation of the Robertsonian type. By means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a panel of acrocentric pericentromeric probes and various banding techniques, the breakpoints in the translocation were determined at 13q12.1 and 15p13 respectively. Five other cell lines were present, at low percentage, one of them showing a t(13;15) tandem translocation. Interstitial telomeric sequences could be detected at the translocation fusion sites in both the Robertsonian and tandem translocations. The mosaicism appears therefore to be a consequence of chromosomal instability involving the t(13;15) fusion region of the predominant cell line, and related to the presence of interstitial telomeric sequences. The present observation suggests that in the pericentromeric 13q12 region, a gene involved in neurosensory deafness may be located.","X-linked deafness is a rare cause of hereditary isolated hearing impairment estimated as at least 1% or 2% of the non-syndromic hearing loss.

The A 3243 G mutation has been previously reported in association with the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode syndrome (MELAS) and with diabetes mellitus and deafness. To our knowledge, however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not a common feature in people with the A 3243 G mutation and renal failure has not been hitherto reported in association with this mutation.

A comparative cross-sectional analysis was performed in 67 mine workers who have been in contact with Zn and Pb in comparison to a control group containing 67 healthy subjects with the same age and sex. Lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, myleoperoxidase, DNA damage, total antioxidant capacity, Zn, and Pb levels were measured in blood of workers and controls. Clinical examination was accomplished to record any abnormal sign or symptoms. Comparing with controls, the workers showed higher blood levels of superoxide dismutase, myleoperoxidase, glutathione reductase, lipid peroxidation, Pb, and Zn. Workers showed lower DNA-damage as compared with controls. Workers showed clinical symptoms such as memory impairment, less of concentration, insomnia, headache, claudication, epigasteric, inappetence, agitation, tremor, decreasing of reflection of deep tendon, conduction deafness of ear, and fatigue. The workers had extra normal levels of Pb (0.9-3 microg/dL) and showed oxidative stress. Taken together, the results indicate that exposure to combination of Pb and Zn in mine elevates total antioxidant capacity of body in a reflex to overcome to oxidative stress.

There is a wide range of asymmetrical hearing loss: single-sided deafness is the end of the spectrum. Amplification in asymmetrical hearing loss is usually difficult, it is often not possible to adequately aid the poorer ear; therefore patients often experience compromised hearing with adequate aiding of their better ear only.

In Text B, deafness appears in the discussion of asymmetrical hearing loss and cochlear implantation, specifically mentioning ""single-sided deafness"" as part of the spectrum of hearing loss conditions. Both texts use ""deafness"" to describe a condition characterized by an inability to hear, albeit associated with differing medical scenarios. The continuity in referring to hearing impairment as ""deafness"" across different contexts of treatment and medical understanding over time signals that there has been no significant semantic drift in the term's meaning."
53,Deafness,"The pathogenetic mechanism of the human mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene mutation at position 1555, associated with non-syndromic deafness and aminoglycoside-induced deafness, has been investigated in 33 transformants obtained by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines into human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-less (rho *206) cells. In this nearly constant nuclear background, 15 transformants derived from five symptomatic individuals from a large Arab-Israeli family, carrying this mutation in homoplasmic form, exhibited significant decreases compared with nine control transformants in the rate of growth in a medium containing galactose instead of glucose, as well as in the rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis and of substrate-dependent respiration. Most significantly, these decreases were very similar to those observed in nine transformants derived from three asymptomatic members of the family. This result in transmitochondrial cybrids is in contrast to the differences in the same parameters previously demonstrated between the original lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the symptomatic and asymptomatic members of the Arab-Israeli family. In addition, the intragroup variability in biochemical dysfunction among the lymphoblastoid cell lines from different symptomatic or asymptomatic or control individuals was significantly reduced in the derived mitochondrial transformants carrying the same nuclear background. These observations provide strong genetic and biochemical evidence in support of the idea that the nuclear background plays a determinant role in the phenotypic manifestation of the non-syndromic deafness associated with the A1555G mutation.","We examined the clinical, molecular and genetic features of a 16-year-old boy (XP2GO) with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and progressive neurological symptoms.

Besides recurrent conjunctivitis and bilateral pterygium, only mild freckling was present on his lips. He shows absent deep tendon reflexes, progressive sensorineural deafness and progressive mental retardation. MRI shows diffuse frontal cerebral atrophy and dilated ventricles. Symptoms of trichothiodystrophy (brittle hair with a tiger-tail banding pattern on polarized microscopy) or Cockayne syndrome (cachectic dwarfism, cataracts, pigmentary retinopathy and spasticity) were absent. XP2GO fibroblasts showed reduced post-UV cell survival (D(37) = 3.8 J/m(2)), reduced nucleotide excision repair, reduced expression of XPD mRNA and an undetectable level of XPD protein. Mutational analysis of the XPD gene in XP2GO revealed two different mutations: a common p.Arg683Trp amino acid change (c.2047C>T) known to be associated with XP and a novel frameshift mutation c.2009delG (p.Gly670Alafs*39). The latter mutation potentially behaves as a null allele. While not preventing neurological degeneration, early diagnosis and rigorous sun protection can result in minimal skin disease without cancer in XP patients.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""deafness"" refers specifically to a genetic condition associated with a mitochondrial mutation that causes non-syndromic deafness, highlighting the condition's biological underpinnings and correlation with specific genetic anomalies. The emphasis is on the genetic and molecular aspects of the deafness directly related to the mutation. In Text B, ""deafness"" is described as part of a broader diagnostic spectrum of a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum, indicating a symptom accompanying other neurological and sensory impairments. Here, deafness is mentioned as a progressive condition in a complex clinical profile, suggesting its presentation alongside other neurodegenerative symptoms without a direct link to specific genetic mutations like those detailed in Text A. This broader and more integrated view of deafness in a systemic disease context differentiates it from the more isolated, mutation-specific view in Text A."
54,Deafness,"Cortical deafness in a patient with multiple sclerosis is reported. Complete recovery from total deafness was seen following stages of auditory agnosia and pure word deafness. The otological and neurophysiological studies suggested lesions in subcortical white matter. This report stresses the rarity of the condition, its subcortical origin and good prognosis.","Gap junctions consist of arrays of intercellular channels composed of integral membrane proteins called connexin in vertebrates. Gap junction channels regulate the passage of ions and biological molecules between adjacent cells and, therefore, are critically important in many biological activities, including development, differentiation, neural activity, and immune response. Mutations in connexin genes are associated with several human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, skin disease, deafness, and developmental abnormalities. The activity of gap junction channels is regulated by the membrane voltage, intracellular microenvironment, interaction with other proteins, and phosphorylation. Each connexin channel has its own property for conductance and molecular permeability. A number of studies have tried to reveal the molecular architecture of the channel pore that should confer the connexin-specific permeability/selectivity properties and molecular basis for the gating and regulation. In this review, we give an overview of structural studies and describe the structural and functional relationship of gap junction channels.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the usage of the word ""deafness"" primarily focuses on a clinical description of a specific patient's auditory condition related to multiple sclerosis, highlighting aspects like recovery and the nature of the auditory disorder. Here, ""deafness"" refers to an observable clinical symptom or condition that involves complete loss of hearing temporally associated with neurological issues. On the other hand, Text B discusses ""deafness"" in a broader scientific context, particularly focusing on genetic factors causing the condition as linked to mutations in specific connexin genes affecting gap junctions. This usage emphasizes a molecular and genetic perspective of deafness as a part of wider biological and developmental disorders, thereby shifting the context from a purely clinical symptom to a more encompassing biological and genetic view. Thus, the semantic field of ""deafness"" has expanded and changed to include not only the phenotypic manifestation but also detailed underlying genetic causes and mechanisms."
55,Deafness,"A study of 212 Indian children at the V.A. Naik School for Deaf was undertaken to determine the aetiology of their deafness. Undifferentiated autosomal recessive deafness was more frequent among Muslim patients--a population with a high incidence of consanguineous marriages--than among Tamils and Hindus. Although fewer than expected genetic syndromes were identified, Waardenburg's syndrome was present in 2% of the pupils. A firm diagnosis of acquired deafness was obtained in 32 children (15%).","Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare, progressive and incurable genetic disorder associated with progressive hearing loss and eventual deafness.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the use of the word ""deafness"" maintains a consistent meaning as a condition characterized by the loss of hearing. Text A discusses deafness in the context of children of different ethnic backgrounds and identifies various causes and incidences of deafness, such as genetic factors. Text B discusses deafness as part of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), emphasizing its progression and impact on patients’ lives. In both cases, ""deafness"" is referred to as a medical condition resulting in the loss of hearing ability.

56,Deafness,"Association of sensorineural deafness and progressive retinitis pigmentosa with and without a vestibular abnormality is the hallmark of Usher syndrome and involves at least 12 loci among three different clinical subtypes. Genes identified for the more commonly inherited loci are USH2A (encoding usherin), MYO7A (encoding myosin VIIa), CDH23 (encoding cadherin 23), PCDH15 (encoding protocadherin 15), USH1C (encoding harmonin), USH3A (encoding clarin 1), and USH1G (encoding SANS). Transcripts from all these genes are found in many tissues/cell types other than the inner ear and retina, but all are uniquely critical for retinal and cochlear cell function. Many of these protein products have been demonstrated to have direct interactions with each other and perform an essential role in stereocilia homeostasis.","Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome (CDS); is a rare lipid storage disease with ichthyosis, hepatomegaly, myopathy, neuropathy, deafness, and ocular findings.

- Reason: In both texts, the use of the target word ""deafness"" refers to its primary meaning as a condition of lacking the ability to hear. 
  - In Text A, ""deafness"" is discussed as part of Usher syndrome, a genetic condition that involves sensorineural deafness coupled with retinitis pigmentosa. The context here emphasizes the genetic and biological aspects contributing to deafness.
  - In Text B, ""deafness"" appears as a symptom of Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome, another rare genetic disorder. It is listed among various other symptoms, showing the multifaceted impacts of the syndrome, including on auditory functions.
  
The central meaning of ""deafness"" as the state or condition of being unable to hear remains consistent in both texts, despite being applied in different medical and genetic disorder contexts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the term ""deafness"" between the two texts. The term continues to denote the same auditory condition without change in implication or connotation."
57,Deafness,"Accurate congenital rubella syndrome surveillance in Japan is of great interest because of the hypothesis that the Japanese rubella virus was less virulent than the strains prevalent in Europe and the Americas 20 years ago. A nationwide survey of deaf children with a history of maternal rubella in special schools for the deaf in Japan yielded a total of 365 deaf school children with congenital rubella syndrome born between 1963 and 1982. The overall average prevalence was 0.31 case per 100,000 population, and the incidence was 0.1-6.1 cases per 100,000 annual live births in Japan. If one considers the decrease in the number of deaf children attending special schools for the deaf because of the recent adoption of the policy of integrating deaf children into ordinary schools, the number of cases of congenital rubella syndrome might actually be much greater than that revealed by this survey and much greater than the 88 cases previously reported in Japan. Among the 365 cases who had deafness, 8.2% were found to have cataract (with and without congenital heart disease), and 11.0% were found to be complicated by congenital heart disease (but without cataract).","Most cases of acute otitis media (AOM) resolve even without antibiotic treatment. In the pre-antibiotic era, AOM complications were common and could lead to deafness and neurological sequelae. With the use of antibiotics, the complications have become less frequent, but they may still evolve. The possible increase in the occurrence of complications has to be considered if we start treating AOM more conservatively and if bacterial antibiotic resistance situation becomes more problematic. These rare but possibly lethal complications should be diagnosed and treated promptly. The need for cochlear implantation has to be evaluated soon after an episode of meningitis if deafness is suspected.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B from different time periods, the word ""deafness"" is used to denote the condition of lacking the ability to hear. In Text A from an earlier period, ""deafness"" is discussed in the context of congenital rubella syndrome in children, which results directly from a viral infection during the mother's pregnancy. In Text B, the focus shifts to acute otitis media, a common infection where ""deafness"" could occur as a secondary complication if not properly treated. In both instances, the term refers to the medical condition of hearing loss without a shift in meaning, keeping the core focus consistent: the impairment or loss of hearing function as a health issue. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the word ""deafness"" between the two time periods provided."
58,Deafness,"Organisms rapidly adapt to severe environmental stress by inducing the expression of a wide array of heat shock proteins as part of a larger cellular response program. We have used a genomics approach to identify novel heat shock-induced genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The uncharacterized open reading frame (ORF) YLR251W was found to be required for both metabolism and tolerance of ethanol during heat shock. YLR251W has significant homology to the mammalian peroxisomal membrane protein Mpv17, and Mpv17(-/-) mice exhibit age-onset glomerulosclerosis, deafness, hypertension, and, ultimately, death by renal failure. Expression of Mpv17 in ylr251wdelta cells complements the 37 degrees C ethanol growth defect, suggesting that these proteins are functional orthologs. We have therefore renamed ORF YLR251W as SYM1 (for ""stress-inducible yeast Mpv17""). In contrast to the peroxisomal localization of Mpv17, we find that Sym1 is an integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition, transcriptional profiling of sym1delta cells uncovered changes in gene expression, including dysregulation of a number of ethanol-repressed genes, exclusively at 37 degrees C relative to wild-type results. Together, these data suggest an important metabolic role for Sym1 in mitochondrial function during heat shock. Furthermore, this study establishes Sym1 as a potential model for understanding the role of Mpv17 in kidney disease and cardiovascular biology.","Presents a citation for McCay Vernon, who received the Award for Distinguished Senior Career Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest ""for fifty-five years of distinguished contributions toward improving the lives of both deaf and deaf-blind individuals.""

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" retains its primary meaning related to the condition of lacking the sense of hearing. In Text A, ""deafness"" is mentioned as a condition that arises in mice lacking a specific protein, which provides a biological context to understanding a medical condition. The text discusses the implications of a particular gene expression related to various health issues including deafness as a consequence of genetic/biological dysfunction.

In Text B, ""deafness"" is situated in a psychological and societal context where the focus is on the contributions of an individual to improving the lives of people who are deaf or deaf-blind. The usage of ""deafness"" here pertains directly to the auditory condition impacting humans and is discussed in terms of societal and psychological research and contributions.

Despite different disciplinary perspectives (biological in Text A and psychological/societal in Text B), the core meaning of ""deafness"" as a state of being without hearing remains fundamentally the same across both texts. There are no indications that the term has shifted to represent something beyond the medical condition of hearing loss; therefore, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
59,Deafness,"The authors provide an overview of 21 articles from several countries focusing on families with deaf members published in the literary issues of the American Annals of the Deaf from 1996 to 2000. Four categories were identified: Interaction and Involvement, Support Services, Stress and Coping, and Decision Making. The articles represent a commendable expansion of focus from the mother-child dyad to increased attention to fathers, siblings, extended family members, and significant nonfamily members such as deaf adults. The heterogeneity of families was a striking factor, even within those studies dealing with relatively homogeneous populations. Services appeared to be most effective within middle-class, educated family units, illustrating the need for more comprehensive services sensitive to the needs of families from less affluent backgrounds and with lower levels of education. In general, services to families with deaf children may be characterized as better than in the past but still in need of significant sensitivity and improvement. The presence of a deaf child in a family with hearing parents may cause stress, but parents have the flexibility to respond in a positive and beneficial way, especially when provided adequate information and support. The idea that hearing parents go through a grieving process involving the identification of deafness in their child seems to be an overstatement.","  Speech is the most used communication method between humans and it involves
the perception of auditory and visual channels. Automatic speech recognition
focuses on interpreting the audio signals, although the video can provide
information that is complementary to the audio. Exploiting the visual
information, however, has proven challenging. On one hand, researchers have
reported that the mapping between phonemes and visemes (visual units) is
one-to-many because there are phonemes which are visually similar and
indistinguishable between them. On the other hand, it is known that some people
are very good lip-readers (e.g: deaf people). We study the limit of visual only
speech recognition in controlled conditions. With this goal, we designed a new
database in which the speakers are aware of being read and aim to facilitate
lip-reading. In the literature, there are discrepancies on whether
hearing-impaired people are better lip-readers than normal-hearing people.
Then, we analyze if there are differences between the lip-reading abilities of
9 hearing-impaired and 15 normal-hearing people. Finally, human abilities are
compared with the performance of a visual automatic speech recognition system.
In our tests, hearing-impaired participants outperformed the normal-hearing
participants but without reaching statistical significance. Human observers
were able to decode 44% of the spoken message. In contrast, the visual only
automatic system achieved 20% of word recognition rate. However, if we repeat
the comparison in terms of phonemes both obtained very similar recognition
rates, just above 50%. This suggests that the gap between human lip-reading and
automatic speech-reading might be more related to the use of context than to
the ability to interpret mouth appearance.

60,Deafness,A case of Pure Word Deafness (PWD) with bilateral perisylvian softenings is described. The C.A.T. findings fit the classical anatomical counterpart of PWD: a nearly complete acoustic disconnection of the Wernicke area. The associated severe apraxic disorders are discussed.,"  Sign language is commonly used by deaf or mute people to communicate but
requires extensive effort to master. It is usually performed with the fast yet
delicate movement of hand gestures, body posture, and even facial expressions.
Current Sign Language Recognition (SLR) methods usually extract features via
deep neural networks and suffer overfitting due to limited and noisy data.
Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention
due to its subject-invariant and background-invariant nature, whereas
skeleton-based SLR is still under exploration due to the lack of hand
annotations. Some researchers have tried to use off-line hand pose trackers to
obtain hand keypoints and aid in recognizing sign language via recurrent neural
networks. Nevertheless, none of them outperforms RGB-based approaches yet. To
this end, we propose a novel Skeleton Aware Multi-modal Framework with a Global
Ensemble Model (GEM) for isolated SLR (SAM-SLR-v2) to learn and fuse
multi-modal feature representations towards a higher recognition rate.
Specifically, we propose a Sign Language Graph Convolution Network (SL-GCN) to
model the embedded dynamics of skeleton keypoints and a Separable
Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network (SSTCN) to exploit skeleton features. The
skeleton-based predictions are fused with other RGB and depth based modalities
by the proposed late-fusion GEM to provide global information and make a
faithful SLR prediction. Experiments on three isolated SLR datasets demonstrate
that our proposed SAM-SLR-v2 framework is exceedingly effective and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with significant margins. Our code will be

- Reason: In Text A, the target word ""Deafness"" refers specifically to a medical condition known as Pure Word Deafness (PWD), implying a disconnect in auditory processing within the brain that impacts the ability to understand spoken words while other auditory abilities may remain intact. The context is purely medical and focused on the internal auditory processing issues.

  In Text B, ""Deafness"" is discussed in relation to sign language use among deaf individuals, focusing on communication techniques and technological advancements in sign language recognition. The usage shifts from a purely medical perspective to an accessibility and technological context, highlighting social and communication aspects, as well as the community and culture among deaf individuals.

  This change in context from an internal, medical definition to technological and socio-communicative applications suggests a notable semantic drift in the term ""Deafness"" over time."
61,Deafness,"Waardenburg's syndrome is characterized by deafness and pigment disorders of the eyes, hair and skin. Two types are distinguished; e.g. type I with dystopia canthorum and type II without dystopia canthorum. In Kenya 12 out of 724 pupils of schoools for the deaf were found to suffer from the syndrome. Ten of these belonged to eight families; 20 other members of these families had signs of the syndrome. Of these 30 patients 18 had type I, 12 type II. The expression of most characteristics in these Kenyan patients was almost the same as in Caucasians. The mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant, as in Caucasians. The interocular distances were measured in 168 healthy children and adults of the Luo tribe. In most age groups slightly larger values were found than in the Caucasian race. For the diagnosis of dystopia canthorum this should be taken into account.","A better understanding of melodic pitch perception in cochlear implants (CIs) may guide signal processing and/or rehabilitation techniques to improve music perception and appreciation in CI patients. In this study, the mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to infrequent changes in 5-tone pitch contours was obtained in CI users and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Melodic contour identification (MCI) was also measured. Results showed that MCI performance was poorer in CI than in NH subjects; the MMNs were missing in all CI subjects for the 1-semitone contours. The MMNs with the 5-semitone contours were observed in a smaller proportion of CI than NH subjects. Results suggest that encoding of pitch contour changes in CI users appears to be degraded, most likely due to the limited pitch cues provided by the CI and deafness-related compromise of brain substrates.","- Label: Unchanged

62,Deafness,"A sample of 64 postlinguistically profoundly to totally deaf adult cochlear implant patients were tested without lipreading by means of the Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) sentence test 3 months postoperatively. Preoperative promontory stimulation results (thresholds, gap detection, and frequency discrimination), age, duration of profound deafness, cause of deafness, lipreading ability, postoperative intracochlear thresholds and dynamic ranges for electrical stimulation, depth of insertion of the electrode array into the scala tympani, and number of electrodes in use were considered as possible factors that might be related to the postoperative sentence scores. A multiple regression analysis with stepwise inclusion of independent variables indicated that good gap detection and frequency discrimination during preoperative promontory testing, larger numbers of electrodes in use, and greater dynamic ranges for intracochlear electrical stimulation were associated with better CID scores. The CID scores tended to decrease with longer periods of profound deafness.","We present an 8-year-old boy with folate receptor alpha (FRα) defect and congenital deafness with labyrinthine aplasia, microtia and microdontia (LAMM syndrome).

64,Deafness,"Developmental abnormalities of the peripheral auditory structures in an experimental animal model of the cardio-auditory (long QT with deafness) syndrome are described. Prolonged QT intervals in the electrocardiogram and deafness were induced in chick embryos by removal of tissue in the region of the right nodose and otic placodes on the first day of incubation. Electrocardiographic recordings, cochlear potential and brainstem auditory evoked responses were recorded in late embryonic life (E17), and used to identify embryos with long QTs and deafness. External and middle ears were evaluated under a dissecting microscope. Inner ears were evaluated in histological sections. Anomalies of the external and middle ears, such as the external auditory meatus, tympanic membrane and stapes, were attributed to disturbance of neural crest development. Anomalies of the inner ear, such as a complete absence of the cochlear duct and auditory nerve, or decreased length of the basilar papilla, were attributed to disturbance of otic placode development. The fact that a small lesion in the region of the nodose and otic placodes during early development in the chick animal model can produce a long QT interval in the electrocardiogram and deafness suggests that abnormal development in this region early in development might be the underlying cause of the human syndrome.","Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) pathogenic variants are identified in more than 90% of infants and children with CHARGE (Coloboma of the iris, retina, and/or optic disk; congenital Heart defects, choanal Atresia, Retardation of growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and characteristic outer and inner Ear anomalies and deafness) syndrome.

  - In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" is used primarily to describe the absence or loss of hearing capability. In Text A, deafness is described within the context of an experimental model relating to developmental abnormalities affecting auditory structures. Here, deafness is a condition largely associated with specific genetic manipulations during early development, affecting hearing through alterations in peripheral auditory structures.
  - In Text B, the term again appears in a genetic context where ""deafness"" is part of the broader phenotype described in CHARGE syndrome. This condition similarly associates deafness with genetic abnormalities that lead to sensory impairments including hearing loss.

Neurotologic examinations revealed spontaneous right-beating nystagmus, left canal paresis, absence of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in the left ear, and absence of responses to a left galvanic body sway test (GBST). The vertigo resolved 7 days after onset. However, the left hearing impairment progressed to complete deafness.

66,Deafness,"Syphilis, both congenital and acquired, may cause sensori-neural hearing loss. Congenital syphilis presents in two forms: early (infantile), and late (tardive). Acquired syphilis, both secondary and tertiary, may cause deafness. The clinical course of the acquired and congenital forms are similar. Sensori-neural hearing loss with low discrimination scores may affect both ears simultaneously or sequentially, and vestibular complaints are common. A clinical diagnosis can be made on the basis of history, the presence of other stigmata of syphilis, and serological tests, including the FTA-ABS. The histopathology of acquired and congenital forms is indistinguishable and is essentially twofold: first, syphilis may cause a miningo-neurolabyrinthitis with round cell infiltration of the labyrinth and VIIIth nerve as the predominant lesion in early congenital syphilis and the acute meningitides of secondary and tertiary acquired syphilis. Second, syphilis may cause a perivascular round cell osteitis of the temporal bone with secondary involvement of the membranous labyrinth in both late congenital and acquired late latent or tertiary syphilis. Endolymphatic hydrops may be seen in both the congenital and acquired forms. A case of bilateral sequential sudden deafness due to acquired syphilis is presented. A histological diagnosis of syphilitic involvement of the temporal bone was made by incudectomy. Treatment with prednisone and penicillin over a three-month period resulted in return of good cochlear function in one ear.","To describe the inheritance patterns and auditory phenotype features of 3 Canadian families with mutations in 2 X-linked ""deafness"" genes (DFNX).","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers to the condition of profound hearing loss. Text A discusses ""deafness"" as a consequence of syphilis, detailing both congenital and acquired forms that result in sensori-neural hearing loss, effectively illustrating the medical context of the term. Text B continues to use ""deafness"" in a similar medical context, focusing on genetic causes related to mutations in specific genes affecting hearing. Both instances emphasize the condition relating to loss of hearing, and the semantic usage remains overwhelmingly aligned with the medical definition of severe hearing impairment. Therefore, the term has not undergone significant semantic drift between the texts."
67,Deafness,"Although sudden deafness has many causes, it is often a sensorineural hearing loss with an abrupt onset and unknown origin. The majority of these latter cases are unilateral in their occurrences, while bilateral simultaneous involvement is rarely seen. During the past 13 years, we have treated 997 patients with sudden deafness. All patients were seen at our university hospital within 2 weeks after the onset of their hearing losses and were observed until the hearing level was fixed. Among them, 10 patients were found to have bilateral simultaneous onsets. The average age and the incidence of vestibular symptoms were similar to those with unilateral deafness. The hearing recovery was much better in the ear with the lesser deafness. No improvement was observed on the side with no sound perception. Those patients in whom common cold and fever seemed to trigger the onset of deafness were also noted to have high viral antibody titers, and were more commonly seen than were those cases with unilateral deafness.","  Sign language is commonly used by deaf or speech impaired people to
communicate but requires significant effort to master. Sign Language
Recognition (SLR) aims to bridge the gap between sign language users and others
by recognizing signs from given videos. It is an essential yet challenging task
since sign language is performed with the fast and complex movement of hand
gestures, body posture, and even facial expressions. Recently, skeleton-based
action recognition attracts increasing attention due to the independence
between the subject and background variation. However, skeleton-based SLR is
still under exploration due to the lack of annotations on hand keypoints. Some
efforts have been made to use hand detectors with pose estimators to extract
hand key points and learn to recognize sign language via Neural Networks, but
none of them outperforms RGB-based methods. To this end, we propose a novel
Skeleton Aware Multi-modal SLR framework (SAM-SLR) to take advantage of
multi-modal information towards a higher recognition rate. Specifically, we
propose a Sign Language Graph Convolution Network (SL-GCN) to model the
embedded dynamics and a novel Separable Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network
(SSTCN) to exploit skeleton features. RGB and depth modalities are also
incorporated and assembled into our framework to provide global information
that is complementary to the skeleton-based methods SL-GCN and SSTCN. As a
result, SAM-SLR achieves the highest performance in both RGB (98.42\%) and

  In Text A, the usage of the word ""deafness"" primarily revolves around its medical aspect, focusing on its causes, manifestations, and the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The context is strictly clinical, dealing with the physical condition of hearing loss, its epidemiology, and recovery aspects.

  In contrast, Text B utilizes the word ""deafness"" within the framework of sign language and technological advancements aimed at bridging communication gaps between deaf individuals and the hearing world. The focus here is not purely on the medical condition but on social and technological solutions (like sign language recognition and machine learning models) that facilitate better communication for those affected by deafness.

  This shift from a medical-health frame in Text A to a socio-technological frame in Text B signifies a significant change in the contexts and connotations associated with the word ""deafness,"" reflecting a broader perception that includes social integration and technological solutions rather than just focusing on the ailment and its direct medical implications."
68,Deafness,Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by profound deafness in childhood and goiter. We report a case of Pendred syndrome in a 27-year-old woman who had a diffuse goiter and progressive sensorineural hearing loss with fluctuation and a missense mutation (His723Arg) in the PDS gene identified in a homozygous state. Audiological findings were observed clinically over a 20-year period. Progressive hearing loss with fluctuation occurred before age 12 years. An enlarged vestibular aqueduct with enlargement of the endolymphatic duct and sac was confirmed with 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging hydrography.,"We present a 4-year-old girl with congenital profound sensorineural deafness associated with inner ear malformation (incomplete partition type II, enlarged vestibule, and enlarged vestibular aqueduct). The proposita also had pseudocleft lips, skin defects, auricle abnormalities, and unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney, leading to the diagnosis of branchio-oculo-facial (BOF) syndrome. Mutation analysis of the TFAP2A gene showed a de novo deletion of 18 and insertion of 6 nucleotides, resulting in deletion of amino acids LPGARR and insertion of RI between amino acids 276 and 281. Altered amino acids are located within the basic DNA binding and dimerization domains of TFAP2A. Previously reported amino acid substitutions in TFAP2A involved only DNA binding domain in four patients with BOF syndrome who were not reported to have profound sensorineural deafness. Our report implies that the localization of mutations in TFAP2A might be responsible with the phenotypic findings in BOF syndrome.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" maintains the same fundamental meaning relating to the condition of profound sensorineural hearing loss. Text A describes deafness as a primary characteristic of Pendred syndrome alongside goiter, while Text B discusses deafness in the context of branchio-oculo-facial syndrome, another genetic disorder. In both cases, the use of ""deafness"" refers directly to a significant hearing impairment inherent to an individual, linked with genetic factors and accompanying syndromic features. There is no indication that the concept or understanding of deafness as a medical condition has shifted between the two texts, despite being associated with different genetic conditions."
69,Deafness,"Mutations in the gene encoding connexin-26 (specified GJB2) have been shown to be a major cause of nonsyndromic recessive deafness (NSRD), and a single mutation 35delG in the GJB2 gene accounts for the majority of cases of NSRD. This mutation was screened in France and in other European populations by a reliable PCR method. We present here a meta-analysis of the 35delG frequencies in 4123 random controls from 20 European countries, and show that the mutation is more frequent in the south of Europe than in the north; a north-south increasing cline of 35delG frequencies is established (r = -0.527).","Conclusion This study demonstrated excellent hearing recovery following the combined treatment of diuretic and oral steroid, and electrocochleography (ECoG) was significantly higher than normal side. This study reports characteristics of acute low-tone hearing loss (ALHL) that show the greater low-tone hearing loss, the higher ECoG, and excellent recovery, even-though low-tone hearing loss is worse, which can be different compared with sudden deafness. Objective To analyze ALHL without vertigo, this study compared the ALHL group with all patients exhibiting low-tone hearing loss and ear fullness. Hearing changes and vestibular functions were analyzed. Materials and methods ALHL was defined as a mean hearing loss of ≥ 30 dB at 125, 250, and 500 Hz, and ≤ 20 dB at 2, 4, and 8 kHz. From 156 cases of low-tone hearing loss of more than 10 dB without vertigo, 31 met the ALHL criteria and were subjected to audio-vestibular assessments including PTA, ECoG, vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) testing, and caloric testing. Results In ALHL, low-tone hearing loss was 42.7 ± 9.5 dB, and 83.9% of ALHL significantly recovered by more than 10 dB. The ECoG in ALHL was 0.334 ± 0.11 (higher than 0.25 ± 0.08 on the normal side) and ECoG abnormality was 35.5% (the greater low-tone hearing loss, the higher ECoG value). ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" remains connected to its core medical meaning related to the condition of hearing loss. 

  In Text A, ""deafness"" specifically relates to nonsyndromic recessive deafness (NSRD), discussing it in the context of genetic mutations, thus exploring the biological or hereditary aspects contributing to this condition. It is focused on understanding the causes of deafness as influenced by genetics.

  In Text B, while also discussing medical aspects, the focus shifts to treatment outcomes and characteristics of a specific type of hearing loss termed as acute low-tone hearing loss (ALHL). Here, deafness is examined in terms of diagnostic measures, symptomology, and treatment efficacy.

  Despite Text B covering different specific aspects and conditions related to hearing loss (like ALHL), the fundamental meaning of 'deafness' as hearing impairment or loss does not show significant semantic drift. Both texts use the term within a medical context, discussing causes, characteristics, and management of hearing loss conditions, albeit with different emphases and specifics."

Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for smoking habits, drinking habits, dietary habits, environmental noise, past history of disease, sleeping hours, appetite, fatigue, incidence of common cold were obtained. Fatigue (OR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.36-7.90) and loss of appetite (OR: 8:00; 95% CI: 1.00-64.0) elevated the risk for sudden deafness. Those who ate many fresh vegetables were at a decreased risk (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.24-0.96 for light-colored vegetables, OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.30-1.02 for green-yellow vegetables). Personal histories of hypertension and thyroid disease, and susceptibility to colds appeared to be positively associated with the risk (0.05 < P < 0.10).

72,Deafness,"Primary jugular foramen (JF) tumor, such as glomus jugular tumor or JF schwannoma, may manifest as a lower cranial nerve deficit; in addition, it can be accompanied by deafness or vertigo if it affects the cranial nerve (CN) VIII. Recently, we encountered JF schwannoma 1 and glomus jugulare tumor 1. Both cases invaded the adjacent cerebellopontine angle, leading to cochleo-vestibular deficits prior to the operation. After surgery, recovery of the audiovestibular function, including hearing, auditory brainstem response and caloric response, was anticipated in both patients. Therefore, cochleo-vestibular deficits in JF tumors can be attributed to compression neuropathy, rather than tumor infiltration.","Hearing loss has been identified as a major modifiable risk factors for dementia. Adult candidates for cochlear implantation (CI) represent a population at risk of hearing loss-associated cognitive decline. This study investigated the effect of demographics, habits, and medical and psychological risk factors on cognition within such a cohort. Data from 34 consecutive adults with post-lingual deafness scheduled for CI were analyzed. Pure tone audiometry (PTA4) and Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) were recorded. The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for Hearing impaired individuals (RBANS-H) was used to measure cognition.

Conversely, Text B expands the notion of ""deafness"" to include broader societal and psychological implications, linking it as a risk factor to cognitive decline and assessing its impacts on cognitive functioning in adults. In this context, ""deafness"" is not only seen as a medical symptom but also as a condition with significant long-term socio-psychological consequences, emphasizing the preventive and intervention aspects.

73,Deafness,"Many patients suffering from episodic vertigo have no cochlear symptoms. These patients have so far been diagnosed as having Meniere's disease of the vestibular type. However, the underlying mechanisms are still to be established. In the present study, we investigated platelet aggregability in patients with dizziness, Meniere's disease, sudden deafness and facial palsy, to examine whether abnormalities in platelet aggregation is one of the causes of episodic vertigo. In 36 patients with dizziness, in 13 with Meniere's disease, in 7 sudden deafness, and in 7 facial palsy, platelet aggregability to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was assessed by optometric technique. It was found that platelet aggregability was increased in the patients with dizziness as well as with Meniere's disease, sudden deafness and facial palsy and only the two former patient groups showed a tendency of hyperlipidemia. The administration of antiplatelet and lipidemia drugs resulted in no recurrence of vertigo during at least 3 months' follow-up. Hence, the results of our study suggest that a possible initializing factor of vertigo without cochlear symptoms might be disturbed microcirculation due to platelet hyperaggregability.","Proteins and protein networks associated with cochlear pathogenesis in the Ames waltzer (av) mouse, a model for deafness in Usher syndrome 1F (USH1F), were identified. Cochlear protein from wild-type and av mice at postnatal day 30, a time point in which cochlear pathology is well established, was analyzed by quantitative 2D gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry (MS). The analytic gel resolved 2270 spots; 69 spots showed significant changes in intensity in the av cochlea compared with the control. The cochlin protein was identified in 20 peptide spots, most of which were up-regulated, while a few were down-regulated. Analysis of MS sequence data showed that, in the av cochlea, a set of full-length isoforms of cochlin was up-regulated, while isoforms missing the N-terminal FCH/LCCL domain were down-regulated. Protein interaction network analysis of all differentially expressed proteins was performed with Metacore software. That analysis revealed a number of statistically significant candidate protein networks predicted to be altered in the affected cochlea. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of select candidates from the proteomic and bioinformatic investigations showed up-regulation of Coch mRNA and those of p53, Brn3a and Nrf2, transcription factors linked to stress response and survival. Increased mRNA of Brn3a and Nrf2 has previously been associated with increased expression of cochlin in human glaucomatous trabecular meshwork. Our report strongly suggests that increased level of cochlin is an important etiologic factor leading to the degeneration of cochlear neuroepithelia in the USH1F model.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The term ""deafness"" in both texts retains its fundamental meaning related to a condition of the inability to hear. In Text A, the target word ""deafness"" appears within the context of medical conditions affecting hearing, specifically mentioned alongside other auditory and vestibular conditions like Meniere's disease and sudden deafness. The focus is on identifying causes and potential treatments that could alleviate or prevent symptoms associated with these conditions, including deafness. Text B also discusses ""deafness"" primarily within a biological and pathological context, focusing on the molecular and genetic aspects leading to hearing loss in a disease model for Usher syndrome, a genetic condition that affects hearing.

In both texts, despite the variations in specifics (biomedical research in Text A and molecular-genetic detail in Text B), ""deafness"" fundamentally concerns the loss or impairment of hearing capacity. Both texts approach the term from a medical and clinical perspective, implying no significant semantic drift in the term's use over time between the two excerpts provided."

- Reason: In Text A, the context presents ""deafness"" as a clinical symptom associated with a condition called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, which lists it alongside other physical symptoms and challenges that the described patients face. The usage demonstrates a straightforward reference to ""deafness"" as a medical or health-related condition.

  However, in Text B, though incomplete, the context suggests that ""deafness"" is being considered from a broader social or functional impact perspective. The phrase ""impairments such as deafness are particularly relevant to the extent that they lead to deprivation"" implies a shift in focus from merely describing a condition as a symptom to discussing its broader social and psychological effects and the deprivation it may cause in societal participation or quality of life. This suggests an expansion of the semantic field of ""deafness"" from a strictly medical symptom to a factor influencing social and psychological aspects of life, indicating semantic drift in its usage over time."

78,Deafness,"Mitochondrial respiration, the most efficient metabolic pathway devoted to energy production, is at the crosspoint of 2 quite different genetic systems, the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). The latter encodes a few essential components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and has unique molecular and genetic properties that account for some of the peculiar features of mitochondrial disorders. However, the perpetuation, propagation, and expression of mtDNA, the majority of the subunits of the respiratory complexes, as well as a number of genes involved in their assembly and turnover, are contained in the nuclear genome. Although mitochondrial disorders have been known for more than 30 years, a major breakthrough in their understanding has come much later, with the discovery of an impressive, ever-increasing number of mutations of mitochondrial DNA. Partial deletions or duplications of mtDNA, or maternally inherited point mutations, have been associated with well-defined clinical syndromes. However, phenotypes transmitted as mendelian traits have also been identified. These include clinical entities defined on the basis of specific biochemical defects, and also a few autosomal dominant or recessive syndromes associated with multiple deletions or tissue-specific depletion of mtDNA. Given the complexity of mitochondrial genetics and biochemistry, the clinical manifestations of mitochondrial disorders are extremely heterogenous. They range from lesions of single tissues or structures, such as the optic nerve in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy or the cochlea in maternally inherited nonsyndromic deafness, to more widespread lesions including myopathies, encephalomyopathies, cardiopathies, or complex multisystem syndromes.

Text B continues to use the term ""deafness"" in a very similar medical and genetic context, describing it as a symptom of mutations in the LARS2 gene, associated with various syndromes and disorders. In both instances, ""deafness"" retains its fundamental meaning related to hearing loss, and there's no significant shift in its use or connotation over the years between the texts."
79,Deafness,"After the apparition of a sudden deafness, 45 patients (22 men and 23 women, with a mean age of 44 +/- 14.9 years) were treated with normovolaemic haemodilution performed with dextran 60. They were placed into 4 groups depending on their hearing loss: total loss: 10 cases; severe loss: 90 to 70 db. 13 cases; moderates loss: 65 to 40 db, 14 cases, slight loss: less than or equal to 35 db, 8 cases. The mean time between the onset of the hearing loss and treatment was 9.3 +/- 12.4 days. The initial mean haematocrit was 44.8 +/- 3.8% and mean haematocrit after haemodilution was 33.1 +/- 2.8%. For 51% of the patients, an almost total recovery was obtained. In 15.5% of cases, recovery was between 25 to 50% of the hearing loss, and in 33.3% of the patients recovery was negligible. We did not find any relationship between hearing recovery and initial haematocrit. The best results were obtained in the group of patients treated early. Hearing gain was significatively better if delay in starting treatment was less than 7 days. There was a relationship between the initial hearing loss and the final recuperation. These results suggested that haemodilution increased labyrinth microcirculation and oxygenation of the cochlear sensory cells, reversing the ischaemic insult to these cells.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy has been demonstrated to be extremely effective for treating genetic hearing loss over the past several years. However, successful gene therapies for hereditary deafness have not been well-studied in adult mice. To explore the possibility of gene therapy after peripheral auditory maturity, we used AAV8 to express vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (Vglut3) in the cochleae of 5w, 8w, and 20w Vglut3","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" is used to describe a condition affecting hearing capabilities. In Text A, deafness is discussed in the context of sudden onset and various degrees of hearing loss, emphasizing treatment possibilities and outcomes after such an incident. In Text B, deafness is still referred to as a hearing condition, but here the focus shifts to gene therapy as a treatment option, especially in the context of hereditary origins. Although the treatment methodologies differ across the texts—haemodilution focusing on improving microcirculation in Text A, and gene therapy targeting genetic causes in Text B—the fundamental application of the word ""deafness"" as a hearing impairment remains the same throughout the period between the two texts. Thus, the meaning has stayed consistent, indicating no significant semantic drift about how deafness is conceptualized fundamentally as a loss or impairment of hearing ability."
80,Deafness,"Cochlear implants are an accepted means for the treatment of profound bilateral deafness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining more and more importance as a diagnostic tool. It is therefore very likely that cochlear implant wearers will, at some point in their life, become MRI candidates. This makes a discussion of MRI safety of cochlear implants a most timely subject. With the C40/C40+ system as an example, all the major and potentially troublesome interactions are discussed, as well as the conditions for the safe conduct of MR examinations with cochlear implant wearers. For the C40/C40+ systems, safe MR imaging is possible with 0.2 Tesla, 1.0 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla scanners.","White spotting phenotypes in horses are highly valued in some breeds. They are quite variable and may range from the common white markings up to completely white horses. EDNRB, KIT, MITF, PAX3 and TRPM1 represent known candidate genes for white spotting phenotypes in horses. For the present study, we investigated an American Paint Horse family segregating a phenotype involving white spotting and blue eyes. Six of eight horses with the white-spotting phenotype were deaf. We obtained whole-genome sequence data from an affected horse and specifically searched for structural variants in the known candidate genes. This analysis revealed a heterozygous ~63-kb deletion spanning exons 6-9 of the MITF gene (chr16:21 503 211-21 566 617). We confirmed the breakpoints of the deletion by PCR and Sanger sequencing. PCR-based genotyping revealed that all eight available affected horses from the family carried the deletion. The finding of an MITF variant fits well with the syndromic phenotype involving both depigmentation and an increased risk for deafness and corresponds to human Waardenburg syndrome type 2A. Our findings will enable more precise genetic testing for depigmentation phenotypes in horses.","- Label: Unchanged

81,Deafness,"Data on patients with Meniere's disease, vestibular schwannoma, traumatic vertigo, sudden deafness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or vestibular neuritis were retrieved from the database of otoneurologic expert system ONE for the development and testing of a genetic algorithm (GA). The accuracy of the diagnostic rules in solving the test cases was 81%, 91%, 92%, 95%, 96%, and 98% for the respective diseases. The best rules retrieved from the GA were described by a set of questions with the most likely answers. The most important questions concerned the duration of hearing loss and the occurrence of head injury. The validity and structure of the rules created with a GA can be analyzed in detail. For rare diseases, some other reasoning process can be used, for example, case-based reasoning.","The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, causing torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. This syndrome can be divided into idiopathic (congenital) and acquired forms. The idiopathic form is a familial disorder that can be associated with sensorineural deafness (Jervell and Lange--Nielsen syndrome, autosomal recessive) or normal hearing (Romano--Ward syndrome, autosomal dominant). The acquired form has a long QT interval caused by various drugs such as quinidine sotalol and dofetilide, also by noncardiovascular drugs such as antihistamine, antibiotics, antipsychotics and others. Also, the QT interval is prolonged by electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, central nervous system lesions, significant bradyarrhythmias, cardiac ganglionitis, mitral valve prolapse and probucol. DNA variants appearing to predispose to drug-associated acquired long QT syndrome have been reported in congenital long QT.","###Answer:
- Target word: Deafness
- Text A: In this context, the term ""deafness"" is used specifically to describe a type of hearing impairment, particularly sudden deafness, as one of several auditory and vestibular conditions being studied. The usage here is clinical and focuses on deafness as a medical condition affecting hearing.

- Text B: Here, ""deafness"" also refers to a medical condition but is specifically linked to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, a genetic disorder that leads to both cardiac issues and sensorineural deafness. The term is used to distinguish between different syndromic manifestations of long QT syndrome, where ""deafness"" is part of the syndrome's characteristics when related to the genetic form.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the word ""deafness"" refers to the loss of hearing, either as an isolated medical condition or as part of a syndromic cluster (i.e., along with cardiac symptoms in a genetic disorder). Although the contexts differ (one focusing on auditory-specific conditions and the other including it as part of a broader syndrome), the core meaning of ""deafness"" as a form of hearing loss remains consistent. There is no significant shift in its semantic field or connotations; it maintains a clinical and pathological perspective in both cases."
82,Deafness,"Fos immunoreactive (IR) staining was used to examine changes in excitatory neuronal activity in the rat inferior colliculus (IC) between normal hearing and 21 day deaf rats evoked by basal or apical monopolar cochlear electrical stimulation. The location of evoked Fos IR neurons was consistent with expected tonotopic areas. The number of Fos IR cells increased as stimulation intensity increased in both normal and 21 day deaf animals. Stimulation at 1. 5x threshold evoked fewer Fos IR cells in 21 day deafened animals compared to normal hearing animals. At 5x and above, however, significantly increased numbers of Fos IR neurons (in a larger grouping) were evoked in 21 day deafened animals compared to normal hearing animals. Another group of animals had 7 days of deafness followed by 14 days of chronic basal cochlear electrical stimulation. In this group basal monopolar stimulation at 5x evoked not only a greater number of Fos IR neurons, compared to normal hearing animals, but the location of their grouping was slightly shifted to a more dorso-lateral region in the contralateral IC, compared to the normal hearing and 21 day deaf groups. These observations indicate that both deafness and chronic electrical stimulation may alter central auditory processing.","Cochlear implants (CI) have become standard in the treatment of prelingual, postlingual and perilingual deafness and hearing loss in children. Bilateral implants are considered standard for bilaterally affected children. The benefits for speech and language development, as well as speech intelligibility brought by CI-enabled hearing are greatest if these are received as soon after diagnosis as possible. Continued improvements in preoperative diagnostics, electrode design, speech coding strategies and surgical techniques, have broadened the CI applications spectrum. Nowadays--with the exception of cochlear- and cochlear nerve aplasia--almost all malformations are manageable with CIs. New indications concern partial and unilateral deafness. Treatment with CIs requires exceptional team work. In addition to ongoing medical care of the children, the involvement of parents and relatives in the cooperation between surgeons, audiologists, teachers and specialist centers is important for successful rehabilitation.","###Answer:

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""deafness"" focuses on the physiological and neurological research aspects, specifically observing changes in neural response due to deafness induced in animals for experimental purposes. Here, deafness is discussed in terms of neural activities and neuronal response to cochlear stimulation under experimental conditions. On the other hand, Text B discusses ""deafness"" within the clinical and therapeutic context, particularly focusing on the treatment of deafness in humans using cochlear implants, the improvement in speech and language development, and the involvement of comprehensive medical and family support for rehabilitation. This text emphasizes the practical, medical, and societal facets of managing deafness. The change from a primarily experimental and physiological focus to a clinical, rehabilitative, and quality-of-life oriented approach in these texts indicates a significant semantic drift in the context and implications of ""deafness."""
83,Deafness,"We investigated the clinical features of 64 cases of sudden deafness in patients more than 60 years of age. Forty-eight cases (75%) had profound deafness, 13 moderate and three mild deafness. The audiograms of 25 cases showed a flat pattern, 13 a gradually descending curve, and 13 total deafness. In 60 cases, the unaffected ear also had hearing impairment of variable severity. Fifty-one of these 60 cases demonstrated a physiological hearing threshold shift termed presbycusis in the unaffected ear. Hearing impairment in 35 cases (55%) was cured or improved by medical treatment including steroids. But in the majority of cases, the hearing threshold level of the affected ear did not improve above that of the unaffected ear when the unaffected ear had a hearing impairment. In particular, hearing impairment in five cases with total deafness in the unaffected ear did not improve. The elderly often had various systemic complications, including nine cases of diabetes and seven of hypertension. We treated patients with diabetes using steroids under the consultation of diabetic specialists. As a result, there was no case of complications induced by steroids. We consider the effect of treatment of sudden deafness in the elderly to be best judged in various degrees of hearing impairment in the unaffected ear.","The transcriptome data of skin cells from domestic cats with brown, orange, and white coats were analyzed using a public database to investigate the possible relationship between coat color-related gene expression and squamous cell carcinoma risk, as well as the mechanism of deafness in white cats. We found that the ratio of the expression level of genes suppressing squamous cell carcinoma to that of genes promoting squamous cell carcinoma might be considerably lower than the theoretical estimation in skin cells with orange and white coats in white-spotted cat. We also found the possibility of the frequent production of KIT lacking the first exon (d1KIT) in skin cells with white coats, and d1KIT production exhibited a substantial negative correlation with the expression of SOX10, which is essential for melanocyte formation and adjustment of hearing function. Additionally, the production of d1KIT was expected to be due to the insulating activity of the feline endogenous retrovirus 1 (FERV1) LTR in the first intron of KIT by its CTCF binding sequence repeat. These results contribute to basic veterinary research to understand the relationship between cat skin coat and disease risk, as well as the underlying mechanism.","###Answer:

This medical perspective primarily views deafness as a health condition to be treated and ameliorated if possible.
- Text B: Deals with genetic research into the relationship between certain genetic expressions related to coat color in cats and deafness. This includes investigations into molecular mechanisms and gene expressions that link deafness and genetic traits, specifically in cats. It is more about understanding the genetic basis of deafness as a phenomenon potentially related to other genetic factors.

In Text B, ""deafness"" is considered in an exploratory genetic context, examining its correlation with other genetic factors in animals, delivering a genetic and evolutionary angle to the understanding of deafness. The shift from a strictly medical treatment view to a broader genetic and molecular focus suggests a change in how deafness is perceived and studied, moving from its immediate impacts on health to its underlying biological causes spanning different species, extending the context and connotations associated with the term ""deafness."""
84,Deafness,"The necessity of measuring the acuity of hearing in a reproducible way arose for the first time when the invention of Volta's pile in 1800 seemed to present the opportunity of curing deafness. For this purpose Chr. H. Wolke in Jever, Northern Germany, in 1802 devised two instruments which he called ""acumeter"". Details of these instruments were hardly known, and Wolke's publication was believed to be lost. The author has now succeeded in tracing Wolke's publication and another associated paper by J. J. A. Sprenger. Hence, the circumstances of Wolke's and Sprenger's work and details of these first acumeters are now being published together with original figures and the correct dimensions of the instruments. The acumeters had a pendulum-like hammer that would strike against a plate swinging down from varying heights that could be read in degrees of angle from a scale. One of the instruments was made of wood. It was 1.50 m high, with the pendulum raised to the maximal position 2.70 m. The other instrument of similar construction was made of metal and about half the size of the first one, with a height of 0.70 m or 1.30 m respectively. For comparison Itard's acumeter is presented which was published in 1821. It worked on the same principle, and it is likely that Itard had been inspired by Wolke's paper. The development of mechanical acumeters after Wolke's and Itard's instruments is outlined briefly.","Hearing loss is one of the most common sensorineural disorder. More than half of congenital bilateral profound deafness cases have been estimated to be attributed to genetic cause. Identification of genetic cause can provide valuable information. We developed new diagnostic strategy combining phenotype-driven candidate gene approach and targeted exome sequencing to find out the causative mutation of hearing loss. The causative mutation detection rates of this strategy were 78.1% and 54.8% in Korean multiplex families and sporadic severe to profound hearing loss families, respectively. The most frequent causative genes of Korean multiplex families were SLC26A4 and POU3F4. The other causative genes were MRNR1, WFS1, COCH, TECTA, MYO6, COL11A2, EYA4, GJB3, OTOF, STRC, MYO3A, and GJB2. The most frequent causative gene of Korean sporadic severe to profound hearing loss families was SLC26A4 followed by GJB2, CHD7, and CDH23. Based upon the results, the value of this strategy as a diagnostic tool seems to be promising. Although whole genome and exome sequencing have advanced as the development of next-generation sequencing, this new strategy could be a good screening and diagnostic tool to find the causative mutations.

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""deafness"" is discussed in a historical and mechanical context, focusing on the early attempts to measure hearing acuity and treat deafness using devices called ""acumeters."" The main focus here is on the mechanical innovation aiming to diagnose and possibly treat deafness through technical means. In contrast, Text B uses ""deafness"" within a modern biomedical and genetic framework. The focus is shifted to understanding the genetic causes of deafness through advancements in genetic testing and sequencing technologies. This change signifies a transition from mechanical and symptomatic treatment approaches to a molecular and diagnostic understanding of the roots of deafness, emphasizing genetic predispositions and mutations. Thus, the semantic drift reflects a broadened and more sophisticated conceptualization of deafness from a primarily mechanical problem to include genetically defined conditions."
85,Deafness,"Early communicative behaviors in young children can be analyzed quantitatively from recordings of interactions between the child and a known adult. Our previous work has shown that the development of such behaviors differs markedly between profoundly deaf young children 1) able to make proficient use of hearing aids or having cochlear implants and 2) unable to make proficient use of hearing aids. The former take turns mainly by vocalization, whereas the latter take turns mainly by gesture. The present study set out to examine whether these contrasts in behavior demonstrated between groups are also observable within a group of young children having cochlear implants, and to examine their development over the first year of implantation. In the 20 children with complete data at the 12-month interval, two clear factors were identified that explained 72% of the variance. These can be labeled as 1) vocal-auditory turn-taking and 2) gaze orientation. All measures of communicative behavior, other than autonomy, showed significant development over the 12 months following implantation, although the observed increase in eye contact was small. No differences could be demonstrated between children with congenital and acquired deafness. It is concluded that the technique based on video analysis is sensitive to changes in early communicative behavior in the year after implantation. Deviations from the expected pattern may indicate inappropriate processor adjustment, device malfunction, or inadequate support.","A better understanding of the neural correlates of large variability in cochlear implant (CI) patients' speech performance may allow us to find solutions to further improve CI benefits. The present study examined the mismatch negativity (MMN) and the adaptation of the late auditory evoked potential (LAEP) in 10 CI users. The speech syllable /da/ and 1-kHz tone burst were used to examine the LAEP adaptation. The amount of LAEP adaptation was calculated according to the averaged N1-P2 amplitude for the LAEPs evoked by the last 3 stimuli and the amplitude evoked by the first stimulus. For the MMN recordings, the standard stimulus (1-kHz tone) and the deviant stimulus (2-kHz tone) were presented in an oddball condition. Additionally, the deviants alone were presented in a control condition. The MMN was derived by subtracting the response to the deviants in the control condition from the oddball condition. Results showed that good CI performers displayed a more prominent LAEP adaptation than moderate-to-poor performers. Speech performance was significantly correlated to the amount of LAEP adaptation for the 1-kHz tone bursts. Good performers displayed large MMNs and moderate-to-poor performers had small or absent MMNs. The abnormal electrophysiological findings in moderate-to-poor performers suggest that long-term deafness may cause damage not only at the auditory cortical level, but also at the cognitive level.","- Label: Unchanged

86,Deafness,"We report on a patient who has been in otorhinolaryngological treatment for more than 24 years owing to recurrent infra-auricular fistulation. Early hospital admissions were due to suspected abscess-forming parotitis or lymphadenitis. As far as could be discerned, no sonographical or radiological diagnostics were conducted. Complications in the sense of meningitis or labyrinthitis were not reported. In the case of the aforementioned patient a bilateral anomaly in the area of the external auditory canal went hand in hand with the development of a bilateral genuine cholesteatoma. The auriculae were configurated normally. Corrective radical surgery was conducted on both sides, first the left, then the right side. What seems remarkable in this context is the fact that despite a over two decades old cholesteatoma there was no erosion of the osseous boundaries of the eardrum towards the labyrinth and cochlea and the osseous cover of the canalis facialis. The patient was diagnosed with a high degree loss of hearing. It was not possible to derive reproductive acoustic potentials intraoperatively, which pointed to deafness. Whether this deafness was congenital or developed in the course of time based on a growing sensory hearing loss could not be ascertained.","The article covers up-to-date state of occupational deafness problem, its importance in occupational therapy.

Neighboring supporting cells have some capacity to regenerate hair cells. However, their regenerative potential sharply declines as supporting cells undergo maturation (postnatal day 5 in mice). We recently reported that reactivation of the RNA-binding protein LIN28B restores the hair cell-regenerative potential of P5 cochlear supporting cells. Here, we identify the LIN28B target Trim71 as a novel and equally potent enhancer of supporting cell plasticity. TRIM71 is a critical regulator of stem cell behavior and cell reprogramming; however, its role in cell regeneration is poorly understood. Employing an organoid-based assay, we show that TRIM71 re-expression increases the mitotic and hair cell-forming potential of P5 cochlear supporting cells by facilitating their de-differentiation into progenitor-like cells. Our mechanistic work indicates that TRIM71's RNA-binding activity is essential for such ability, and our transcriptomic analysis identifies gene modules that are linked to TRIM71 and LIN28B-mediated supporting cell reprogramming. Furthermore, our study uncovers that the TRIM71-LIN28B target Hmga2 is essential for supporting cell self-renewal and hair cell formation.","- Label: Unchanged

89,Deafness,"Large calyceal synapses are often regarded as simple relay points, built for high-fidelity and high-frequency synaptic transmission and a minimal requirement for synaptic plasticity, but this view is oversimplified. Calyceal synapses can exhibit surprising activity-dependent developmental plasticity. Here we compare basal synaptic transmission and activity-dependent plasticity at two stereotypical calyceal synapses in the auditory pathway, the endbulb and the calyx of Held. Basal synaptic transmission was more powerful at the calyx than the endbulb synapse: the amplitude of evoked AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) was significantly greater at the calyx, as were the release probability, and the number of release sites. The quantal amplitude was smaller at the calyx, consistent with the smaller amplitude of spontaneous miniature EPSCs at this synapse. High-frequency trains of stimuli revealed that the calyx had a larger readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP), less tetanic depression and less asynchronous transmitter release. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity was assessed in congenitally deaf mutant mice (dn/dn). Previously we showed that a lack of synaptic activity in deaf mice increases synaptic strength at the endbulb of Held via presynaptic mechanisms. In contrast, we have now found that deafness does not affect synaptic transmission at the calyx synapse, as eEPSC and mEPSC amplitude, release probability, number of release sites, size of RRP, tetanic depression and asynchronous release were unchanged compared to normal mice. Synaptic transmission at the calyx synapse is more powerful and has less capacity for developmental plasticity compared to the endbulb synapse.","Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by sensorineural deafness and pigment abnormalities, and is caused by variants in the PAX3 homeodomain. PAX3 variants have been associated with severe neural tube defects in mice and humans, but the frequency and clinical manifestations of this symptom remain largely unexplored in humans. Consequently, the role of PAX3 in human neural tube formation remains a study of interest, for clinical as well as research purposes. Though the association between spina bifida and WS1 is now well-documented, no study has attempted to characterize the range of spina bifida phenotypes seen in WS. Spina bifida encompasses several diagnoses with a wide scope of clinical severity, ranging from spina bifida occulta to myelomeningocele. We present a patient with Waardenburg syndrome type 1 caused by a novel missense variant in PAX3, presenting with myelomeningocele, Arnold-Chiari malformation, and hydrocephalus at birth. Additionally, we review 32 total cases of neural tube defects associated with WS. Including this report, there have been 15 published cases of myelomeningocele, 10 cases of unspecified spina bifida, 3 cases of sacral dimples, 0 cases of meningocele, and 4 cases of miscellaneous other neural tube defects.

### Reason:
The use of the term ""deafness"" in both Text A and Text B refers consistently to the condition involving the loss of the ability to hear. In Text A, deafness is discussed in the context of its effect on synaptic transmissions within the auditory pathways of mice, specifically exploring how the condition influences synaptic strength and transmission at neural synapses related to hearing. Text B also directly addresses deafness as a sensorineural condition, within the genetic framework of Waardenburg syndrome, highlighting its phenotypic manifestation associated with auditory impairment.

Despite the different contexts—the first being a neuroscientific exploration in mice, and the second a genetic study in humans—the underlying understanding and reference to ""deafness"" as a condition affecting hearing remains stable. Both texts treat deafness primarily as an auditory deficit without diverging into metaphoric or significantly altered new meanings. Therefore, the semantic core concerning the physiological inability to hear stays unchanged, demonstrating no semantic drift for the term ""deafness"" between the two periods covered by the texts."
90,Deafness,Acute hearing loss following non-otologic surgery and general anesthesia is a rare occurrence. Deafness following anesthesia has more commonly been associated with spinal anesthesia or cardiopulmonary bypass surgical procedures. We present a case with unilateral cochlear dysfunction and sensorineural hearing loss after inguinal hernia operation. The literature is reviewed and the mechanisms causing hearing loss during anesthesia are discussed.,"Patients with the rare genetic disorders, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome (CS) have defects in DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER). The NER pathway involves at least 28 genes. Three NER genes are also part of the basal transcription factor, TFIIH. Mutations in 11 NER genes have been associated with clinical diseases with at least eight overlapping phenotypes. The clinical features of these patients have some similarities but also have marked differences. NER is involved in protection against sunlight-induced DNA damage. While XP patients have 1000-fold increase in susceptibility to skin cancer, TTD and CS patients have normal skin cancer risk. Several of the genes involved in NER also affect somatic growth and development. Some patients have short stature and immature sexual development. TTD patients have sulfur deficient brittle hair. Progressive sensorineural deafness is an early feature of XP and CS. Many of these clinical diseases are associated with developmental delay and progressive neurological degeneration. The main neuropathology of XP is a primary neuronal degeneration. In contrast, CS and TTD patients have reduced myelination of the brain. These complex neurological abnormalities are not related to sunlight exposure but may be caused by developmental defects as well as faulty repair of DNA damage to neuronal cells induced by oxidative metabolism or other endogenous processes.","- Label: Changed

Conversely, in Text B, ""deafness"" is described as a symptom of a complex genetic disorder affecting multiple systems, including the neurological system, where it is detailed as a progressive sensorineural condition. This shift in context from a post-surgical complication to a genetic and progressive neurological symptom indicates a broader and more integrated understanding of the causes and implications of deafness, around the notion of genetic diseases and their systemic effects, not just limited to auditory symptoms but linked to neurological conditions.

However, when the subjects were divided into Skilled and Less Skilled groups, based on their performance in the visual condition of each test, it was found that the performance of the Skilled subjects deteriorated while that of the Less Skilled subjects improved when tactile information was provided in two conditions (word-discrimination and word-decoding conditions). It was concluded that tactile information interferes with Skilled subjects' automaticity of these functions. Furthermore, intercorrelations between discrimination and decoding tasks suggest that there are similarities between visually and tactilely supported speechreading in how they relate to sentence-based speechreading. Clinical implications of the results were discussed.","More than 100 genes have been associated with deafness. However, SMAD4 is rarely considered a contributor to deafness in humans, except for its well-defined role in cell differentiation and regeneration. Here, we report that a SMAD4 defect in mice can cause auditory neuropathy, which was defined as a mysterious hearing and speech perception disorder in human for which the genetic background remains unclear. Our study showed that a SMAD4 defect induces failed formation of cochlear ribbon synapse during the earlier stage of auditory development in mice. Further investigation found that there are nearly normal morphology of outer hair cells (OHCs) and post-synapse spiral ganglion nerves (SGNs) in SMAD4 conditional knockout mice (cKO); however, a preserved distortion product of otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and cochlear microphonic (CM) still can be evoked in cKO mice. Moreover, a partial restoration of hearing detected by electric auditory brainstem response (eABR) has been obtained in the cKO mice using electrode stimuli toward auditory nerves. Additionally, the ribbon synapses in retina are not affected by this SMAD4 defect. Thus, our findings suggest that this SMAD4 defect causes auditory neuropathy via specialized disruption of cochlear ribbon synapses.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""deafness"" is used to describe the condition of impaired hearing ability, although the contexts surrounding its mention vary. Text A discusses the application of vibrotactile support in individuals with acquired deafness, focusing on the impact of tactile information on speech perception abilities. Text B delves into the genetic factors contributing to deafness, specifically mentioning a study about a genetic defect in mice that leads to auditory neuropathy, a specific type of hearing impairment. Despite these different approaches and aspects of research being highlighted—treatment and support in Text A versus genetic causes and molecular biology in Text B—the fundamental meaning of the word ""deafness"" as a hearing impairment remains consistent across both texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning of the word ""deafness"" between the two different time periods and scientific focuses."
92,Deafness,"An epidemiologic study of hearing loss was undertaken on a small Caribbean island and revealed a high frequency of abnormal audiograms among the population of French origin. Since there is no clear-cut discrimination between hypoacusis and normal hearing, but rather a continuous spectrum, the degree of hearing loss was quantified by an audiometric index, using the results of audiograms performed on 70% of the inhabitants. No environmental factors could be identified, although the effect of such factors is highly suggested by several observations of deafness aggravated by, or appearing after, a small dose of ototoxic antibiotics, and also by a strong residual age effect after correction for physiological presbyacusis. Hearing loss was found to be sparsed all over the island. Familial aggregation was noticed for several severe cases.","The gene AK2 encodes the phosphotransferase adenylate kinase 2 (AK2).

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers to a condition of impaired ability to hear. Text A discusses deafness in the context of epidemiologic study and its possible aggravation by environmental factors such as ototoxic antibiotics. Text B discusses deafness as a symptom of a genetic condition—reticular dysgenesis—caused by mutations in the gene AK2.

Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the use of ""deafness"" between the two time periods based on these excerpts."
93,Deafness,"Six patients with both choanal atresia (ChA) and additional malformations are described and another 110 cases with this combination reviewed from the literature. Our study of these cases supports the existence of the CHARGE-association (Coloboma, Heart Disease, Atresia of choanae, Retarded mental development and growth, Genital hypoplasia, Ear anomalies and deafness). Our findings suggest the inclusion of orofacial clefts and oesophageal atresia among the main symptoms of this association. A certain degree of facial dysmorphism (low set, dysplastic ears, retrogenia, antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures and anteverted nares) was observed in each of our cases. Infants with the bilateral type of ChA plus cardiac defects and those with ChA plus renal malformations have a high mortality rate. The aetiology of the association is not clear. The recurrence risk may be low.","Single-sided deafness patients are now being considered candidates to receive a cochlear implant. With this, many people who have undergone a unilateral vestibular labyrinthectomy for the treatment of chronic vertigo are now being considered for cochlear implantation. There is still some concern regarding the potential efficacy of cochlear implants in these patients, where factors such as cochlear fibrosis or nerve degeneration following unilateral vestibular labyrinthectomy may preclude their use. Here, we have performed a unilateral vestibular labyrinthectomy in normally hearing guinea pigs, and allowed them to recover for either 6 weeks, or 10 months, before assessing morphological and functional changes related to cochlear implantation. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy was used to assess gross morphology throughout the entire ear. Whole nerve responses to acoustic, vibrational, or electrical stimuli were used as functional measures. Mild cellular infiltration was observed at 6 weeks, and to a lesser extent at 10 months after labyrinthectomy. Following labyrinthectomy, cochlear sensitivity to high-frequency acoustic tone-bursts was reduced by 16 ± 4 dB, vestibular sensitivity was almost entirely abolished, and electrical sensitivity was only mildly reduced. These results support recent clinical findings that patients who have received a vestibular labyrinthectomy may still benefit from a cochlear implant.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A from an earlier period, the focus on the word ""deafness"" is heavily associated with genetic and developmental disorders as part of a broader syndrome (CHARGE association). The consideration of deafness here is primarily in context of a multi-faceted congenital condition, emphasizing the presentation as a symptom among other physical and developmental anomalies.

  In Text B from a more recent year, the term ""deafness"" specifically addresses ""single-sided deafness"" in a clinical and treatment-oriented context. The emphasis is on therapeutic advancements (cochlear implants) and their feasibility in patients who have undergone specific procedures like unilateral vestibular labyrinthectomy. Thus, the use of the word ""deafness"" has shifted more towards a focus on management and rehabilitation opportunities for the condition, rather than solely its occurrence as part of a broader syndromic condition.

  This shift in the use of ""deafness"" from an inherent part of a syndromic diagnosis towards an individual, treatable condition represents a significant semantic drift in context and implications across the two time periods."
94,Deafness,"Endolymphatic hydrops is the hystopathological substrate characteristic of Ménière's disease. Besides the classical treatment with diuretics and/or osmotic drugs for some time, now treatment in a ""pressure chamber"" (OTI) has also been applied. The oxygen administered in the hyperbaric chamber can reduce the hydrops both by increasing the hydrostatic pressure and by mechanically stimulating the flow of endolymph toward the duct and endolymphatic sac. In addition, an increase is seen in the amount of O2 dissolved in the labyrinthine fluids and this contributes to recovering cell metabolism and restoring normal cochlear electrophysiological functions. Between 1992 and 1996 40 patients with monolateral Ménière's disease were studied: 15 underwent oxygen therapy at a constant pressure (2.2 ATA) (HOT), 25 with a continuous variation in pressure (from 1.7 to 2.2 ATA) (Alternobaric therapy, AOT). During the acute phase the patients underwent daily OTI treatment for 15 days in a row. The maintenance treatment called for one treatment cycle (one session a day for 5 days in a row) a month for 1 year, followed by for one treatment cycle (one session a day for 5 days in a row) every three months during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th years. The controls consisted of a group of 18 patients treated with 10% glycerol i.v. (during the acute phase) and betahystine (8 mg x 3/die) between episodes. A comparison was made of the average hearing threshold for the frequencies 500-3000 Hz (PTA), how frequently episodes of dizziness arose and extent of hearing loss in the three groups after the initial 15 days of treatment and at the end of the 4-year follow-up, in compliance with the criteria laid down by the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium in 1995. At the end of the first 15 days of treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the three groups. At the end of the follow-up, on the other hand, hyperbaric treatment, and in particular alternobaric therapy, enabled a significant reduction in the episodes of dizziness as compared to the control group. PTA and deafness also improved significantly in the patients who had undergone hyperbaric treatment. The results of the present work show that HOT, and in particular AOT, offer a valid alternative to drugs in the treatment of Ménière's disease.","This article ethnographically examines how some deaf people in urban India have begun to orient themselves toward the future by participating in multilevel marketing businesses.

- Reason: The usage and connotation of the word ""deafness"" have undergone a significant semantic drift between the two texts. In Text A from 1996, ""deafness"" is discussed strictly in medical terms, focusing on treatment methods to mitigate hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease using medical therapies. The word ""deafness"" here directly refers to the loss of hearing. In contrast, Text B from a later period adopts a socio-cultural and anthropological perspective, discussing ""deafness"" within the context of social identity, economic opportunities, and cultural development among deaf individuals. It transcends the medical definition and incorporates elements of community building and empowerment, indicating a shift from purely pathological interpretations to broader socio-cultural implications. The semantic content of ""deafness"" in Text B is more expansive, reflecting changes in societal attitudes towards disability and inclusion."
95,Deafness,"Familial cases of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, deafness, generalized weakness, and hypogonadism were studied. A muscle biopsy specimen showed increased amounts of glycogen particles, lipid droplets, and mitochondria that frequently contained paracrystalline inclusion bodies between intramitochondrial and extramitochondrial membranes. Involvement of the CNS was suspected from a computed tomography scan that revealed diffuse, low-density deep cerebral white matter. Therapy with corticosteroids (prednisolone) was effective for recovery of muscular strength in the extremities. Possible involvement of the CNS in ophthalmoplegia-plus might be related to an abnormal metabolism of mitochondria.","Introduction Otosclerosis is a disease that causes bone resorption and deposition in the auditory structures, leading to deafness. Many studies have evaluated the histopathology of the stapes footplate in this disease (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, vascular proliferation, fibroblasts, and histiocytes), but we found no studies in the literature involving the histology of the superstructure of the stapes. Objectives To perform an analysis under optical microscopy of histopathologic findings of the superstructure of the stapes from patients with otosclerosis. Methods A contemporary cross-sectional cohort study of pathology analysis of superstructures of the stapes of patients with otosclerosis. Results Fifteen superstructures of stapes in patients with otosclerosis operated in our service and four stapes of cadavers used for dissection (controls) were evaluated. No areas of bone resorption or deposition or presence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the superstructure of the stapes were found. However, we found in the more distal portions of the crura areas with prominent cementitious lines and woven bone, which was different than the mature trabecular bone found in the head of the stapes or in the controls. Conclusion There were histologic changes in the superstructure of the stapes in patients with otosclerosis operated in our service. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" is used to refer to the loss of hearing. Text A discusses deafness in the context of a syndrome that includes multiple symptoms (ophthalmoplegia, generalized weakness, hypogonadism, and deafness), while Text B focuses specifically on deafness as a consequence of otosclerosis, affecting the auditory structures. In both cases, deafness clearly refers to the condition of lacking the ability to hear. Therefore, the fundamental meaning and usage of the word ""deafness"" remain consistent between these two texts from different time periods, indicating there is no significant semantic drift with respect to the meaning of ""deafness."""
96,Deafness,Four cases with Paget's disease of the temporal bone are presented to illustrate the pathogenesis of the associated deafness. One case illustrates the combination of severe deafness due to bilateral otosclerosis with probably asymptomatic bilateral Paget's disease. One case with advanced Paget's disease presents features to explain early stages of sensori-neural deafness before actual cellular invasion of the inner ear. One case of profound deafness due to Paget's disease presents a different stage of cellular invasion of the inner ear by the disease on each side. One case illustrates invasion of the internal auditory meatus by Paget's disease with infiltration of the acoustic division of the nerve and profound deafness.,"Despite early bilateral cochlear implantation, children with congenital deafness do not develop accurate spatial hearing; we thus asked whether auditory brain networks are disrupted in these children. EEG responses were evoked unilaterally and bilaterally in 13 children with normal hearing and 16 children receiving bilateral cochlear implants simultaneously. Active cortical areas were estimated by the Time Restricted Artifact and Coherent source Suppression (TRACS) beamformer and connected cortical areas were identified by measuring coherence between source responses. A whole-brain analysis of theta band coherence revealed the strongest connections between the temporal areas in all conditions at early latencies. Stronger imaginary coherence in activity between the two auditory cortices to bilateral than unilateral input was found in children with normal hearing reflecting facilitation in the auditory network during bilateral hearing. The opposite effect, depressed coherence, was found during bilateral stimulation in children using cochlear implants. Children with cochlear implants also showed a unique auditory network in response to bilateral stimulation which was marked by increased connectivity between occipital and frontal areas. These findings suggest that cortical networks for sound processing are normally facilitated by bilateral input but are disrupted in children who hear through two independent cochlear implants. Efforts to improve hearing in children with congenital deafness must thus include corrections to potential mismatches in bilateral input to support brain development.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The term ""deafness"" in both Text A and Text B refers consistently to the loss of hearing. In Text A, the focus is on the specific causes and progression of deafness due to diseases like Paget's disease affecting the inner ear structures. The usage highlights the pathogenesis and different stages of impairment of hearing.

In Text B, deafness is discussed in the context of children with congenital deafness using cochlear implants and the impact on their auditory brain networks. Despite the introduction of modern medical interventions (cochlear implants), the primary context of ""deafness"" as a significant reduction or loss of hearing ability remains the same.

Overall, although the two texts discuss ""deafness"" in differing medical contexts and studies (pathogenesis in Paget's disease vs. brain network adaptation in cochlear implant users), the fundamental meaning of the term as a hearing impairment does not show a significant semantic drift. The core definition and perception of deafness as a condition involving compromised hearing capabilities are consistent between the two periods."
97,Deafness,"The ENT problems following the Birmingham bombings of 1974 are presented. It is during the positive phase of bomb blast that the tympanic membrane ruptures. Spalling is a likely explanation for the mechanism of rupture of the tympanic membrane specially in large perforations. Tympanic membrane defects involving 80 per cent of the surface area of the drumhead or more persisted, whereas those involving less than 80 per cent healed with conservative treatment. The majority of perforations (81.4 per cent) healed spontaneously, with a three-layered membrane. A month should be allowed for the healing of every 10 per cent loss of the surface area of the drumhead. During surgical repair of persistent perforations, the malleus handle was found to be on a deeper plain than the long process of the incus. Tympanic membrane perforations did not protect the inner ear, the sensorineural deafness producing either a high tone or a flat loss.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""deafness"" refers primarily to the loss of hearing. In Text A, ""deafness"" is discussed in the context of injuries resulting from a bomb blast, highlighting how such trauma can lead to temporary or permanent hearing loss. In Text B, ""deafness"" is discussed as part of a set of symptoms experienced by a young boy with multiple developmental and physical challenges, with an emphasis on his condition being sensorineural (relating to the nerves or sensory organs involved in hearing). Although the contexts and additional medical conditions associated vary, the fundamental meaning of the term 'deafness'—referring to significant hearing impairment—remains the same in both texts. Therefore, the semantic meaning of ""deafness"" has not drifted between the texts from two different periods and remains focused on hearing loss."
98,Deafness,"Continuous loud noice was used to mask auditory feedback from vocal behavior of male canaries. Single unit techniques demonstrate partial deafness after noise exposure. Longer exposure caused greater deficits, with losses of high-frequency sensitivity. Males raised in noise to 40 days of age, then deafened surgically, thus totally deprived of auditory feedback from vocalization, developed significantly fewer song syllables than birds similarly raised but left intact, to mature in quiet sound-insulated chambers. Males left longer in noise, to sexual maturity at 200 days of age, sang at first like surgically deafend birds, but then increased their song syllable repertoire after noise termination. Thus, in spite of the considerable deafness resulting from noise exposure, the deficit in syllable repertoire was corrected, presumably as a result of restoration of the birds' ability to hear their own song.","  A question in the realm of deepfakes is slowly emerging pertaining to whether

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""deafness"" is used in a biological and medical context, referring specifically to the partial or total loss of the ability to hear due to noise exposure or surgical interventions in canaries as part of scientific experiments. It primarily deals with an impairment or a condition affecting hearing. In this case, deafness is regarded as a direct consequence of auditory interference or modification.

In Text B, however, ""deafness"" appears in a social technology and communication context, particularly relating to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHoH) community. Here, the focus is on using advanced technology (deepfake) to benefit the community by generating sign language videos, which shows a shift from viewing deafness purely as a medical condition to recognizing it as part of a broader societal and technological interaction. The mention of ""deafness"" is embedded in discussions about inclusivity, accessibility, and technological innovation for better communication aids for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, showing a more integrated, identity-focused understanding of the condition.

The semantic drift from a strictly medical or biological impairment towards a broader social and technological context indicates a significant shift in the meaning and connotation of the word ""deafness"" over time."
99,Deafness,"In an effort to understand the impact of their children's deafness on Greek mothers, demographic, disability-related and stress characteristics were examined with 42 hearing mothers and their deaf children. The work was based on Hill's ABCX model and Bronfenbrenner's social ecology model, entailing a microsystem, mesosystem, ecosystem, and macrosystem. In addition to child history obtained from school records, Rotter's locus of control scale, Coopersmith's self-esteem inventory and the Clarke questionnaire on resources and stress were given to mothers. Onset of deafness before 18 months of age was associated with greater maternal stress. A tendency for mothers of younger children to report more stress was evident. The mothers mainly had an external locus of control, attributing events to outside agents beyond their control. Self-esteem proved the best predictor of stress, with a low-esteem associated with greater reported stress. The findings are discussed with reference to disability-related and cultural factors.","Although the basic principles underlying the function of the peripheral auditory system have been known for many years, the molecules required for hearing have hitherto remained elusive. Genetic approaches have recently provided unparalleled molecular insight into how the hair bundle, the hair cell's mechanosensory organelle, forms and functions. We discuss how the proteins encoded by the Usher syndrome type 1 genes form molecular complexes required for hair-bundle development and for gating the mechanotransducer channel. We show how mouse models for nonsyndromic forms of deafness involving genes encoding Triobp and stereocilin reveal, respectively, the way stereocilia rootlets contribute to the hair bundle's mechanical properties and how the hair bundle produces suppressive masking, a property that contributes to speech intelligibility. Finally, we examine how mutations in the genes encoding α- and β-tectorin reveal multiple roles for the tectorial membrane, an extracellular matrix unique to the cochlea, in stimulating hair bundles.","### Answer:

1,Hearing loss,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC, or Sanfilippo syndrome C) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of acetyl-coenzyme A:alpha-glucosaminide-N-acetyltransferase. Patients develop progressive neuropsychiatric problems, mental retardation, hearing loss, and relatively minor visceral manifestations. The pattern of transmission is consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The aim of this study was to find a locus for MPS IIIC using a homozygosity mapping approach. A genomewide scan was performed on DNA from 27 affected individuals and 17 of their unaffected relatives. Additional patients were recruited, and DNA was obtained from a total of 44 affected individuals and 18 unaffected family members from 31 families from 10 countries. A working candidate interval was defined by looking for excess homozygosity in patients compared with their relatives. Additional markers were genotyped in regions of interest. Linkage analysis was performed to support the informal analysis. Inspection of the genomewide scan data showed apparent excess homozygosity in patients compared with their relatives for markers on chromosome 8. Additional genotyping identified 15 consecutive markers (from D8S1051 to D8S2332) in an 8.3 cM interval for which the genotypes of affected siblings were identical in state.

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""hearing loss"" is discussed in the context of a medical condition directly linked with the use of a specific drug (propylthiouracil) and an autoimmune response, specifically affecting the sensorineural component and associated with small-vessel vasculitis in the inner ear. The focus is on the pathophysiological processes at the periphery (ear itself and its immediate vasculature) leading to hearing impairment.

In Text B, ""hearing loss"" is treated in a broader scientific inquiry primarily concerned with the effects on the central nervous system and cognitive functions in rats. Here, the emphasis shifts from peripheral causation and specifics of auditory mechanism disruption to an examination of cognitive and central neural alterations caused by auditory deficits, which represents a shift from a strictly medical or clinical perspective to a broader neurobiological and cognitive framework.

The semantic drift is evident as the term extends from a specific clinical description of a type of hearing loss associated with certain medical conditions to a more general exploration of the neurological and cognitive impairments associated with auditory sensory deprivation. This signifies a change in focus from the specific medical factors leading to hearing loss to the broader consequences of hearing loss on neural and cognitive functions."

The immediate effect of reduction was significantly different between the primary BPPV group and the group with SSNHL and BPPV for both psc-BPPV and hsc-BPPV (P < .05), and the effect of the primary BPPV group was better, but it was no difference for msc-BPPV (P > .05). For the treatment of BPPV accompanied by SSNHL within 1 week of onset, the additional reduction therapy showed no benefit, so we need to apply medication for SSNHL.

- Reason: In both texts, the term ""hearing loss"" refers clearly to a medical condition affecting auditory capabilities and necessitates treatment or intervention. Text A discusses unilateral cochlear hearing loss as a risk factor affecting development and emphasizes the need for early diagnosis. Text B handles hearing loss (specifically SSNHL) in a clinical setting with details on treatment practices. Both instances address ""hearing loss"" in the context of its impact on health and its treatment, showing no significant drift in the medical and contextual meaning of the term between the two periods."
4,Hearing loss,"Some health authorities in the UK are discontinuing hearing screening at school entry, mainly because the pure tone sweep test is under-specific (i.e. fails too many children) and thus leads to unnecessary and costly, but unproductive, follow-up assessment. A screening method with different properties such as a questionnaire could be a more cost-effective method of mass screening children. The MRC Institute of Hearing Research has developed and evaluated through several stages such a screening questionnaire (the Childhood Middle Ear Disease and Hearing Questionnaire (CMEDHQ), containing 11 scored questions under two broad headings: history and presentation of the disease, and consultation/treatment history. In a service-based evaluation, 2860 mainstream reception-year school children from two consecutive years, attending schools in south west Cumbria in the North-West Regional Health Authority received the sweep test and the CMEDHQ. (Although predominantly designed to detect middle ear problems, the questionnaire also has some potential to detect permanent hearing loss; thus providing a useful backstop for detection of permanent losses either missed or not present in earlier infancy.) The screening CMEDHQ obtained a very high response rate (90%). Follow-up included 235 control cases as well as all pure tone sweep test failures. Analysis, by use of a definition of cases conservative with respect to the sensitivity of the questionnaire, showed that the CMEDHQ has better specificity, but slightly lower sensitivity, than the pure tone sweep test for composite system decision (where 'case' = treated at ENT; 'non-case' = pass at whatever stage was reached before discharge). Follow-up indicated that the limited method available for assessing sensitivity might give an over-favourable view of the pure tone sweep test. Possible improvement of questionnaire sensitivity by further refinements is under examination. The findings show that it is worth conducting a fully parallel multi-district cost-effectiveness comparison of the pure tone sweep test versus the CMEDHQ.","Listening to speech is often demanding because of signal degradations and the presence of distracting sounds (i.e., ""noise""). The question how the brain achieves the task of extracting only relevant information from the mixture of sounds reaching the ear (i.e., ""cocktail party problem"") is still open. In analogy to recent findings in vision, we propose cortical alpha (~10 Hz) oscillations measurable using M/EEG as a pivotal mechanism to selectively inhibit the processing of noise to improve auditory selective attention to task-relevant signals. We review initial evidence of enhanced alpha activity in selective listening tasks, suggesting a significant role of alpha-modulated noise suppression in speech. We discuss the importance of dissociating between noise interference in the auditory periphery (i.e., energetic masking) and noise interference with more central cognitive aspects of speech processing (i.e., informational masking). Finally, we point out the adverse effects of age-related hearing loss and/or cognitive decline on auditory selective inhibition. With this perspective article, we set the stage for future studies on the inhibitory role of alpha oscillations for speech processing in challenging listening situations. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" is used in the context of auditory impairments - albeit in different settings and phases of detection/treatment. Text A deals with the early detection and screening methods for hearing issues among children, emphasizing the effectiveness of a questionnaire approach compared to the pure tone sweep test, which also aims to uncover permanent hearing losses. Meanwhile, Text B focuses on the broader challenges related to auditory processing, specifically in noisy environments, and also highlights the impact of age-related hearing loss on auditory selective attention. In both cases, ""hearing loss"" refers to a reduction or decline in the ability to hear and understand auditory signals, maintaining a consistent biomedical and health-related context across both texts. Therefore, the semantic meaning of the term remains focused on auditory deficiency without shifting in connotation or specific usage."
5,Hearing loss,"Selective chemical ablation of the vestibular endorgan using intratympanic gentamicin is an effective and safe treatment for incapacitating vertigo in patients with unilateral Menière's disease. A major risk of the treatment is sensorineural hearing loss. In this retrospective study, two different regimens of intratympanic gentamicin therapy are compared. In one group, multiple daily doses were administered in hospital over 4 consecutive days. The other group received single treatments at weekly intervals on an outpatient basis, following pretreatment audiometric and clinical assessment. We adopted the weekly protocol to theoretically reduce the incidence of treatment-related hearing loss by a more controlled titration of dosing. Preliminary results indicate that the weekly interval treatment offers equivalent efficacy with considerably less risk to hearing.","Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune endotheliopathy involving the brain, retina, and inner ear. Olfactory dysfunction is a common early manifestation of several central nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune-mediated diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. While the literature is abundant about the Susac syndrome classic triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, and low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, little is known about the extent of olfactory sense involvement.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" primarily refers to impairment or reduction in the ability to hear, specifically characterized as ""sensorineural"" in relation to specific syndromes or health conditions. Text A discusses ""sensorineural hearing loss"" as a risk associated with a treatment for Menière's disease, and Text B highlights ""low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss"" as a symptom of Susac syndrome. In both texts, the term is used in a medical context to describe a similar type of auditory impairment linked to distinct health issues. This shows that the meaning of ""hearing loss"" has not significantly drifted but remains consistent in describing a specific medical condition between the two timeframes."
6,Hearing loss,"Twenty-four patients with acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss (ALHL) were examined using electrocochleography. The negative summating potential (SP) amplitude and the summating potential/action potential (AP) ratio were significantly greater in the ALHL patients than in normals. The SP/AP ratio was smaller in the ALHL patients than in patients with known Meniere's disease and moderate hearing loss, although the SP amplitude was somewhat greater in the former. An abnormal increase in the SP amplitude following click stimuli was found in 54% of the ALHL patients, while the SP/AP ratio was increased abnormally in 63% of these patients. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of ALHL may be similar to that for endolymphatic hydrops.","Tinnitus has been suggested to arise from neuronal hyperactivity in auditory areas of the brain, and anti-epileptic drugs are sometimes used to provide relief from tinnitus. Recently, the anti-epileptic properties of the cannabinoid drugs have gained increasing interest; however, the use of cannabinoids as a form of treatment for tinnitus is controversial. In this study, we tested whether a combination of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), delivered in a 1:1 ratio, could affect tinnitus perception in a rat model of acoustic trauma-induced tinnitus. Following sham treatment or acoustic trauma, the animals were divided into the following groups: (1) sham (i.e., no acoustic trauma) with vehicle treatment; (2) sham with drug treatment (i.e., delta-9-THC + CBD); (3) acoustic trauma-exposed exhibiting tinnitus, with drug treatment; and (4) acoustic trauma-exposed exhibiting no tinnitus, with drug treatment. The animals received either the vehicle or the cannabinoid drugs every day, 30 min before the tinnitus behavioral testing. Acoustic trauma caused a significant increase in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds in the exposed animals, indicating hearing loss; however, there was a partial recovery over 6 months. Acoustic trauma did not always result in tinnitus; however, among those that did exhibit tinnitus, some of them had tinnitus at multiple frequencies while others had it only at a single frequency. The cannabinoids significantly increased the number of tinnitus animals in the exposed-tinnitus group, but not in the sham group. The results suggest that cannabinoids may promote the development of tinnitus, especially when there is pre-existing hearing damage. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The main focus around the target word ""hearing loss"" in both Text A and Text B revolves around auditory impairments and their implications or associated conditions. Text A discusses acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss and provides specific details about electrocochleography findings, suggesting that the hearing loss might be similar to that found in conditions like endolymphatic hydrops. Here, ""hearing loss"" is clearly framed within a medical and physiological context referring to an impairment in the auditory system.

In Text B, the discussion expands into the consequences of acoustic trauma, another factor leading to ""hearing loss,"" in an experimental setup using rats. This text investigates the effects of cannabinoids on tinnitus perception in rats with induced acoustic trauma, which also increased auditory brainstem response thresholds, a marker of hearing loss. Although Text B introduces elements of pharmacological treatments and experimental models, the fundamental usage of ""hearing loss"" remains tied to its medical and clinical connotation as an auditory impairment.

Comparing both instances, the semantic usage of ""hearing loss"" has not drifted significantly between the two texts. The contexts vary with further implications studied in Text B (effects of drugs, experimental treatments), yet the core meaning pertaining to auditory deficits remains static. Thus, the term's semantic meaning remains unchanged between the texts."
7,Hearing loss,"Twelve adults with unilateral hearing losses were tested to determine interaural attenuation for spondaic words. Low-pass and band-pass filters were used to simulate hearing loss at the normal ear. Results suggest that in deciding on the possibility of cross hearing, the spondee threshold at the test ear should be compared to the most sensitive bone-conduction threshold at the nontest ear, excluding .25 kc/s.",The large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+ )channels (BK) expression is decreased in the cochleae of age-related hearing loss (AHL) mice. BK channel may be associated with AHL.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" refers to the reduction or impairment in the ability to hear. Text A discusses methodologies related to understanding the extent of unilateral hearing loss in adults, focusing on experimental procedures and auditory testing. Text B, while discussing the molecular and biological aspects, links the expression of specific channels in the cochlea to age-related hearing loss. Despite a shift from a practical auditory test evaluation in Text A to a molecular bio-explanation in Text B, the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as an impairment in hearing remains stable without semantic drift."
8,Hearing loss,"A 37-year-old man with juvenile and refractory hypertension was admitted to our hospital for progressive left hearing loss, vertigo, and dizziness. Neurological examination revealed left hearing loss and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and vestibular dysfunction. MRI and cerebral angiography disclosed megadolichobasilar artery (MDBA). Moreover, modified MR cisternography at the medulla disclosed marked compression and deformity of the left rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) by the dolichoectatic right vertebral artery. In the literatures, bulbovascular compression has been reported in 4 among 9 patients with MDBA (including the present patient), for whom MRI of the medulla was presented. All 4 patients suffered from hypertension, and at least 3 of them showed juvenile and refractory hypertension. Ipsilateral pyramidal tract disturbance (Opalski syndrome) was observed in 3 patients. Considering the recent concept that the cardiovascular center can be localized at the RVLM, juvenile and refractory hypertension, and possibly Opalski syndrome in the present patient can be attributed to bulbovascular compression by MDBA. In the patients with MDBA and hypertension or Opalski syndrome, MR cisternography of the medulla is warranted to evaluate compression by MDBA.",The aims of this study were to clarify the clinical value of the bony cochlear nerve canal (BCNC) and internal auditory canal (IAC) in children with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (b-SNHL) and to reveal the correlation between these parameters and outcomes after cochlear implantation (CI).,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" retains a closely similar medical and clinical connotation related to diminished auditory capability. In Text A, ""hearing loss"" is discussed in the context of a medical case involving neurological and anatomical factors, while in Text B, the term pertains to pediatric cases analyzed for cochlear structural assessments and interventions via cochlear implants. Despite different specific medical scenarios and details, the fundamental usage and meaning concerning an auditory condition remain the same. There is no significant semantic drift in how the term ""hearing loss"" is understood between the two texts, which focus on diagnosis, consequences, and interventions related to impaired hearing functions."
9,Hearing loss,"Clinicians have been aware of the problem of post-stapedectomy perilymph fistulas for some time. The existence of non-surgical oval and round window fistulas has been known and was first described in detail by Fee in 1968. This paper concerns a small series of patients with spontaneous and traumatic perilymph fistulas. Five oval window fistulas and one round window fistula are reported. Clinical features, audiometric, radiographic and vestibular findings are discussed. The etiology of traumatic and spontaneous fistulas is not well understood, but seems to bear a relationship to sudden increased in intracranial pressure transmitted to the inner ear through the cochlear aqueduct. Middle ear pressure changes, as seen in acoustic or barotrauma, may also cause these leaks. Indications for surgery and techniques of perilymph fistula identification and repair are discussed in the paper. Surgical correction led to relief of vertigo in 80 percent of patients in this series, and significant hearing improvements were seen in 50 percent of the patients. In evaluating patients with sudden sensori-neural hearing loss, or persistent vestibular symptoms following head or ear trauma, the otologist should keep in mind the possibility of a perilymph fistula and actively investigate these patients. Evidence presented in this paper and in the literature suggest that identification and correction of spontaneous and traumatic perilymph fistulas can lead to resolution of vestibular symptoms and improved hearing in a significant number of patients with these lesions.","A universal programme of newborn/early hearing screening was introduced fifteen years ago in the northern part of Belgium (Flanders) by the Government Health Service 'Kind en Gezin' (Child and Family). Since then, large numbers of hearing-impaired babies have been fitted with conventional hearing aids at a very young age, mostly before the age of 2-3 months. As a result of the early hearing screening programme, the decision to proceed with a cochlear implant is now taken much earlier. Fitting hearing aids in very young children is always part of a continuous diagnostics approach based on cross-checks and a combination of objective and subjective audiometry. It is also a component of a multidisciplinary approach, with parents as the essential party. Fitting hearing aids in very young children cannot be separated from this approach. This article therefore stresses the positive evolution of the last fifteen years in the context of three basic elements for helping young children with hearing loss and their families: diagnostics, fitting hearing aids and treatment. Early screening and the consequent early diagnosis of hearing loss in neonates triggered the transformation of support arrangements for young children with hearing loss and their families.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: 
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" maintains a similar meaning focused on the impairment of hearing ability. Text A discusses hearing loss specifically in the context of conditions causing perilymph fistulas and their surgical treatments, including cases resulting in improvements in hearing after such treatments. Text B highlights a proactive approach to hearing loss by detailing an early hearing screening program for newborns, aiming at early detection and intervention with hearing aids and potentially cochlear implants.

Despite the varied specifics in each text— one detailing surgical repair and the other focusing on early diagnosis and intervention—the core concept of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction or impairment in the ability to hear remains constant. Both texts address the diagnostic, treatment, and management aspects related to hearing loss, indicating that the semantic meaning of the word has stayed unchanged over the period examined."
10,Hearing loss,"Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were evaluated in three patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy belonging to the same family. This study showed marked alterations of BAEPs in all patients: reduction of wave amplitude, poor repeatability of responses in test-retest and abnormalities in wave form and latency. The neuroradiological examinations (CT-scan, MRI) did not show significant structural brain abnormalities. Abnormal BAEPs in our patients may be related to central metabolic disorder rather than hearing loss.","Purpose The purpose of this review was to examine the research activity relating to the role of the general practitioner (GP) in managing age-related hearing loss in older adults. Method A literature search of peer-reviewed journal articles published in English was conducted in online bibliographic databases using multiple variations of the keywords ""general practitioner"" and ""hearing."" Results The search strategy identified 3,255 articles. The abstracts of all articles were screened with 124 full-text records subsequently assessed for eligibility. Forty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Conclusions For people with hearing loss, the GP can play an instrumental role in guiding appropriate and timely choices for addressing hearing concerns. There are a range of quick, easy, and sensitive methods available to GPs to assist the objective evaluation of hearing. The evidence suggests that implementing hearing screening programs targeting older adults will increase rates of hearing loss detection and subsequently increase the number of patients receiving hearing loss intervention. Education and training appear key to improving GPs' screening, management, and referral of patients with hearing loss in the primary health care setting.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""hearing loss"" refers to the reduction or deterioration in the ability to hear. In Text A, the study focuses on identifying any relations between ""hearing loss"" and the central metabolic disorder through the evaluation of brainstem auditory evoked potentials, indicating concerns still centered around the impairment of hearing capabilities. Text B discusses ""hearing loss"" in the context of its management by general practitioners, especially among older adults, and highlights the importance of detecting and addressing it. Both texts, despite their different focus areas and study specifics, fundamentally deal with the understanding and management of diminished hearing abilities. The core meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a decline in hearing functionality remains consistent between the two periods."
11,Hearing loss,"alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) deficiency is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease, and only three alpha-NAGA-deficient patients with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Kanzaki) have been described. We report a further case in a 47-year-old Japanese woman, the product of a consanguineous marriage. The remarkable findings in this patient were her normal intelligence, Ménière's syndrome, disturbance of peripheral sensory nerves, hearing loss and cardiac hypertrophy. alpha-NAGA enzyme activity in her plasma was 0.77% of the normal value. Other enzyme activities, such as alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, alpha-L-fucosidase, beta-mannosidase and aspartylglucosaminidase, were within normal limits. A large quantity of amino acid O-glycans was detected in her urine. Gene analysis revealed a novel point mutation (G-->A transition) at nucleotide 11018 (986 in the cDNA) resulting in an Arg-329-Gln substitution. Kanzaki disease has the same enzyme defect as Schindler disease, but the manifestations are quite different.","Recent publications reported that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience an increased risk of suffering sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), however, these cases are poorly understood. This study aims to explore the clinical presentations and hearing recovery of SSNHL patients with RA.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
  In both texts, the target word ""hearing loss"" refers to a reduction in hearing ability. In Text A from an earlier time, ""hearing loss"" is specifically referenced in the context of a patient's symptoms associated with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency and other related medical conditions. The word describes a straightforward medical condition affecting an individual's auditory capabilities.

  In Text B from a more recent period, ""hearing loss"" also describes the condition of reduced hearing, particularly in the form of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) associated with patients having rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here again, it refers to the medical condition of diminished auditory function, though in a slightly different medical context (i.e., associated with RA). 

  While the contexts in which ""hearing loss"" appears differ—with various underlying causes or associated health conditions—the fundamental meaning of the term as a reduction in hearing capability does not change between the texts. It remains medically used to describe auditory impairment."
12,Hearing loss,"From 1972 to 1979 transtemporal neurectomy of the vestibular nerve was performed on 42 patients suffering from therapy-resistant symptoms of ménière's disease. Regular postoperative follow-up for 3 to 10 years after neurectomy showed that all 42 patients had no further attacks of vertigo. Tinnitus was diminished or disappeared in 25 patients; postoperative audiologic controls revealed no changes in 20 patients (48%), and a hearing gain in 3 cases (7%). 19 patients (45%) present with a slowly progredient hearing loss in continuation of the preoperative development.

Aim of this study was to evaluate if haemorheological changes and some indexes of hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis are associated with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL).,"- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" refers to the decline in hearing ability. In Text A, ""hearing loss"" is discussed as a progression in patients with Ménière's disease after a medical procedure, indicating a continuous deterioration of hearing associated with a specific health condition. In Text B, ""hearing loss"" appears in the context of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL), focusing on an acute medical condition with unknown etiology that results in a swift decline in hearing ability. Although both texts discuss different specifics and types of hearing loss (progressive vs. sudden), the fundamental meaning of the term — a reduction in hearing capacity — remains consistent across both texts. Therefore, the word ""hearing loss"" has not undergone a significant shift in meaning and is used in a similar medical context regarding auditory impairment."
13,Hearing loss,"Production agriculture is associated with a variety of occupational illnesses and injuries. Agricultural workers are at higher risk of death or disabling injury than most other workers. Traumatic injury commonly occurs from working with machinery or animals. Respiratory illness and health problems from exposures to farm chemicals are major concerns, and dermatoses, hearing loss, certain cancers, and zoonotic infections are important problems. Innovative means of encouraging safe work practices are being developed. Efforts are being made to reach all groups of farmworkers, including migrant and seasonal workers, farm youth, and older farmers.","The aging cochlea is subjected to a number of pathological changes to play a role in the onset of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Although ARHL has often been thought of as the result of the loss of hair cells, it is in fact a disorder with a complex etiology, arising from the changes to both the organ of Corti and its supporting structures. In this study, we examine two aging pathologies that have not been studied in detail despite their apparent prevalence; the fusion, elongation, and engulfment of cochlear inner hair cell stereocilia, and the changes that occur to the tectorial membrane (TM), a structure overlying the organ of Corti that modulates its physical properties in response to sound. Our work demonstrates that similar pathological changes occur in these two structures in the aging cochleae of both mice and humans, examines the ultrastructural changes that underlie stereocilial fusion, and identifies the lost TM components that lead to changes in membrane structure. We place these changes into the context of the wider pathology of the aging cochlea, and identify how they may be important in particular for understanding the more subtle hearing pathologies that precede auditory threshold loss in ARHL.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" is used to describe the impairment or reduction in the ability to hear. Text A discusses hearing loss as one of the occupational health concerns for agricultural workers, attributing it to environmental factors related to the workplace. Text B focuses on age-related hearing loss (ARHL) describing it as a complex condition with multiple underlying pathologies, specifically detailing biological factors and changes occurring within the ear. Despite the different focuses (occupational versus age-related contexts), the core meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing capability remains consistent. There is no significant shift in meaning or connotation between the two texts, thus indicating that the semantic drift for ""hearing loss"" is unchanged."

However, the underlying mechanism behind HL in AD remains elusive. A possible mechanism is cognitive load hypothesis, which postulates that over-processing of degraded auditory signals in the auditory cortex leads to deficits in other cognitive functions. Given mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of AD, untangling the association between HL and MCI might provide insights for potential mechanism behind HL.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, ""hearing loss"" is discussed primarily in the context of its association with cigarette smoking, suggesting a focus on the medical and lifestyle implications influencing the physical condition of hearing loss. This usage revolves around understanding factors that potentially cause or exacerbate hearing loss. In Text B, however, the consideration of ""hearing loss"" extends into a broader neurocognitive context, where it is seen as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associated with cognitive phenomena such as the cognitive load hypothesis. This expanded context marks a shift from a straightforward medical/lifestyle risk factor to an integral component in understanding and potentially intervening in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, the meaning of ""hearing loss"" has broadened significantly to include implications on cognitive health and neurological conditions, indicating a semantic drift in its use and conceptualization over time."

This is a chronic condition that affects the elderly population, and sensorineural progressive bilateral symmetry occurs with predominantly high-frequency hearing loss. The ability to discriminate speech decreases; hence, most of the affected patients have conversation problems, especially in noisy environments.This situation is a serious problem among elderly individuals. Social isolation, depression, and paranoia can be related to presbycusis.","###Answer:
- **Target word:** Hearing loss
- **Text A:** Focuses on hearing loss as primarily a condition detected early in life, specifically newborns. The aim presented is early identification and intervention to avoid lifelong impairments, framing hearing loss in the context of early life medical screening.
- **Text B:** Deals with hearing loss primarily as an age-related, progressive condition affecting the elderly (presbycusis). It describes symptoms and broader social and psychological ramifications of hearing loss that develops as a part of aging.

- **Label:** Changed
- **Reason:** Although both Text A and Text B discuss the same condition—'hearing loss'—the contexts and associative implications in each text exhibit significant differences. In Text A, hearing loss is treated as a detectable and potentially treatable condition in newborns, with an emphasis on prevention of future impairment. In contrast, Text B portrays hearing loss as an inevitable, degenerative aspect of aging that leads to communication difficulties and social issues like isolation and depression. Therefore, from Text A to Text B, the meaning of 'hearing loss' has shifted from a condition with potential for early intervention and prevention to a chronic, inevitable decline associated with aging, suggesting a semantic drift in terms of context, perception, and consequences over time."

18,Hearing loss,"Acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) were measured ipsilaterally in 20 neonates, 220 children with normal hearing and 56 children with sensorineural hearing loss, using a probe-tone frequency of 660 Hz. Middle-ear function was assessed with tympanometry (220 Hz probe tone) in all children. All the neonates had normal tympanograms and middle- ear pressure better than -- 1kPa, even a few hours after birth. The mean acoustic reflex threshold (ART) averaged over the frequency range 0.5-4 kHz was 85 dB HL, with standard deviations (SD) varying between 5 and 9 dB. With broad-band noise (BBN), the mean ART average was 57 dB HL with SD +/- 10 dB. Measurements of the ART on the children with normal-hearing and at an age of 1 month up to 5 years showed that the ARTs increased in relation to age. At 4 kHz the ARTs increased from an age of 2 months. At an age of one year 28% of 40 ears failed to manifest a reflex at the maximum testing level (90 dB HL). At frequencies 1.0 and 2.0 kHz the mean ART increased from 85 dB HL in neonates to 90 and 92 dB HL at an age of 5 years. The standard deviations in the different age groups varied between 4 and 9 dB for pure tones and 6-8 dB for BBN. Twenty (9%) of the 220 children with normal hearing had elevated ARTs by puretone stimuli and 19 by BBN. No reflexes could be elicited at 0.5 kHz and at 1.0 and 2.0 kHz the ARTs were abnormally elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is usually one of the main problems in industrial settings.

Text A discusses the context of sensorineural hearing loss in children and its measurement techniques, emphasizing the clinical aspect of hearing ability and its assessment. Text B focuses on noise-induced hearing loss among workers in industrial settings, which is a specific cause of reduced hearing ability due to environmental factors. Although the specific causes and contexts differ between texts (developmental/sensorineural versus occupational/noise-induced), the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction or impairment in the normal function of hearing remains consistent across both documents."
19,Hearing loss,"Good directional hearing ability demands good and symmetrical hearing in both ears. We report the effect of impaired hearing on the directional hearing ability of 98 patients, especially of patients with bilateral asymmetrical hearing loss. The directional testing device included 12 loudspeakers placed at 30 degree intervals in a circle with a diameter of 3.25 m, whose centre lay between the ears of the patient. In included an audiometer for producing the signals, an amplifier and a PDP11/23 computer interfaced to a loudspeaker switch bank. The subject's answers to 60 directionally randomized stimuli were recorded. During the presentation of the signal the patients were not allowed to turn their head. The patients had to name the number of the loudspeaker on the circle that they thought was producing the sound. In addition to the directional hearing test a pure-tone audiogram was done, and the middle- and high-frequency hearing loss estimated. The records of the directional hearing test were analysed in two new ways: firstly, vector analysis of the errors; secondly, averaging of the difference between the true interaural time delay and the virtual time difference, which was implicated in the possibly incorrect answer of the patient (effective delta-t-parameter). This average gives a score for the uncertainty in defining the correct ""cone of confusion"". In addition to the statistical analysis, two cases are reported showing the directional hearing ability of two patients with neuromas treated by transtemporal surgery, with some residual hearing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Hypertrophy of adenoids is usually caused by repeated throat infections, especially viral and bacterial infections, that in microscopic examination reveal reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. Herein, we present an 11-year-old boy who developed hearing loss in his left ear three months before admission, and in direct examination the adenoids were hypertrophied. Histopathological study of the resected adenoid revealed caseating granulomatous inflammation. Based on histopathological and clinical findings, primary tuberculosis of adenoids was suggested which was confirmed by PCR.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" clearly refers to the impairment or reduction of hearing ability in an individual. Text A discusses how asymmetrical hearing loss impacts directional hearing ability and utilizes a detailed clinical study setup to evaluate this effect in patients. Text B provides a clinical case where hearing loss is attributed to enlarged adenoids due to infection, affecting the hearing ability of a young patient. In both cases, ""hearing loss"" consistently describes a condition where hearing performance decreases from a normal or previous level, focusing distinctly on the physiological aspect of hearing impairment. Thus, the semantic usage of ""hearing loss"" remains the same across both texts, indicating no significant semantic drift."
20,Hearing loss,"A family is presented that had what is believed to be a previously undescribed syndrome of granulomatous synovitis, bilateral recurrent uveitis, and cranial neuropathies. Affected members included the proband, his brother, father, and probably the decreased paternal grandmother. Disease onset was in childhood. Each had symmetric, boggy polysynovitis of the hands and wrists, resulting in nearly identical boutonniere deformities. Hand radiography in the proband and his brother revealed no erosions or joint destruction despite more than 20 years of disease. Synovectomy specimens in the proband and his brother showed granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. Recurrent, nongranulomatous, acute iridocyclitis with visual impairment afflicted the proband, brother, and father. Apparently corticosteroid-responsive bilateral neurosensory hearing loss occurred in the proband, and a transient sixth cranial nerve palsy in his brother. All members of the family were antinuclear antibody-, rheumatoid factor-, and HLA-B27-negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were within normal limits in all family members. The inheritance pattern of this syndrome is most consistent with an autosomal dominant mode.","Musicians are at risk of hearing loss from sound exposure, and earplugs form part of many musicians' hearing conservation practices. Although musicians typically report a range of difficulties when wearing earplugs, there are many who have managed to successfully incorporate earplugs into their practice of music.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the term ""hearing loss"" refers directly to the impairment or reduction in the ability to hear. In Text A, ""bilateral neurosensory hearing loss"" describes a medical condition affecting the hearing capabilities of family members, likely due to an inherited syndrome. In Text B, the term is used in the context of musicians experiencing hearing loss due to exposure to loud sounds, emphasizing the risk and preventive measures related to their occupational hazard. In both cases, ""hearing loss"" maintains its primary medical definition, indicating a decrease in the ability to hear, despite the different causes (genetic in Text A versus environmental/exposure in Text B). Thus, the meaning of the term has not undergone significant semantic drift over the years examined."
21,Hearing loss,"In this paper we introduce the results obtained using 40 Hz potentials, with 500 and 1,000 Hz stimuli, in patients with neurosensory hearing loss, with and without preservation of low frequencies.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the word ""hearing loss"" refers to the same clinical condition characterized by the reduction in the ability to hear sounds. In Text A, the focus is on the evaluation of neurosensory hearing loss using auditory potentials, describing a medical study approach to understanding its characteristics. In Text B, hearing loss is discussed as a symptom associated with Waardenburg syndrome, a genetic disorder. Although the context in which hearing loss is referenced varies between the texts — one focusing on clinical testing in neurosensory impairments and the other as an associated symptom in a genetic disorder — the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing capabilities remains consistent across both texts. Thus, the core semantic understanding of ""hearing loss"" has not experienced a significant drift between the periods reflected by the two texts."
22,Hearing loss,"The present study examined the usefulness of personal variables: noise annoyance, and components of the protection motivation theory (R. W. Rogers, 1983) along with social-organizational factors in explaining hearing protection device (HPD) use among Israeli manufacturing workers. Participants were 281 men exposed to harmful noise levels for which routine HPD use is required by regulation. In practice, 3 HPD user groups were identified: nonusers (n = 38), occasional users (n = 125), and regular users (n = 118). HPD use was objectively verified. HPD use was primarily related to the personal variables but not to management pressure, coworker pressure, or family support. The most powerful predictors of HPD use were perceived self-efficacy (for long-term HPD use), perceived susceptibility (to hearing loss), and noise annoyance, together explaining 48% of the outcome variance. These findings have implications for interventions aimed at motivating workers to use HPDs regularly.","This article reviews some of the otolaryngologic manifestations of skeletal dysplasias. Achondroplasia is discussed most comprehensively. Skeletal dysplasias are bone and cartilage disorders that disrupt the development of the long bones, craniofacial skeleton, and vertebral column, with the most notable characteristic being short stature. Children with skeletal dysplasias have various medical problems. These children often develop head and neck manifestations of their disorders. Hearing loss, middle ear disease, and respiratory difficulties are seen in these children. Otolaryngologists must be knowledgeable about these disorders to diagnose, treat, and appropriately refer children with skeletal dysplasias.","- Label: Unchanged

In Text A, hearing loss is mentioned as a risk that can be mitigated through the use of hearing protection devices among workers exposed to harmful noise levels. Text B addresses hearing loss as one of the otolaryngologic manifestations seen in children with skeletal dysplasias, linking it to medical conditions.

23,Hearing loss,"Hearing losses estimated for exposure to industrial and gun noise and for ""typical"" nosocusis are applied to the distributions of the hearing levels of adult males and females of the general population of an industrialized society unscreened for exposure to noise or ear disease. Noise exposure and demographic data applicable to the United States, and procedures for predicting noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) and nosocusis, were used to account for some 8.7 dB of the 13.4 dB average difference between the hearing levels at high frequencies for otologically and noise screened versus unscreened male ears; (this average difference is for the average of the hearing levels at 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, average for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, and ages 20-65 years). According to the present calculations, this difference is due, in order of importance, to (1) nosocusis, (2) exposure to gun noise, and (3) exposure of workers to industrial noise. For these same frequencies and overall average, adjustments for nosocusis accounts for 2 dB of the 5.9-dB difference between the hearing levels of screened and unscreened female ears. For the average at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz, the overall differences between the screened and unscreened populations is but 3.4 dB for males and 2.9 dB for females. The adjustment procedures reduced these differences to -0.5 and 0.9 dB, respectively.","The dissemination of newborn hearing screening (NHS) has enabled those with mild to moderate hearing loss to be diagnosed in early infancy. The ""handicapped independence support law"", however, prevents those not determined to be physically handicapped; i.e., those with mild to moderate hearing loss-, from government assistance in purchasing hearing aids. This results either in (i) parents purchasing hearing aids at their own expense or (ii) nonpurchase of hearing aids. To redress this situation, subvention in purchasing hearing aids of mild to moderate hearing loss children has been begun by some local governments. We petitioned for such aid at the Okayama Prefecture Assembly. A society for supporting pediatric hearing difficulty in Okayama Prefecture also submitted a similar petition in September 2009, and subvention began in April 2010 for all such children in Okayama Prefecture. We report procedures and details leading to this subvention.","- Label: Unchanged

Both Text A and Text B discuss the term ""hearing loss"" within similar medical and environmental contexts. In Text A, the focus is on hearing loss measured against industrial noise exposure, gun noise, and ""typical"" nosocusis, analyzing its statistical impact on the auditory health of populations. Text B talks about the accessibility and societal support for individuals, particularly infants, with mild to moderate hearing loss diagnoses due to newborn hearing screenings. In both texts, ""hearing loss"" retains its central medical connotation related to the reduction in hearing ability, irrespective of the causes or the demographic considered. The semantic core of the phrase remains focused on the decrease in auditory capability, although the discussions around it involve different support systems and severity assessments (industrial impact vs newborn diagnosis and government aid). Thus, the basic meaning and context of ""hearing loss"" have not undergone a significant shift between the two periods."
24,Hearing loss,"Sensorineural hearing loss is frequently reported in young patients with chronic renal failure having haemodialysis. The effect of a single session of haemodialysis on hearing acuity was assessed prospectively in nine children with end-stage renal disease using pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Results were compared with those obtained from nine audiologically normal healthy children also tested with PTA and DPOAEs twice during a 4-h interval. Sensorineural hearing loss of unknown aetiology was found in 55.5% of renal patients, mainly in the higher frequencies. Patients on HD had mean PTA thresholds significantly poorer than those of the control group in the frequency range 1000-12 000Hz (P < 0.05). Their mean DPOAE amplitudes were significantly lower in all frequencies > 1184 Hz (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients' ears with normal PTA thresholds between 250 and 4000 Hz also had decreased DPOAE amplitudes. No significant changes in PTA thresholds or DPOAE amplitudes were encountered in renal patients before and after a HD session (P > 0.05). Changes in PTA thresholds or DPOAE amplitudes were not significantly different than those in the control group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, sensorineural hearing loss of unknown origin, especially in high frequencies, is frequent in young renal patients under HD and single HD sessions do not seem to alter the hearing acuity of these patients. DPOAEs seem to be more sensitive to incipient cochlear damage than behaviour thresholds in monitoring renal patients.","The lack of an effective method of drug delivery has been a considerable obstacle in the development of novel therapeutics for inner ear diseases. However, several strategies have been investigated to achieve drug delivery to the inner ear, particularly for local application. Here, we review recent advances in the development of inner ear drug-delivery systems, focusing on biodegradable materials. Both synthetic and natural biodegradable materials have shown efficacy for inner ear drug delivery, resulting in an attenuation of hearing loss in animal models. We expect the further development of such drug-delivery systems to help translate the findings of experimental studies to clinical applications.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
The target word ""hearing loss"" in both Text A and Text B consistently reflects the loss of hearing ability, though the contexts in which it is discussed differ. In Text A from an earlier period, the word is utilized primarily in a clinical study context involving patients with chronic renal failure, emphasizing the occurrence and characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss among these patients and the effects of hemodialysis on their hearing. In Text B from a later period, the discussion focuses on the delivery of therapeutic treatments to mitigate or treat hearing loss, specifically referring to innovations in drug-delivery systems for the inner ear. While the focus shifts from observing and diagnosing to potentially treating or mitigating the condition, the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction or impairment in hearing ability remains unchanged across the two texts."
25,Hearing loss,"There are several countries in the world in which people with severe hearing loss are not eligible for a car driver's license. As a technical approach to solve this problem, an electronic device is developed which detects traffic-alarm-sounds, i.e. horns of cars, sirens of emergency vehicles and alarm signals of railroad crossings, and then displays them as vibration to the driver. The basic operating principle of the device is that those traffic-alarm-sounds have marked regularity in some particular frequency region whereas the traffic noise is a wide-band random noise. The real time detection of the regularity is realized by use of a phase-locked-loop and a simplified lock-in amplifier. The results of simulation experiments and road tests demonstrate that the performance of the device is satisfactory except in the case of the detection of the alarm signals of railroad crossings.","To demonstrate the feasibility and clinical significance of cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) test in pediatric patients.Retrospective review study was conducted in a pediatric tertiary care facility. A total of 278 patients were identified with adequate data, including medical notes, results of cVEMP, and imaging studies.Among the total of 278 pediatric patients, only 3 children were not able to finish the cVEMP test successfully. In about 90% of the cases, the cVEMP test was requested to investigate a patient's hearing loss and/or vestibular complaints. Over 90% of the cVEMP tests were ordered by specialists such as pediatric otolaryngologists or otologists. Obtained cVEMP results provided useful information in clinical diagnosis and management in all cases.It is feasible to conduct cVEMP testing in children, including infants, and cVEMP testing can provide valuable information in the diagnosis and management of hearing loss and vestibular impairment. This simple and noninvasive test should be embraced by pediatric professionals. ","###Answer:

- Reason: The context and implications of ""hearing loss"" in both texts show considerable drift. In Text A, the term is associated directly with a functional limitation that affects daily activities such as driving and the emphasis lies on technological solutions to mitigate this impact. In Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" is evaluated from a medical perspective, with emphasis on diagnostic procedures and health management, indicating a shift from practical limitations to clinical and health-oriented concerns. Hence, between the texts, the usage transitions from a focus on compensatory tools for daily functionality to a medical and diagnostic focus, representing a significant shift in connotation and application."
26,Hearing loss,"A patient presented with sudden hearing loss on her first visit to our department. Gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the posterior cranial fossa portrayed an intracanalicular tumour image (2-3 mm), and the pure tone average (PTA) and speech discrimination score (SDS) values were 65 dB and 60 per cent, respectively. Surgical intervention to remove the suspected tumour was scheduled by the translabyrinthine approach. Intracanalicular observations by the retrolabyrinthine approach revealed limited oedema on the inferior vestibular nerve with vascular dilation. The tumour image disappeared two years after the operation. Surgical findings and the post-operative course advocate that gadolinium-DTPA-enriched MRI image of an intracanalicular lesion such as arachnoiditis might produce a false-positive result.","In a replication study, the researcher investigated the effects of a 4-week vocabulary intervention in which he and a teacher used direct instruction to teach 16 multiple-meaning words to three hard of hearing students in a fifth-grade classroom who read at low levels. The vocabulary intervention was adopted from a study by Alqraini and Paul (2020) in which multiple-meaning words were taught to students with profound hearing loss in Saudi Arabia. In the present study, a single-subject experimental design was used to implement the vocabulary intervention. It was found that the students' performance in word recognition and comprehension improved after the intervention. However, the three students showed different levels of improvement.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In Text A, the target word ""hearing loss"" is used in the context of a medical condition affecting an individual's auditory ability, leading to interventions such as MRI and surgical treatment targeting the cause of the hearing impairment. The focus here is on the sudden loss of hearing due to a medical issue, possibly linked to an intracanalicular tumor.

In Text B, ""hearing loss"" relates to the educational challenges and interventions required for students who have impaired hearing capability. The context involves addressing the difficulties faced by students with hearing loss in learning new vocabulary, aiming to improve their academic performance through specialized teaching methods.

Despite the difference in specific topics being addressed (medical treatment in Text A and educational intervention in Text B), the essential meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a condition of reduced or absent auditory capability remains consistent between both texts. There is no significant change in the underlying definition of the term, but rather a variation in the type of challenges and solutions discussed in relation to hearing loss in different settings - medical versus educational. Thus, the term ""hearing loss"" has not undergone semantic drift and maintains a similar connotation in both texts."

Text B mentions ""hearing loss"" as one of the symptoms presented in genetic disorders (Branchiootorenal and branchiooculofacial syndromes), focusing on a genetic and syndromic viewpoint. In both cases, ""hearing loss"" fundamentally implies a loss of hearing ability, whether occurring suddenly (as in Text A) or as part of a genetic syndrome (as in Text B). Thus, the core meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing capacity remains consistent across both texts, despite the different contexts in which it is discussed."
28,Hearing loss,"Cytomegalovirus IgM (CMV IgM) antibodies of 582 cord sera from 6 hospitals in Chengdu were detected by direct ELISA and indirect ELISA. Twenty-seven cases with CMV IgM antibody positive were detected from 582 cord sera.

Oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1) is a rare condition with X-linked dominant inheritance caused by mutations in the Cxorf5 (OFD1) gene. This gene encodes the OFD1 protein located within centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia. Approximately 15-50% of patients with OFD1 progress to end-stage kidney disease following development of polycystic changes within the kidneys. This condition almost always causes intrauterine lethality in males. Description of Case Diagnosis and Treatment. A Caucasian male aged 9 years and 9 months presented with increased urinary frequency, increased thirst, and decreased appetite. Physical examination demonstrated short stature, hearing loss, photophobia, murmur, and hypogonadism. He had no other dysmorphic features. Laboratory results revealed anemia, renal insufficiency, and dilute urine with microscopic hematuria but no proteinuria. Ultrasound showed small kidneys with increased echogenicity but no evidence of cystic changes. A Ciliopathy Panel showed a novel and likely pathogenic deletion, approximately 7.9 kb, in the OFD1 gene encompassing exons 16, 17, and 19 (c.1654+833_2599+423del). Brain MRI did not demonstrate typical OFD1 findings. He is currently on chronic hemodialysis awaiting transplant from a living donor. Conclusions. We present a male patient with OFD1 mutation who lacks the classic OFD1 phenotype who presented with end-stage renal disease without evidence of polycystic changes within the kidneys.

29,Hearing loss,"The records of 184 patients implanted with the XOMED Audiant Bone Conductor (XOMED Inc, Jacksonville, Fla) prior to March 1988 were reviewed retrospectively to determine the safety of this device. Complications were few and minor in nature. Effectiveness was judged from the audiometric data obtained from the 96 patients in the hearing part of this study, all of whom had improved hearing with the device. The mean preoperative pure-tone air-conduction three-frequency average threshold +/- SD in the implanted ear was 55.8 +/- 10.7-dB hearing level; postoperative average aided warble-tone threshold was 19.9 +/- 8.5-dB hearing level. The average improvement in threshold was 36.0 +/- 13.3 dB. Ninety-three percent of patients achieved socially adequate hearing, ie, mean aided sound-field thresholds of at least 30-dB hearing level, and 81% had thresholds of at least 25-dB hearing level. We conclude that the XOMED Audiant Bone Conductor is a safe and effective device for the surgical correction of conductive hearing loss.","The envelope following response (EFR) has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of synaptopathy in animal models. However, its amplitude is affected by the spread of basilar-membrane excitation and other coexisting sensorineural hearing deficits. This study aims to (i) improve frequency specificity of the EFR by introducing a derived-band EFR (DBEFR) technique and (ii) investigate the effect of lifetime noise exposure, age and outer-hair-cell (OHC) damage on DBEFR magnitudes. Additionally, we adopt a modelling approach to validate the frequency-specificity of the DBEFR and test how different aspects of sensorineural hearing loss affect peripheral generators. The combined analysis of simulations and experimental data proposes that the DBEFRs extracted from the [2-6]-kHz frequency band is a sensitive and frequency-specific measure of synaptopathy in humans. Individual variability in DBEFR magnitudes among listeners with normal audiograms was explained by their self-reported amount of experienced lifetime noise-exposure and corresponded to amplitude variability predicted by synaptopathy. Older listeners consistently had reduced DBEFR magnitudes in comparison to young normal-hearing listeners, in correspondence to how age-induced synaptopathy affects EFRs and compromises temporal envelope encoding. To a lesser degree, OHC damage was also seen to affect the DBEFR magnitude, hence the DBEFR metric should ideally be combined with a sensitive marker of OHC damage to offer a differential diagnosis of synaptopathy in listeners with impaired audiograms.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
The target word ""hearing loss"" is consistently used in both Text A and Text B to refer to impairments in hearing ability, despite the technological and methodological advancements described in either text. Text A focuses on the effectiveness of a surgical device in treating hearing loss, examining improvements in hearing thresholds post-surgery. Text B discusses a study on how various factors like noise exposure and aging influence sensorineural aspects of hearing, particularly in relation to a specific type of hearing loss (synaptopathy). Both texts, therefore, discuss hearing loss with a strong focus on evaluating and addressing its implications through medical or technological means, without a noticeable shift in the fundamental understanding or meaning of ""hearing loss."""
30,Hearing loss,"Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) were stimulated using clicks or 1-kHz tone bursts in both ears of 31 patients with unilateral Meniere's disease. Using click stimuli, responses were present in 29/31 of the non-Meniere's ears and in 26/31 of the Meniere's ears. Stimulation using 1-kHz tone bursts produced responses in 30/31 of the non-Meniere's ears and in 28/31 of the Meniere's ears. Audiometric configuration strongly influenced the presence of TEOAEs in the affected ears. In all but 2 ears with average hearing sensitivity (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) poorer than 25 dB HL, responses were present only when accompanied by at least one pure-tone threshold better than 30 dB HL from 0.75 to 2 kHz. In the opposite ears, all of which had essentially normal hearing, responses were approximately 5 dB lower in level and contained fewer spectral peaks in comparison with results obtained from a normative database. Neither age nor pure-tone results could account for these differences. Thus, TEOAEs obtained from patients with Meniere's disease manifest features that may be considered as atypical either in comparison to results from ears with normal hearing or from ears with relatively flat sensorineural hearing losses due to other etiologies.","Background: Human immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescents have insufficient CD4 T cell count, and despite attaining viral suppression with HAART regimen, some experience significant hearing loss.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" refers explicitly to the reduction in hearing capacity, which aligns with its standard definition as the diminished ability to hear sounds. Text A discusses the presence and influence of hearing sensitivity levels, particularly in patients with Meniere's disease, using otoacoustic emissions testing to gauge hearing response variations. This context places ""hearing loss"" within the medical study of auditory health affected by specified conditions.

Text B also addresses ""hearing loss"" in the context of adolescents with HIV, where despite medical treatment for the virus, there is an observed significant loss in hearing ability, suggesting a complicating factor directly associated with either the disease or its treatment. The term is used within a medical scenario to describe a decline in auditory function, similar to Text A.

Both texts use the term to discuss reductions in hearing capabilities due to different health-related issues, with no significant shift in the meaning of ""hearing loss"" between the two periods. It maintains its medical and health-oriented connotation related to auditory functionality."
31,Hearing loss,"Hearing loss after spinal anesthesia has been reported to be related to the transmission of a reduced subarachnoid pressure to the inner ear via the cochlear aqueduct due to loss of spinal fluid.

We used logistical regression analysis to determine which factors are most strongly related to outcome for patients with SSNHL. In so doing, we employed a retrospective chart-review study. The study group consisted of 296 patients (296 ears). The outcome of SSNHL was cured (full recovery) in 64, recovered (partial recovery) in 175, and no change in 57. We performed separate analyses on those in the no-change and partial-recovery groups and on those in the no-change and full-recovery groups. The following factors were studied as explanatory variables: age; number of days until presentation; vestibular symptom; initial mean hearing level at 0.25 kHz, 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz; and treatments (steroids, satellite ganglion block). In the first analysis, for patients in the no-change and recovered groups, the factors most strongly related to outcome were the number of days until presentation and age. The second analysis, for the nochange and cured groups, revealed that the number of days until presentation, vestibular symptom, age, and initial mean hearing level were most strongly related to outcome. Our results will increase the ability to predict the outcome for SSNHL.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" retains its fundamental meaning as a medical condition involving the reduction or loss of hearing capabilities. Text A discusses hearing loss in relation to spinal anesthesia, exploring a specific situation and potential cause, while Text B addresses sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), focusing on the factors affecting prognosis and outcomes. Despite differing contexts — one concerning an associative cause and the other analyzing prognostic factors — the primary interpretation of ""hearing loss"" as a deficiency in hearing ability remains consistent between them. Both texts employ the term in a medical and clinical context, showing no significant semantic drift over time."
32,Hearing loss,"Because several cases of cerebral-spinal fluid leakage (perilymph gushers) have been reported during stapedectomy for congenitally fixed stapes in children, many otologists advise against surgical intervention. The pathophysiologic mechanism of the gusher and its association with a congenitally fixed stapes is, however, poorly understood. This study was designed to examine the pre-operative presentation and hearing results of 10 children undergoing stapedectomies for congenital fixation. No perilymph gushers of significant sensorineural hearing loss was encountered. All but one case resulted in closure of the air-bone gap and speech frequencies to within 20 dB. The average air-bone gap was 11.2 dB. Minor congenital abnormalities of the stapes suprastructure were seen in 3 cases. Review of case reports in the literature indicate that gushers in association with surgical manipulation of the congenitally-fixed stapes occur almost exclusively in males and that pathophysiology involves a defect in the internal auditory canal (as opposed to a patent cochlear aqueduct). A pre-existing sensorineural hearing loss may also be a risk factor for perilymph gusher.","Despite the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) and engineering changes designed to improve workspaces, noise-induced hearing loss continues to be one of the most common and expensive disabilities in the US military. Many service members suffer acoustic trauma due to improper use of HPDs, sound levels exceeding the protective capacity of the HPDs, or by unexpected, injurious exposures. In these cases, there is no definitive treatment for the hearing loss. This study investigated the use of the pharmacological agents N-acetylcysteine and acetyl-L-carnitine after acoustic trauma to treat cochlear injury. N-Acetylcysteine is an antioxidant and acetyl-L-carnitine a compound that maintains mitochondrial bio-energy and integrity. N-Acetylcysteine and acetyl-L-carnitine, respectively, significantly reduced permanent threshold shifts and hair cell loss compared to saline-treated animals when given 1 and 4 h post-noise exposure. It may be possible to obtain a greater therapeutic effect using these agents in combination or at higher doses or for a longer period of time to address the secondary oxidative events occurring 7-10 days after acute noise exposure.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, ""hearing loss"" refers to the impairment or reduction of auditory ability. Text A discusses hearing loss in the context of congenital issues related to specific surgical outcomes (stapedectomies), while Text B discusses hearing loss as a result of noise exposure in a military environment and its treatment. Although the contexts of how hearing loss is experienced or induced are different — congenital versus noise-induced — the fundamental concept of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in the ability to hear remains consistent between the two texts. There is no significant shift in the meaning of the term; it consistently refers to problems with auditory function regardless of the cause."
33,Hearing loss,"One hundred children from 1 to 14 years of age had serous otitis media, the manifestations of which were bilateral in all but four patients. Thus, 196 ears were treated with aeration of the middle ear by means of a short transmyringeal tube. The mean duration of the treatment was 3.4 years, and the mean observation time was 7.3 years. Of the ears treated, 79.1% regained normal hearing, though scarring of the tympanic membrane and smaller adhesions were observed. The result was not satisfactory in 20.9% of the ears treated, the hearing losses varying from 25 to 60 dB. In 7.7% (15 ears) chronic otitis media developed; in 5.6% (11 of the 15 ears) cholesteatoma was confirmed surgically. Adhesive processes were present in 11.2%.","Hearing is a critical ability for the development of a child's speech and language. Many studies in different countries have shown the universal newborn hearing screening and early intervention has greatly reduced the negative impact caused by congenital hearing loss. The first universal newborn hearing screening program in Taiwan took place in MacKay Memorial Hospital in 1998 and was subsequently endorsed by the government. The incidence of bilateral congenital hearing impairment in Taiwan is approximately 2.6 per 1000 live birth. The aim of this paper is to analyze the age of diagnosis, hearing aid fitting, and intervention of congenitally hearing impaired children with and without hearing screening after public awareness and government endorsement of newborn hearing screening.","- Label: Unchanged

Text B discusses ""hearing loss"" within the context of early screening and intervention to prevent the adverse effects of congenital hearing impairment. In both texts, the target word ""hearing loss"" retains a medical and auditory function context—it consistently refers to a condition involving the reduction or impairment of the ability to hear, albeit under different circumstances (acquired vs. congenital). The underlying meaning of the term ""hearing loss"" remains focused on describing a deficiency in normal hearing function, thus showing no significant semantic drift between the two periods."
34,Hearing loss,"Background noise limits for audiometry are determined by the effects of masking and are specified in international standards. The standards provide for audiometric testing over a range of audiometric frequencies extending down to 500 Hz or lower. The lowest frequency of testing is an important factor determining the admissible noise, and for certain applications it is appropriate to consider the limits applicable to testing over a more restricted range. Assessment of hearing disability in the UK is generally based on a consideration of pure-tone hearing threshold levels in the frequency range 1 kHz upwards. A modification of the standardized noise limits is proposed which allows some relaxation appropriate to this higher minimum frequency. For air-conduction audiometry, these modifications affect only the permissible background noise in the frequency range below 1 kHz. Where bone-conduction audiometry is required in order to quantify a conductive component of the hearing loss, the measurements need to be made on both ears with the non-test ear masked in both cases; the external background noise will thus only be heard monaurally and this justifies a correction to the noise limits compared with those appropriate to bone-conduction audiometry without masking.","Previous studies have shown that miR-124 plays an important role in the development of auditory neurons, which are degenerated in the sensorineural hearing loss. However, whether the combined use of miR-124 and growth factors can increase the expression of neural related markers in human dental pulp stem cells has been remained unknown so far. In this study, human dental pulp stem cells were transfected with miR-124 following treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor or epidermal growth factor/basic fibroblast growth factor.

- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""hearing loss"" maintains a similar meaning related to issues with auditory function. Text A discusses the need for specific audiometric testing standards and conditions accurately assessing ""hearing loss"" through permissible background noise levels during the tests. Text B refers to ""sensorineural hearing loss"" in the context of research aimed at mitigating deafness through therapeutic approaches involving miR-124 and growth factors. Although Text A tackles methodological standards in testing auditory capabilities and Text B focuses on research for treating auditory neuron degeneration, both use the term ""hearing loss"" in relation to the impairment of hearing capabilities, keeping the core meaning consistent across the two time periods. Thus, the semantic drift for ""hearing loss"" is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
35,Hearing loss,"Diving injury may affect all parts of the ear during all types of diving. Divers are regularly exposed to noise and 120 dB(A) is measured during ventilation of a hyperbaric chamber. Ear canal squeeze, possibly with drum perforation, may give a transient conductive hearing loss. Middle ear squeeze, possibly with drum perforation, also gives a transient conductive loss. Inner ear barotrauma, possibly with perilymph fistula, most often results in transient vertigo and lasting sensorineural high tone loss, often resembling a noise-induced loss. Decompression sickness and gas embolism can also damage the inner ear. A change of breathing gas during deep diving has damaged the labyrinth, most likely due to counter diffusion. The authors have seen two cases of over window perilymph fistula resulting from diving. One of them also suffered a burst ear drum on the same side. His hearing returned to normal after surgical repair.","The thalassemias are among the most common genetic disorders worldwide, occurring more frequently in the Mediterranean region.

Both texts describe scenarios where ""hearing loss"" is a primary concern related to the physical state or condition of the ear, albeit in different circumstances (due to diving injuries in Text A and as a potential complication in genetic disorders in Text B). The underpinning concept of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction or damage to the normal function of hearing remains consistent between the texts, showing no significant semantic drift in its meaning or connotation over the periods examined."
36,Hearing loss,"The lesion location (cochlear vs. retrocochlear) of sensorineural hearing loss may be differentiated with a diagnostic index (delta V), which is calculated from the wave V latency of the monaurally evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR), and from the pure-tone hearing threshold at 2 and 4 kHz. The delta V values obtained from 80 recruiting ears have proven to correlate linearly to the amount of the hearing loss, hence allowing to define appropriate confidence boundaries for cochlear hearing losses. In contrast, the delta V values obtained from 32 ears of patients with retrocochlear lesions--cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors--were all found to exceed the 95% upper confidence limits projected for cochlear lesions, thus giving a 100% rate of true results in the detection of retrocochlear pathology. These results, providing an ABR parametric model for the cochlear hearing loss, suggest a diagnostic strategy for the early detection of CPA tumors based on the exclusion of a cochlear hearing loss.","Hearing loss in children is common and by age 18 years, affects nearly 1 of every 5 children. Without hearing rehabilitation, hearing loss can cause detrimental effects on speech, language, developmental, educational, and cognitive outcomes in children.","### Answer:

- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""hearing loss"" retains a similar meaning focused on the impairment of hearing capability. Text A discusses hearing loss primarily in the context of diagnostic techniques differentiating cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss using medical testing. Text B emphasizes the prevalence and impacts of hearing loss in children, focusing on its effect on speech, language, and cognitive development. Despite the different focuses—diagnostic in Text A and impacts in Text B—the essential meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a condition of diminished auditory capacity remains consistent between the two texts, without a shift in semantic content."
37,Hearing loss,"Time-compressed monosyllables have been studied relative to the assessment of central auditory disorders. In certain instances, sentential stimuli may be more useful than word lists in central auditory testing, particularly when results may be contaminated by concomitant peripheral hearing losses.

38,Hearing loss,"A 6-year experience of the Italian Air Force Medical Selection Centre in the audiological evaluation of candidates for employment is summarized. Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were introduced progressively from 1993 to analyse more effectively subjects affected with sensorineural hearing loss and reduce possible bias connected to standard audiometric tests. OAEs provided a useful tool to support pure-tone audiometry, providing more accurate audiological data. Finally, a reduction of medico-legal claims was observed in candidates undergoing OAE testing.","Hearing loss is a major risk factor for tinnitus, hyperacusis, and central auditory processing disorder. Although recent studies indicate that hearing loss causes neuroinflammation in the auditory pathway, the mechanisms underlying hearing loss-related pathologies are still poorly understood. We examined neuroinflammation in the auditory cortex following noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and its role in tinnitus in rodent models. Our results indicate that NIHL is associated with elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and microglial activation-two defining features of neuroinflammatory responses-in the primary auditory cortex (AI). Genetic knockout of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or pharmacologically blocking TNF-α expression prevented neuroinflammation and ameliorated the behavioral phenotype associated with tinnitus in mice with NIHL. Conversely, infusion of TNF-α into AI resulted in behavioral signs of tinnitus in both wild-type and TNF-α knockout mice with normal hearing. Pharmacological depletion of microglia also prevented tinnitus in mice with NIHL. At the synaptic level, the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) increased and that of miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) decreased in AI pyramidal neurons in animals with NIHL. This excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic imbalance was completely prevented by pharmacological blockade of TNF-α expression. These results implicate neuroinflammation as a therapeutic target for treating tinnitus and other hearing loss-related disorders.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B the essential thematic concern regarding ""hearing loss"" pertains largely to medical and physiological contexts. Text A discusses ""hearing loss"" in the realm of clinical audiology with a focus on diagnosis using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and it addresses implications such as medical-legal claims in audiological evaluations. Text B, although more advanced in terms of scientific understanding involving noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), neuroinflammation, and associated disorders like tinnitus, still centrally discusses ""hearing loss"" within a medical-scientific framework. Both texts treat ""hearing loss"" as an adverse medical condition affecting auditory functions but explored through different scientific advancements and implications in audiology and neurology. Therefore, despite differing details and depth of the medical research discussed, the core meaning and context of ""hearing loss"" as a medical condition remains consistent and unchanged between the two texts."
39,Hearing loss,"Profound changes in our society occurring over the past few decades have resulted in a major shift in societal emphasis from labor to communication. The widespread use of personal computers has enhanced the importance of information-communication in daily life. People with communication disorders are at substantial risk of underemployment and lowered quality of life. Advances in medical science and hearing health care have placed us on the thresholds of being able to correct, rather than remediate, certain types of hearing loss. The finding that auditory hair cells of submammalian species regenerate has stimulated greatly the field of auditory research. A new lexicon is required to describe this emerging field. Methods exist to protect against hearing loss, repair affected structures prior to their degeneration, promote dedifferentiation-redifferentiation of undamaged structures into sensory cells, and, finally, promote regeneration of new sensory cells from precursor cells. Each of these processes has unique requirements, and all may be required to promote the restoration of hearing following damage or disease.","Patients with chronic renal failure often suffer from hearing loss and the most common cause is sensorineural hearing loss.

40,Hearing loss,"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL or presbyacusis) is an increasingly common form of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as a result of changing demographics, and the auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a common experimental and clinical tool in audiology and neurology. Some of the changes that occur in the aging auditory system may significantly influence the interpretation of the ABR in comparison to the ABRs of younger adults. The approach of this review will be to integrate physiological and histopathological data from human and animal studies to provide a better understanding of the array of age-related changes in the ABR and to determine how age-related changes in the auditory system may influence how the ABR should be interpreted in presbyacusis. Data will be described in terms of thresholds, latencies, and amplitudes, as well as more complex auditory functions such as masking and temporal processing. Included in the review of data will be an attempt to differentiate between age-related effects that may strictly be due to threshold elevation from those that may be due to the aging process.","Cochlear implants (CIs) give children with severe to profound hearing loss access to sound.

In Text A, the context shows hearing loss as part of a syndromic presentation, highlighting the concept as a physiological or sensory deficiency. In Text B, hearing loss is discussed concerning a specific malformation of the inner ear (EVA), indicating an anatomic and clinical assessment of hearing deficiencies. In both instances, hearing loss refers to the impairment or reduction in the ability to hear sound, indicating that the fundamental meaning of the term remains consistent across the two texts.

42,Hearing loss,To compare 2 screening methods for unrecognized handicapping hearing loss in the elderly.,"Cochlear implants are currently the most effective solution for profound sensorineural hearing loss, and vestibular prostheses are under development to treat bilateral vestibulopathies. Electrical current spread in these neuroprostheses limits channel independence and, in some cases, may impair their performance. In comparison, optical stimuli that are spatially confined may result in a significant functional improvement. Pulsed infrared radiation (IR) has previously been shown to elicit responses in neurons. This study analyzes the response of neonatal rat spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons in vitro to IR (wavelength = 1,863 nm) using Ca(2+) imaging. Both types of neurons responded consistently with robust intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) transients that matched the low-frequency IR pulses applied (4 ms, 0.25-1 pps). Radiant exposures of ∼637 mJ/cm(2) resulted in continual neuronal activation. Temperature or [Ca(2+)] variations in the media did not alter the IR-evoked transients, ruling out extracellular Ca(2+) involvement or primary mediation by thermal effects on the plasma membrane. While blockage of Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) plasma membrane channels did not alter the IR-evoked response, blocking of mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling with CGP-37157 or ruthenium red reversibly inhibited the IR-evoked [Ca(2+)]i transients. Additionally, the magnitude of the IR-evoked transients was dependent on ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid-dependent Ca(2+) release. These results suggest that IR modulation of intracellular calcium cycling contributes to stimulation of spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons. As a whole, the results suggest selective excitation of neurons in the IR beam path and the potential of IR stimulation in future auditory and vestibular prostheses. ","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the usage of ""hearing loss"" pertains to a focus on screening methods to identify unrecognized hearing issues in the elderly, which implies a diagnostic and detection context relevant primarily to aging-related auditory health. In Text B, however, ""hearing loss"" is discussed in a highly technical and medical engineering context, emphasizing advanced treatment solutions such as cochlear implants and discussions of physiological responses to experimental treatments like IR stimulation for profound sensorineural hearing loss. This shift from a general health screening context to a detailed, research-focused context on innovative treatments shows that the term ""hearing loss"" has shifted in usage and focus, indicating a semantic drift towards a more specialized and technologically oriented discourse."

We could detect no EOE with hearing losses over 50 dB HL at 500 Hz, 40 dB HL at 1000 Hz, 50 dB HL at 2000 Hz and 85 dB HL at 4000 Hz. With a rate of middle hearing loss over 45 dB HL we also did not find EOE for the whole frequency range. On the base of this study, the authors conclude that EOE explore the functional integrity of those parts of the cochlea that correspond to the middle frequencies of hearing range.

Cochlear synaptopathy between HCs and spiral ganglion neurons has been gathering attention as a cochlear HC loss precursor not detectable by normal auditory evaluation. However, the molecular mechanisms linking ROS with HC loss, as well as the relationship between ROS and cochlear synaptopathy have not been elucidated. Here, we examined these linkages using NOX4-TG mice, which constitutively produce ROS without stimulation. mRNA levels of Piccolo 1, a major component of the synaptic ribbon (a specialized structure surrounded by synaptic vesicles in HCs), were decreased in postnatal day 6 NOX4-TG mice cochleae compared to those in WT mice; they were also decreased by noise exposure in 2-week-old WT cochleae. As noise exposure induces ROS production, this suggests that the synaptic ribbon is a target of ROS. The level of CtBP2, another synaptic ribbon component, was significantly lower in NOX4-TG cochleae of 1-month-old and 4-month-old mice compared to that in WT mice, although no significant differences were noted at 1.5- and 2-months. The decrease in CtBP2 plateaued in 4-month-old NOX4-TG, while it gradually decreased from 1 to 6 months in WT mice. Furthermore, CtBP2 level in 2-month-old NOX4-TG mice decreased significantly after exposure to cisplatin and noise compared to that in WT mice.

The relationship between functional gain and coupler gain was compared for the ITE and the higher rated OTE instruments. The difference in input received at the microphone locations of the two types of hearing aids was measured for 10 different subjects and compared to the functional gain data. It was concluded that (a) for persons with mild to moderately severe hearing losses, appropriately adjusted custom ITE fittings typically yield speech intelligibility that is equal to the better OTE fitting identified in a comparative evaluation; and (b) gain prescriptions for ITE hearing aids should be adjusted to account for the high-frequency emphasis associated with in-the-concha microphone placement.",To investigate the correlation between prothrombin G20210A polymorphism and the risk for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) using Meta-analysis methodology.,"- Label: Unchanged

49,Hearing loss,"Binaural performance is a general term that can be applied to a wide range of paradigms that involve listening with both ears. This review samples from across the spectrum of binaural tasks by highlighting recent studies that encapsulate certain aspects of binaural function. Studies of the precedence effect and binaural unmasking suggest that temporal coding in elderly listeners is degraded relative to young listeners and that this decline is not simply a function of reduced audiometric sensitivity. For higher tasks involving speech recognition in competing noise, the elderly show reduced binaural advantage, particularly when they also exhibit presbyacusic hearing loss. However, it should not be overlooked that the advantages of listening with two ears rather than one remain significant even in the presbyacusic listener.",Abstract   Usage of the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) with round window (RW)-Coupler placement at the RW has been shown to successfully treat mixed hearing loss. Coupling between the VSB's floating mass transducer (FMT) and the RW membrane is difficult in the case of sclerosis in the RW and drilling down the bony lip until the RW membrane can be seen completely can possibly induce a perilymphatic fistula. A 68-year-old woman who had bilateral mixed hearing loss with sclerosis in the RW due to tympanosclerosis underwent a RW-Vibroplasty with a RW-Coupler. Speech discrimination scores in quiet and noise and functional gain with the VSB with RW-Coupler were better than those using a conventional hearing aid. The results of the present case have shown the feasibility of implanting a VSB with RW-Coupler in patients with mixed hearing loss due to tympanosclerosis.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" is used to refer to a deficiency in hearing ability. Text A discusses ""presbyacusic hearing loss"" in elderly listeners in a context of binaural hearing function, emphasizing a decrease in hearing related to aging (presbyacusis). Text B describes a case of ""mixed hearing loss"" addressed through surgical intervention (Vibrant Soundbridge with round window placement) to help improve speech discrimination and hearing function. Despite discussing different types of hearing loss (age-related in Text A and mixed in Text B) and different approaches (observational vs. treatment-based), the fundamental concept of ""hearing loss"" as an impairment of hearing ability remains consistent across both texts. Thus, the usage and meaning of ""hearing loss"" have not undergone significant change or semantic drift over these time periods.

50,Hearing loss,"Hearing impairment is a common but not inevitable accompaniment of aging. It is partly due to the natural involution of irreplaceable neurones; environment also plays a large role. Although they may have difficulty in hearing all frequencies of sound, elderly people have particular difficulty with high-pitched sounds. They find it hard to focus on sounds, and serious social problems may arise as a result. Elderly people with hearing losses are particularly vulnerable to psychological sequelae, many of which are serious, but may also be correctable. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding of the causes of hearing handicaps, their prevalence, incidence and implications for the elderly, health professionals and the health care system.","  Improving the user's hearing ability to understand speech in noisy
environments is critical to the development of hearing aid (HA) devices. For
this, it is important to derive a metric that can fairly predict speech
intelligibility for HA users. A straightforward approach is to conduct a
subjective listening test and use the test results as an evaluation metric.
However, conducting large-scale listening tests is time-consuming and
expensive. Therefore, several evaluation metrics were derived as surrogates for
subjective listening test results. In this study, we propose a multi-branched
speech intelligibility prediction model (MBI-Net), for predicting the
subjective intelligibility scores of HA users. MBI-Net consists of two branches
of models, with each branch consisting of a hearing loss model, a cross-domain
feature extraction module, and a speech intelligibility prediction model, to
process speech signals from one channel. The outputs of the two branches are
fused through a linear layer to obtain predicted speech intelligibility scores.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of MBI-Net, which produces
higher prediction scores than the baseline system in Track 1 and Track 2 on the
Clarity Prediction Challenge 2022 dataset.

51,Hearing loss,"Screening for hearing loss should be part of the routine physical examination, but it is often not done because of time constraints. We present a quick and easy office screening test that measures the functional impact of hearing loss. We also review the steps of audiologic management that follow referral by the primary care physician.","Sensory hair cells are prone to apoptosis caused by various drugs including aminoglycoside antibiotics. In mammals, this vulnerability results in permanent hearing loss because lost hair cells are not regenerated. Conversely, hair cells regenerate in birds, making the avian inner ear an exquisite model for studying ototoxicity and regeneration. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and trajectory analysis on control and dying hair cells after aminoglycoside treatment. Interestingly, the two major subtypes of avian cochlear hair cells, tall and short hair cells, respond differently. Dying short hair cells show a noticeable transient upregulation of many more genes than tall hair cells. The most prominent gene group identified is associated with potassium ion conductances, suggesting distinct physiological differences. Moreover, the dynamic characterization of >15,000 genes expressed in tall and short avian hair cells during their apoptotic demise comprises a resource for further investigations toward mammalian hair cell protection and hair cell regeneration.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the usage of ""hearing loss"" focuses on the clinical aspect of detecting and managing hearing loss in humans, highlighting the importance of screening and subsequent audiological care. It presents hearing loss as a general health issue subject to medical evaluation and intervention. Conversely, Text B shifts the context to a biological and genetic viewpoint, concentrating on the reasons behind permanent hearing loss at a cellular level due to apoptosis in sensory hair cells, induced by external factors such as drugs. This passage explores the cellular reactions to damage and possibilities for regeneration, emphasizing a scientific research perspective rather than a clinical one. Thus, the semantic context of ""hearing loss"" has expanded from a pure health condition in humans to include detailed scientific insights into cellular mechanisms and genetic responses that could influence future therapeutic approaches. This demonstrates a significant expansion in the usage and implications of the term."
52,Hearing loss,"A survey of the children at the Robarts School for the Deaf was performed in order to determine the etiology of hearing loss, the reading ability as related to the degree of hearing loss, and the incidence of middle ear disease. The largest category for etiology was idiopathic at 31%, followed by hereditary at 22.5%, and maternal rubella at 19%. The incidence of serous otitis media was found to be 11%.","Acute appendicitis is considered one of the most common surgical emergencies with low morbidity and mortality. However, delay in the diagnosis may lead to perforation of the appendix. Hence, complications may arise, including necrotizing fasciitis, a rare complication of a perforated appendix. We present a case of perforated appendicitis complicated by necrotizing fasciitis leading to rapid deterioration. A 75-year-old male patient presented to our emergency room with a three-day history of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and abdominal distention. On admission, computed tomography (CT) scan showed a perforated appendix and peri-appendicular abscess. An exploratory laparotomy was performed. The appendix was resected and the wound closed. The patient was recovering well and tolerating food after the procedure. However, the patient developed progressive erythema/swelling over the right flank with new-onset leukocytosis. The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis was suspected and confirmed by careful evaluation and laboratory/radiological tests. Antibiotics were changed to clindamycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and the patient was taken back to the operation room (OR) for surgical debridement. Postoperatively, the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). He developed hearing impairment, which improved after the cessation of clindamycin. He was discharged in good condition after three weeks of hospital stay. This case report highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for necrotizing soft tissue infection in immunocompromised patients with perforated appendicitis and being cautious when prescribing clindamycin to patients at risk of hearing loss.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the discussion around ""hearing loss"" is focused on understanding its etiological origins (idiopathic, hereditary, rubella) and its correlation to other medical conditions (e.g., middle ear disease). The definition of ""hearing loss"" here relates directly to auditory capability without indicating transient or potentially reversible conditions caused by external factors like medications. In contrast, Text B introduces ""hearing loss"" as a temporary side effect of medication (clindamycin) used in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis, which was reversed upon cessation of the drug. This showcases a shift from viewing ""hearing loss"" predominantly as a permanent sensory deficit linked to intrinsic factors, to also including transient, medically induced auditory impairment as part of its definition, broadening the term's medical application and interpretation over time."
53,Hearing loss,"Some clinical data concerning the relationship between hyperlipidemia and sensorineural hearing loss have been reported, however, definite mechanism causing pathological changes in the cochlea and hearing loss has not yet been clarified. We studied the mechanism of hearing loss due to hyperlipidemia in rabbits by ABR hearing examination, biochemical study of the sera, observation of the inner ear morphology by Sem and Tem. We suggest that the decreased blood supply in the inner ear during hyperlipidemia because of increased platelet aggregation and blood viscosity may be responsible for the inner ear damage. At the same time, a high lipid peroxide level in the serum and the inner ear, as well as the metabolic disorder of lipids in the inner ear may also contribute to the development of hearing loss.",To evaluate non-linear frequency compression (NLFC) as a means to improve speech recognition for children with moderate to moderately-severe hearing loss following a six-month acclimatization period.,"- Label: Unchanged

55,Hearing loss,"High environmental and psychosocial stress contribute to the onset and relapse of major psychiatric disorders. High sound levels in general hospitals are common and may be indirectly associated with negative physical effects because of increased physiological stress on the body. Excessive sound also interferes with cognitive functioning, especially affecting prefrontal cortical processes, but no information about sound levels in psychiatric hospitals was available. This study critically examines literature on sound stress and reports findings from an exploratory study of sound levels in a tertiary care psychiatric hospital. An overall mean sound level of 75.68 dB was found, with peak sound levels as high as 85 to 90 dB, in the range that causes hearing loss. These levels, higher than sound levels on medical, surgical, and intensive care units, suggest the need for more attention to the effect that environmental sound has on the behavior of patients hospitalized with acute psychiatric symptoms.","MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA).

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" refers to the same condition characterized by the reduced ability to hear sounds. In Text A, hearing loss is discussed in the context of environmental factors, specifically high sound levels, which are known to damage hearing capabilities. Similarly, in Text B, hearing loss is described as a symptom of MELAS syndrome, indicating a dysfunction in auditory processing due to a genetic condition. The commonality in both texts is the reference to the impairment or loss of hearing, despite being caused by different factors (environmental vs. genetic). Thus, the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a decrease in hearing capability remains unchanged between the two texts.

57,Hearing loss,"One consequence of noise exposure is increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, in the cochlea. ROS can cause oxidative damage to diverse cellular components, including membranes, proteins, and DNA, if they are not ""neutralised"" by antioxidant defences. Two important enzymes of the cochlear antioxidant defense system are cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx1). These metalloenzymes work together to regulate ROS production in virtually every cell in the body, and they may be important for limiting cochlear damage associated with aging and acoustic overexposure. In this chapter, we describe a series of experiments using mice with targeted deletions of Sod1 or Gpx1, the mouse genes that code for SOD1 and GPx1, respectively, to study the cellular mechanisms underlying noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The results from Sod1 and Gpx1 knockout mice provide insights into the link between endogenous levels of antioxidant enzymes and susceptibility to NIHL.",Characterize hearing loss (HL) after hearing preservation cochlear implantation and determine the association between high charge electrical stimulation (ES) and late loss of acoustic hearing.,"###Label:

In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" retains a consistent core meaning concerning damage or deterioration of the ability to hear. Text A discusses the biological mechanisms and genetic factors contributing to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), emphasizing the cellular and biochemical impact on the cochlea leading to hearing loss. Text B, meanwhile, explores hearing loss in the context of cochlear implantation, focusing on the effects of electrical stimulation on residual hearing post-surgery. Despite differing details in terms of the specific causes or contexts (noise exposure versus surgical intervention), the fundamental concept of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing capability remains unchanged between the two texts. Both scenarios describe situations where the auditory capacity is compromised, albeit through different mechanisms or circumstances. Hence, the semantic meaning of ""hearing loss"" doesn't exhibit significant drift over the periods covered by the texts."
58,Hearing loss,"The incidence of hearing loss in early childhood is not exactly defined in the Federal Republic of Germany. There are only some publications on this problem giving incidental information. By analysing this sparse data we tried to determine whether in incidence of hearing loss also applies to the German region. It appears necessary that hearing loss is screened in Germany, considering that other diseases having a lower incidence are also screened.","The factors responsible for interindividual differences in speech-understanding ability among hearing-impaired listeners are not well understood. Although audibility has been found to account for some of this variability, other factors may play a role. This study sought to examine whether part of the large interindividual variability of speech-recognition performance in individuals with severe-to-profound high-frequency hearing loss could be accounted for by differences in hearing-loss onset type (early, progressive, or sudden), age at hearing-loss onset, or hearing-loss duration. Other potential factors including age, hearing thresholds, speech-presentation levels, and speech audibility were controlled. Percent-correct (PC) scores for syllables in dissyllabic words, which were either unprocessed or lowpass filtered at cutoff frequencies ranging from 250 to 2,000 Hz, were measured in 20 subjects (40 ears) with severe-to-profound hearing losses above 1 kHz. For comparison purposes, 20 normal-hearing subjects (20 ears) were also tested using the same filtering conditions and a range of speech levels (10-80 dB SPL). Significantly higher asymptotic PCs were observed in the early (<=4 years) hearing-loss onset group than in both the progressive- and sudden-onset groups, even though the three groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, hearing thresholds, or speech audibility. In addition, significant negative correlations between PC and hearing-loss onset age, and positive correlations between PC and hearing-loss duration were observed. These variables accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in speech-intelligibility scores than, and were not significantly correlated with, speech audibility, as quantified using a variant of the articulation index. Although the lack of statistical independence between hearing-loss onset type, hearing-loss onset age, hearing-loss duration, and age complicate and limit the interpretation of the results, these findings indicate that other variables than audibility can influence speech intelligibility in listeners with severe-to-profound high-frequency hearing loss.","### Label:

In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" consistently refers to the condition affecting auditory perception. Text A discusses hearing loss prevalence and the need for screenings in children, emphasizing its detection and importance in public health. Text B explores factors affecting speech recognition performance among individuals with hearing loss, considering various characteristics of their hearing loss such as onset timing and duration. Although the applications differ slightly—with Text A focusing on broader public health screening and Text B delving into specific factors influencing speech perception—the underlying meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing ability remains stable across both texts. There is no significant shift in how the term is used or understood between the two periods, thus showing that the semantic aspect of ""hearing loss"" has remained ""unchanged""."

- Reason: The term ""hearing loss"" in both Text A and Text B refers to a decrease in the ability to perceive sound, which directly ties to the impairment of auditory functions. In Text A, the hearing loss is associated with Waardenburg syndrome and described as a symptom of the genetic condition along with other phenotypic characteristics. In Text B, hearing loss is again linked to a genetic condition, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, emphasizing its role as a potential symptom resulting from genetic mutations affecting the auditory system. Therefore, despite being associated with different syndromes in each text, the underlying meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing capability remains consistent across the decades. Hence, the semantic meaning of the term has not drifted."
60,Hearing loss,"Otoacoustic emissions are sounds produced by outer hair cells of cochlea. It is known that they may be useful in assessing hearing loss. The aim of our study was to evaluate their diagnostic capability in separating sensory from neural hearing impairment. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TOAE) and distortion-product emissions (DP) were measured in 14 patients with sensorineural hearing loss. The results showed DP to be present in 12 patients and in 8 of them TOAE were detected despite the mild to severe hearing loss, thus indicating the lesion should be retrocochlear. The recording of otoacoustic emissions appears to be a technique for precise etiological diagnosis of hearing impairment.","Hearing loss is among the most frequent problems experienced by older adults, yet psychiatrists and other clinicians often ignore the problem as an aggravation rather than recognizing that the problem might benefit from appropriate hearing health care.

61,Hearing loss,"The present study was a systematic investigation of the benefit of providing hearing-impaired listeners with audible high-frequency speech information. Five normal-hearing and nine high-frequency hearing-impaired listeners identified nonsense syllables that were low-pass filtered at a number of cutoff frequencies. As a means of quantifying audibility for each condition, Articulation Index (AI) was calculated for each condition for each listener. Most hearing-impaired listeners demonstrated an improvement in speech recognition as additional audible high-frequency information was provided. In some cases for more severely impaired listeners, increasing the audibility of high-frequency speech information resulted in no further improvement in speech recognition, or even decreases in speech recognition. A new measure of how well hearing-impaired listeners used information within specific frequency bands called ""efficiency"" was devised. This measure compared the benefit of providing a given increase in speech audibility to a hearing-impaired listener to the benefit observed in normal-hearing listeners for the same increase in speech audibility. Efficiencies were calculated using the old AI method and the new AI method (which takes into account the effects of high speech presentation levels). There was a clear pattern in the results suggesting that as the degree of hearing loss at a given frequency increased beyond 55 dB HL, the efficacy of providing additional audibility to that frequency region was diminished, especially when this degree of hearing loss was present at frequencies of 4000 Hz and above. A comparison of analyses from the ""old"" and ""new"" AI procedures suggests that some, but not all, of the deficiencies of speech recognition in these listeners was due to high presentation levels.","Mutations in the gene encoding the type II transmembrane protease 3 (TMPRSS3) cause human hearing loss, although the underlying mechanisms that result in TMPRSS3-related hearing loss are still unclear. We combined the use of stem cell-derived inner ear organoids with single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the role of TMPRSS3. Defective Tmprss3 leads to hair cell apoptosis without altering the development of hair cells and the formation of the mechanotransduction apparatus. Prior to degeneration, Tmprss3-KO hair cells demonstrate reduced numbers of BK channels and lower expressions of genes encoding calcium ion-binding proteins, suggesting a disruption in intracellular homeostasis. A proteolytically active TMPRSS3 was detected on cell membranes in addition to ER of cells in inner ear organoids. Our in vitro model recapitulated salient features of genetically associated inner ear abnormalities and will serve as a powerful tool for studying inner ear disorders.","###Answer:

  - The usage of ""hearing loss"" has shifted from a clinical and technological perspective centered on managing the condition with auditory devices (Text A) to a more detailed genetic and molecular perspective, investigating the fundamental biological causes and mechanisms underneath (Text B).
  - This shift reflects the broader evolution in the field from primarily symptom management and compensatory strategies towards a deeper understanding of the genetic and cellular basis of the disorder, which opens paths for potentially targeting the condition at its root causes rather than just managing symptoms. Therefore, the word ""hearing loss"" has undergone semantic drift, encompassing both external interventions and intrinsic biological factors influencing the condition."
62,Hearing loss,"The cause of noise-induced hearing loss remains unclear despite years of both epidemiologic and experimental investigation. Among the many possible pathophysiologic mechanisms that may contribute to noise-induced temporary or permanent threshold shifts are insufficiencies in cochlear blood flow. Although the literature is inconsistent, several histologic and physiologic studies demonstrate signs of reduced circulation in the cochlea after noise exposure. Recent studies using computer-enhanced intravital microscopy complement these earlier findings. Evidence suggests that these microcirculatory events are mediated in part by several circulating factors, including the potent vasoactive peptide angiotensin. This study investigated this possibility by pretreating with the angiotensin receptor antagonist sarthran during noise exposure and examining both cochlear microcirculation and auditory sensitivity. The results of these experiments show noise-induced ischemia in the lateral wall of the cochlea and temporary threshold shifts. Treatment with sarthran prevented this noise-induced microcirculatory ischemia and preserved auditory sensitivity at the low frequencies tested. These findings support a role for the angiotensinergic system during noise exposure and suggest that preservation of cochlear blood flow is functionally related to auditory sensitivity.","It is well known that head trauma may cause hearing loss, which can be either conductive or sensorineural. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and olfactory dysfunction due to head trauma are also well known. The association between sensorineural hearing loss and anosmia, following head trauma, is extremely rare. Two rare cases of post-traumatic occurrence of hearing loss, olfactory dysfunction and benign positional vertigo are reported and the pathophysiology of the association between sensorineural hearing loss, anosmia and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, after head injury, are briefly discussed. ENT specialists should, in the authors' opinion, be aware of the possible association between anosmia, sensorineural hearing loss and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo after head injury, even in the absence of skull fracture.","- Label: Unchanged

63,Hearing loss,"Progressive hearing loss affects approximately 50% of the elderly by the age of 80, and is most likely caused by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Identification of the genes responsible for hereditary hearing loss is therefore important. Families with pure genetic degenerative hearing disorders may be helpful as the same genes may be also involved in age-related hearing loss in general. In this study we have performed a genome search in an extended Dutch family with autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss starting in the high frequencies. The gene causing hearing loss in this family was localized to the short arm of chromosome 7, in a 15 cM interval between markers D7S493 and D7S632.","Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown origin affecting up to 1% of the population. Little is known about audiovestibular impairment in patients with AS, especially the presence of cochleovestibular dysfunction in these patients. To investigate audiovestibular manifestations in AS, we studied a series of 50 consecutive patients who fulfilled the modified New York diagnostic criteria for AS and 44 matched controls. Individuals with history of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular complications, peripheral artery disease, renal insufficiency, syphilis, Meniere and other vestibular syndromes, infections involving the inner ear, barotrauma, or in treatment with ototoxic drugs were excluded. Most patients with AS were men (80%). The mean age at the time of study was 52.5 years, and mean age at the onset of symptoms was 34.4 years. Twenty-nine (58%) patients showed abnormal hearing loss in the audiogram compared to only 8 (18%) controls (p < 0.001). Values of audiometric tests (pure-tone average and speech reception threshold) yielded significant differences between patients and controls (p < 0.001). It is noteworthy that the audiogram shape disclosed a predominant pattern of high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in AS patients (50%) compared to controls (18%) (p = 0.002). Also, AS patients exhibited abnormal vestibular tests more commonly than controls. AS patients had an increased frequency of head-shaking nystagmus (20%) compared to controls (0%) (p < 0.001). Moreover, patients (26%) showed a significantly increased frequency of abnormal caloric test compared to controls (0%) (p < 0.001). Finally, a significantly increased frequency of abnormal clinical test of sensory integration and balance with a predominant vestibular loss pattern was observed in patients (36%) compared to controls (5%) (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the current study demonstrates strong evidence for inner ear compromise in patients with AS.","### Answer:

Text A discusses the implications of hearing loss on career maturity and transitions in adolescents, focusing on a socio-economic aspect, while Text B deals with a genetic study concerning the hereditary nature of sensorineural hearing loss. Despite the different contexts (socio-professional impact in Text A vs. genetic research in Text B), the underlying meaning of ""hearing loss"" regarding the impairment of hearing ability remains constant across both texts. There is no significant change in the way the term ""hearing loss"" is used or understood between these texts."
65,Hearing loss,"Throughout the last two decades, we have witnessed a gradual change in the audiological profile of the hearing-impaired child. The number of children with severe to profound hearing losses seems to be declining, while those with minimal losses seems to be increasing. Such losses include unilateral sensorineural, mild bilateral sensorineural, and bilateral conductive hearing loss. Historically, children with minimal hearing loss have received limited attention from physicians, audiologists, or educators. It has been assumed that minimally hearing-impaired children will exhibit few, if any, handicaps and require no special assistance in the academic setting. Recent evidence challenges that assumption, however, and suggests that, in fact, children with minimal hearing loss can demonstrate significant academic and communicative difficulties. It is recommended that children with minimal hearing impairment be considered at high risk for communication and educational difficulties and that assessments be made early in order to identify problems and implement management programs.","Age-related hearing loss is manifested primarily by a decreased sensitivity to faint sounds, that is, by elevation of the hearing thresholds. Nevertheless, aging also affects the ability of the auditory system to process temporal parameters of the sound stimulus. To explore the precision and reliability of auditory temporal processing during aging, responses to several types of sound stimuli were recorded from neurons of the auditory cortex (AC) of young and aged anaesthetized Fischer 344 rats. In response to broad-band noise bursts, the aged rats exhibited larger response magnitudes, a higher proportion of monotonic units, and also a larger variability of response magnitudes, suggesting a lower stability of the rate code. Of primary interest were the responses to temporally structured stimuli (amplitude-modulated (AM) noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, and click trains) recorded separately in the right and left AC. Significant differences of temporal processing were already found between the neuronal responses in the left and right AC in the young animals: for the click trains, the left hemisphere exhibited a greater responsiveness to higher repetition rates, lower vector strength values, and a lower similarity of responses. The two hemispheres were also affected differently by aging. In the right hemisphere, neurons in the aged animals displayed worse synchronization with the AM noise and clicks, but better synchronization with the FM tone. In the left hemisphere, neuronal synchronization with the stimulus modulation improved at a higher age for all three stimuli. The results show that the ability of the aging auditory system to process temporal parameters of the stimulus strongly depends on the stimulus type and on laterality. Furthermore, the commonly reported age-related decline in the temporal processing ability cannot be regarded as general as, at least at the neuronal level in the AC, objective measures of the temporal representation often exhibit age-related improvement instead of deterioration.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" retains its fundamental meaning related to the impairment of the ability to hear sounds. Text A focuses on hearing loss in children, discussing various degrees of impairment and the impact on academic and communicative abilities. Text B examines age-related hearing loss in an animal model, focusing on the physiological and neuronal changes associated with auditory processing as age progresses. While the contexts and specifics of the hearing loss (child vs. age-related, human vs. animal model) differ, the core concept of ""hearing loss"" as a decrease in hearing ability remains consistent between the two periods. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""hearing loss"" does not exhibit significant drift but rather expands in the dimension of its discussion concerning different ages and scientific understanding."
66,Hearing loss,"Speech perception is a valuable tool for the assessment of auditory (re-)habilitation of children with hearing impairments. We tested 3 groups of prelingually deaf children. For the evaluation of speech recognition abilities the test of auditory perception of speech in children (TAPS) was used. Hearing aid fitted children of a school for hard of hearing and school of the deaf (n = 12 and n = 10, respectively) and cochlear implant users (n = 12) of the same age group were tested. A positive correlation of the speech perception abilities with the aided thresholds was found. Hearing aid fitted children of the school of hard of hearing with aided thresholds between 20 and 40 dB HL including 4000 Hz showed best results. Students of the same school with aided thresholds in the range of 45 to 70 dB HL performed comparable to the lesser cochlear implant users fitted with a single channel analogue system. Hearing aid fitted students of a school for the deaf with the same degree of hearing loss and amplification showed significantly poorer results.",Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an important occupational disease which results from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors.

67,Hearing loss,"The difference in the hearing threshold before and after treatment with cis-diaminnedichloroplatinum (DDP) is analysed in 69 patients. Hearing loss due to DDP treatment is mainly limited to 8,000 Hz and the incidence is about 40%. The effect of DDP is dose-related, although even at the lowest dose 20% of the patients are affected. The age of the patients is not an important factor. Loss of hearing due to DDP treatment occurs independent of any pre-existent hearing loss although those patients with great pre-existent hearing loss do not show a further loss. Of the patients with hearing loss, 39% show a difference of 20 dB or more between the left and the right ear. Hearing loss due to DDP is of minor importance compared with many of the other side-effects of DDP.","(1) Background: To improve hearing-aid rehabilitation, the Danish 'Better hEAring Rehabilitation' (BEAR) project recently developed methods for individual hearing loss characterization and hearing-aid fitting. Four auditory profiles differing in terms of audiometric hearing loss and supra-threshold hearing abilities were identified. To enable auditory profile-based hearing-aid treatment, a fitting rationale leveraging differences in gain prescription and signal-to-noise (SNR) improvement was developed. This report describes the translation of this rationale to clinical devices supplied by three industrial partners. (2) Methods: Regarding the SNR improvement, advanced feature settings were proposed and verified based on free-field measurements made with an acoustic mannikin fitted with the different hearing aids. Regarding the gain prescription, a clinically feasible fitting tool and procedure based on real-ear gain adjustments were developed. (3) Results: Analyses of the collected real-ear gain and SNR improvement data confirmed the feasibility of the clinical implementation. Differences between the auditory profile-based fitting strategy and a current 'best practice' procedure based on the NAL-NL2 fitting rule were verified and are discussed in terms of limitations and future perspectives. (4) Conclusion: Based on a joint effort from academic and industrial partners, the BEAR fitting rationale was transferred to commercially available hearing aids.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the use of the term ""hearing loss"" primarily refers to a medical condition specifically induced by treatment with a certain drug (DDP), generally described in a clinical context focusing on the side effects of a medication. The emphasis is on analyzing hearing loss as a negative outcome of chemotherapy with an explanation of its characteristics like frequency specificity and dose-related impact. In contrast, Text B shifts the context to a more technical and rehabilitative focus, discussing ""hearing loss"" in the realm of improving hearing aid technology and individualizing treatment. Here, ""hearing loss"" is not merely seen as a condition to be diagnosed but also as a variable to be effectively managed and accommodated through advanced technological solutions. The semantic drift is marked by a transition from a clinical symptom to be treated or mitigated in a purely medical framework, to a condition that involves detailed characterization for tailored technological intervention in audiology. Thus, between the two timeframes, ""hearing loss"" has evolved from a strictly medical framework to encompass technological advancements, indicating a clear semantic shift in usage and perception."
68,Hearing loss,"The role of disturbances of the iron metabolism (DIM) in idiopathic sudden hearing loss (ISHL) was investigated in 426 patients with ISHL who received iron therapy, anti-DIM medication, vitamins, and a combined regimen in a randomized study which was stratified by stages and groups. Low concentrations of haemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, and red cell basic ferritin as well as abnormal circadian variations in the serum iron level were observed. The results were significantly better in patients receiving iron therapy than in those receiving anti-DIM medication, vitamins, and the combined regimen. Hearing improvement was achieved in 53.26% of the patients whose treatment started later than 3 months after the onset of the disease.

70,Hearing loss,"We report two clinical and five histopathological examples of labyrinthitis ossificans and discuss the possible cause of this condition. Diagnosis can be established by polytomography. The advent of the cochlear implant makes ossification of the cochlea (labyrinthitis ossificans) of more than academic interest, since it requires alteration of the insertion of an electrode into the scala tympani and minimizes the chances of successful stimulation. Hearing losses due to meningitis, advanced cochlear otosclerosis, and trauma are likely to be due to cochlear ossification. Therefore, it is important to rule out this condition by means of polytomography in individuals being considered for cochlear implant surgery.","To evaluate the association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among a national sample cohort from Korea. Data were collected from 2002 through 2013 for individuals aged ≥ 20 years in the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-National Sample Cohort. We extracted the data from RA patients (n = 7619) and 1:4-matched controls (n = 30,476) and analyzed the occurrence of SSNHL. Matching was performed based on age, sex, income, region of residence, and medical history. RA was diagnosed based on International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes (M05 or M06) and prescriptions for the antirheumatic drugs. SSNHL was diagnosed based on the relevant ICD-10 code (H912). Among the SSNHL participants, we included only those who had undergone an audiometry exam (claim codes: E6931-E6937, F6341-F6348) and received treatment with steroids. The crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox-proportional hazard models, and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Subgroup analyses based on age and sex were also performed. The rate of SSNHL in the RA group (0.8% [62/7619]) was higher than that in the control group (0.6% [177/30,476], P = 0.021). The crude and adjusted HRs for SSNHL were 1.40 (95% CI = 1.05-1.87) and 1.39 (95% CI = 1.04-1.86), respectively, in the RA group (each P < 0.05).

71,Hearing loss,"A multiphase study examining electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) between wireless digital telephones and hearing aids has been under way at the University of Oklahoma EMC Center since May 1995. In a phase 1 clinical study involving 68 hearing aid wearers, interference varied significantly by telephone technology, hearing aid type, and hearing loss characteristics. More than 80 percent of the tests resulted in either no interference or a detection threshold distance less than 1 meter. Metallic shielding of the units yielded positive results. Various elements of phase 2 involved instrument-based tests of hearing aid interference using telephones in a sound-isolation chamber and radio frequency signals in a waveguide, along with clinical studies of speech-to-interference ratios, all leading to the development of standards of measurement and performance criteria for telephone emissions and hearing aid immunity. Results to date confirm that bystander interference is of less concern than user interference, which is the focus of continuing research.","The vast majority of sensorineural hearing loss is caused by impairment of the inner ear cells. Proteomic analysis of perilymph may therefore improve our understanding of inner ear diseases and hearing loss. However, the investigation of the human perilymph proteome was limited due to technical difficulties in perilymph sampling. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is frequently used as an experimental model in preclinical hearing research. In this study, we analyzed samples of perilymph collected from 12 guinea pigs to overcome limited experimental information regarding its proteome. We identified a total of 1413 proteins, establishing a greatly expanded proteome of the previously inferred guinea pig perilymph. This provides a comprehensive proteomic resource for the research community, which will facilitate future molecular-phenotypic studies using the guinea pig as an experimental model of relevance to human inner ear biology.","- Label: Unchanged

72,Hearing loss,"Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) are affected by stroke or migraine in the vertebrobasilar arterial system. Some studies have reported BAEP changes in vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), but others have shown no alterations. We recorded BAEPs in 35 patients with TIAs in the vertebrobasilar system who did not have a stroke, other neurologic disease or significant hearing loss. Thirty patients were recorded after resolution of symptoms, while five individuals still had some resolving signs or symptoms. TIA patients as a group had longer interpeak latencies, but I-III, III-V, and I-V latencies were not significantly longer than in controls. Wave V was significantly longer in latency and lower in amplitude in TIA patients, however. The patients whose TIAs had resolved at absolute and interpeak latencies were within normal limits, but three of five had interpeak latencies at or above three standard deviations beyond the normal mean in the still symptomatic group. One of these was later tested and found to be within normal limits. BAEPs after subsidence of symptoms may add little to the evaluation of vertebrobasilar ischemia, but further AEP analysis may show more definitive differences of diagnostic use. The occasional BAEP abnormality during the resolving transient ischemia supports the recently suggested continuum between ischemia and infarction in the vertebrobasilar territory.","PROBLEM/OBJECTIVES: Permanent childhood hearing loss has major negative impacts on children's health and development. To improve outcomes, universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has been implemented widely. However, high-quality evidence on its efficacy was lacking. To address this evidence gap, we conducted the Longitudinal Outcomes of Children with Hearing Impairment (LOCHI) study to directly compare outcomes of early- and late-identified children. This paper investigates whether early performance measured shortly after initial amplification predicts language development at 3 years of age.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""hearing loss"" is discussed in the context of research on brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) where ""hearing loss"" is mentioned as a condition absent in the patients being studied to avoid confounding factors. Here, the term mainly serves as a medical condition that could influence the results of neuropsychological diagnostic tests. The focus is primarily on the absence of hearing loss as a criterion for participation in the study.

  On the other hand, Text B focuses on the long-term developmental impacts and societal initiatives like universal newborn hearing screening aimed at addressing and mitigating ""hearing loss"" from a public health perspective. The emphasis is on the implications of early detection and intervention on improving language and developmental outcomes in children, portraying ""hearing loss"" as a crucial factor affecting childhood development.

  The semantic drift is evident where Text A treats hearing loss as an exclusionary clinical condition in diagnostic research, while Text B discusses the broader community and developmental implications, aiming towards proactive public health measures. Thus, the usage and connotation of ""hearing loss"" have shifted to encompass a more holistic view regarding its impact on overall child development and community health strategies."
73,Hearing loss,"At the ENT clinic in Luanda, Angola, 110 consecutive cases of children with chronic otitis media (COM) were studied to find out some clinical characteristics regarding age of onset and duration of otorrhea as well as the general state of health of the children. Eighty-five percent of the children had had longstanding otorrhea. In 75% of all the cases ear discharge had started during early childhood. It was possible to institute a simple conservative treatment of COM. Fifty percent returned to the clinic for a follow-up. The majority of the children came from families who lived under fairly good social conditions. One-hundred and five children with sensorineural hearing loss consulted the clinic. Many of them had had their hearing loss for several years before coming to the clinic. The etiology was in 39 cases infectious disease, meningitis being the most common one. Seventy-two percent had severe to profound hearing loss. Children with slight to moderate hearing loss rarely appeared at the clinic.

We previously mapped a locus (ahl8) contributing to the progressive hearing loss of DBA/2J (D2) mice and later showed that a missense variant of the Fscn2 gene, unique to the D2 inbred strain, was responsible for the ahl8 effect. Although ahl8 can explain much of the hearing loss difference between C57BL/6J (B6) and D2 strain mice, other loci also contribute. Here, we present results of our linkage analyses to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that modify the severity of hearing loss associated with the D2 strain Fscn2 (ahl8) allele. We searched for modifier loci by analyzing 31 BXD recombinant inbred (RI) lines fixed for the predisposing D2-derived Fscn2 (ahl8/ahl8) genotype and found a statistically significant linkage association of threshold means with a QTL on Chr 5, which we designated M5ahl8. The highest association (LOD 4.6) was with markers at the 84-90 Mb position of Chr 5, which could explain about 46 % of the among-RI strain variation in auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold means. The semidominant nature of the modifying effect of M5ahl8 on the Fscn2 (ahl8/ahl8) phenotype was demonstrated by analysis of a backcross involving D2 and B6.D2-Chr11D/LusJ strain mice. The Chr 5 map position of M5ahl8 and the D2 origin of its susceptibility allele correspond to Tmc1m4, a previously reported QTL that modifies outer hair cell degeneration in Tmc1 (Bth) mutant mice, suggesting that M5ahl8 and Tmc1m4 may represent the same gene affecting maintenance of stereocilia structure and function during aging.

74,Hearing loss,"Frequency modulation (FM) technology can significantly improve the speech perception ability of individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in background noise. Previous investigations have demonstrated that the microphone design of the FM transmitter can have a significant impact on this improved speech perception. The purpose of this investigation was to compare 3 types of FM transmitter microphone designs: (a) wide angle (omnidirectional microphone), which amplifies sounds coming from all directions around the microphone equally; (b) zoom (1 directional microphone), which provides less amplification to signals coming from the rear, and (c) superzoom (2 directional microphones), which provides less amplification to signals originating from the rear and the sides. Fifteen adults with bilateral slight to moderately severe SNHL participated. Speech perception was assessed using the Hearing in Noise Test (M. Nilsson, S. Soli, and J. Sullivan, 1994). Speech spectrum shaped noise served as the noise competition. Results revealed that the best speech perception in noise was obtained when the FM transmitter was used in the zoom setting. The poorest performance was obtained when the FM transmitter was in the wide-angle mode. The clinical implications of these results are discussed.","Verheij syndrome (VRJS) is a rare craniofacial spliceosomopathy presenting with craniofacial dysmorphism, multiple congenital anomalies and variable neurodevelopmental delay. It is caused by single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in PUF60 or interstitial deletions of the 8q24.3 region. PUF60 encodes a splicing factor which forms part of the spliceosome. To date, 36 patients with a sole diagnosis of VRJS due to disease-causing PUF60 SNVs have been reported in peer-reviewed publications. Although the depth of their phenotyping has varied greatly, they exhibit marked phenotypic heterogeneity. We report 10 additional unrelated patients, including the first described patients of Khmer, Indian, and Vietnamese ethnicities, and the eldest patient to date, with 10 heterozygous PUF60 variants identified through exome sequencing, 8 previously unreported. All patients underwent deep phenotyping identifying variable dysmorphism, growth delay, neurodevelopmental delay, and multiple congenital anomalies, including several unique features. The eldest patient is the only reported individual with a germline variant and neither neurodevelopmental delay nor intellectual disability. In combining these detailed phenotypic data with that of previously reported patients (n = 46), we further refine the known frequencies of features associated with VRJS. These include neurodevelopmental delay/intellectual disability (98%), axial skeletal anomalies (74%), appendicular skeletal anomalies (73%), oral anomalies (68%), short stature (66%), cardiac anomalies (63%), brain malformations (48%), hearing loss (46%), microcephaly (41%), colobomata (38%), and other ocular anomalies (65%).

75,Hearing loss,"Several neurotrophins and their receptors regulate the survival of vestibular and cochlear neurons and probably also the efferent and autonomic neurons that innervate the inner ear. Mice lacking either brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or its associated receptor, TrkB, lose all innervation to the semicircular canals and have reduced innervation of the outer hair cells in the apical and middle turns of the cochlea. Mice lacking neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or its receptor, TrkC, lose many spiral ganglion cells predominantly in the basal turn of the cochlea. Nerve fibers from spiral ganglion cells in the middle turn extended to inner hair cells of the base. In mice lacking both BDNF and NT-3, or both TrkB and TrkC, there is a complete loss of innervation to the inner ear. Thus, these two neurotrophins and their associated receptors have been shown to be absolutely necessary for the normal development of afferent innervation of the inner ear. Current research efforts are testing the therapeutic potential for neurotrophins to treat hearing loss.","Hearing loss, both sensorineural and conductive, is a well-recognized manifestation of systemic vasculitis, yet has only infrequently been described as its initial presentation. We describe three cases in which hearing loss preceded the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis by a period of a few weeks to more than 6 months. While steroid therapy was initiated immediately in one of the cases, comprehensive immunosuppressive therapy was given only after additional manifestations compatible with vasculitis appeared, allowing for a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis in two of the cases and undifferentiated vasculitis, in the third. Hearing improved in all patients, albeit, residual dysfunction remained. Prompt referral for a complete rheumatologic workup in cases of unexplained hearing loss would allow for a timely diagnosis of a collagen vascular disease and facilitate early initiation of systemic therapy, possibly yielding better audiological results.","###Answer:

###Reason:
The use of the term ""hearing loss"" in both Text A and Text B refers essentially to the impairment of hearing function. In Text A from an earlier time, the focus is on the biological and genetic foundations influencing hearing loss, particularly how certain neurotrophins and receptors are crucial for the development of the inner ear and hearing capabilities. Meanwhile, Text B from a later time discusses hearing loss as a clinical symptom of systemic vasculitis, showcasing how hearing loss can manifest in medical conditions and can precede even more serious diagnoses like systemic vasculitis. Although the contexts differ—Text A discussing genetic and development aspects, and Text B showcasing it as related to a disease symptom—the term ""hearing loss"" consistently refers to the reduction or decline in hearing ability across both texts. Thus, the essential meaning of ""hearing loss"" remains unchanged over time, focusing still on the impairment or decrease in hearing function regardless of the underlying cause."
76,Hearing loss,"Based on the examination of 249 consecutive patients, the usefulness of brain-stem response audiometry in a major audiological clinic was evaluated. Auditory brain-stem responses were performed either for hearing threshold determination (67 patients) or for assessment of retrocochlear hearing loss (182 patients). The results demonstrate that ABR is a reliable method for the estimation of hearing thresholds in non-cooperative subjects. The rate of false positives was 5% and no false negatives were found. In combination with caloric testing, ABR is considered a valuable testing procedure in the audiological clinic and it may form the basis for submission to brain imaging examination when a suspicion of retrocochlear hearing disorder is raised. Concerning the diagnosis of retrocochlear hearing disorder, no false negatives have yet been found, while a rate of 13% of false positives has been indicated.","This project was undertaken to develop automated tests of speech recognition, including speech-recognition threshold (SRT) and word-recognition test, using forced-choice responses and computerized scoring of responses. Specific aims were (1) to develop an automated method for measuring SRT for spondaic words that produces scores that are in close agreement with average pure-tone thresholds and (2) to develop an automated test of word recognition that distinguishes listeners with normal hearing from those with sensorineural hearing loss and which informs the hearing aid evaluation process.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The term ""hearing loss"" in both Text A and Text B remains primarily focused on the impairment of hearing ability, whether due to issues within the auditory brain-stem or sensorineural factors. Text A discusses the use of audiometry to assess retrocochlear hearing loss and provide a reliable estimation of hearing thresholds. Text B, while involving more advanced automated testing technologies, also focuses on the ability to distinguish between normal hearing and sensorineural hearing loss. Both texts use the word to denote a reduction in hearing ability, and the essential meaning of ""hearing loss"" has not shifted or drifted significantly between the different years of the texts. Each text relates to the diagnostic evaluation of hearing impairments reaffirming that the semantic context remains consistent and focused on hearing impairment itself."
77,Hearing loss,"Caspase-3 is one of the cystein proteases that play essential roles in programmed cell death. As such, brain development is profoundly affected by caspase-3-deficiency, resulting in hyperplasia and abnormal cell organization (Kuida et al., Nature 1996;384:368-372). In the present study, we used caspase-3 (-/-) mice to show that caspase-3 deficiency results in severe hearing loss, hyperplasia of supporting cells and degeneration of sensory hair cells. The greater epithelial ridge, a remnant of the primordial organ of Corti, persists throughout all of the turns of cochlea in 2-week-old caspase-3 (-/-) mice, which indicates that the morphology of the cochlea is immature. The number of border cells, that develop from the greater epithelial ridge and are one of the supporting cells of the inner hair cell, increase significantly in both 2- and 5-week-old caspase-3 (-/-) mice. On the other hand, abnormal fused stereocilia can be seen in both 2- and 5-week-old caspase-3 (-/-) mice, and disarrangement and loss of sensory hair cells are observed in 5-week-old caspase-3 (-/-) mice. Taken together, both hyperplasia and degeneration occur simultaneously in the inner ear of the caspase-3 (-/-) mice, suggesting that caspase-3-dependent apoptosis is necessary for the development and formation of a properly functioning auditory system in mammals.","Severe neurologic complications following epidural and spinal anesthesia rarely occur.

Though the insertions of the epidural and spinal catheters were smooth, she experienced back pain and transient hearing loss during epidural anesthesia. Postoperatively, she exhibited severe motor weakness in both lower extremities, neuralgia below the level of Th10 dermatome, and urinary retention. Magnetic resonance imaging showed longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis from T6 to T10 with a ring-shaped enhanced lesion and an isolated pontine lesion. These findings on magnetic resonance imaging were suggestive of autoimmune diseases such as neuromyelitis optica. The patient was diagnosed with an immunoreactive disease triggered by epidural or spinal anesthesia and was administered high-dose methylprednisolone, which led to the improvement in clinical symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of the development of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and isolated pontine lesions after cesarean section under epidural and spinal anesthesia.","- Label: Unchanged

78,Hearing loss,"This report summarizes audiologic and temporal bone findings in a 47-year-old white female with recurrent attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, and bilateral hearing loss. A series of audiograms, obtained over a 15-year period, showed a fluctuating mixed (sensorineural and conductive) hearing loss with a relatively flat configuration in the left ear and a relatively stable, mild sensorineural loss with a sloping contour in the right ear. Temporal bone studies revealed the existence of otosclerotic foci bilaterally. In the left ear, the otosclerotic focus has grown close to the utricular and lateral ampullary nerves, displaced and ankylosed the stapedial footplate, invaded the endosteal zone (1,000-2,000 Hz area), and deformed the lateral cochlear wall. In the right ear, the otosclerotic invasion was limited to the inferior portion on the promontory (vestibular cecum) and round window niche.",An effective and sustainable hearing loss (HL) screening strategy for the early detection of and intervention for HL in older adults is needed.,"###Answer:

79,Hearing loss,"Meniere's disease is an inner ear disease in which the symptom cluster of hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness is found along with attacks of vertigo and nausea. In this study, 20 subjects diagnosed with Meniere's disease completed daily measures of stress and symptoms during periods ranging between 45 and 351 days (M = 193.5). Data were analyzed by means of time-series analysis (ARIMA), and the temporal associations were investigated by lagged correlations. The results showed concurrent (same day) associations between stress and symptoms, but individual differences were found regarding which symptoms were associated with stress. Although stress is linked with symptom perception, this study does not support the role of stress as a precursor of symptoms in Meniere's disease.","THE READING LEVELS of a population of 93 Spanish deaf students were examined.

They were evaluated with sentence and text comprehension subtests from the Evaluation of Reading Processes of Primary Education Students, whose Spanish acronym is PROLEC (Cuetos, Rodríguez, & Ruano, 1996). A questionnaire on reading attitude was also used (Espín, 1987). Study results were consistent with those of previous research: Deaf students, at the end of their primary school education (mean age 13 years), have reading levels similar to or lower than the reading levels of hearing students at the onset of primary school education (mean age 7 years).

80,Hearing loss,This study was designed to measure the ability of listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss to discriminate silent gaps between noise band markers of different frequencies presented in an anechoic and a reverberant listening environment.,"Otosclerosis is a common form of progressive hearing loss, characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the otic capsule. The etiology of the disease is largely unknown, and both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated. To identify genetic factors involved in otosclerosis, we used a case-control discovery group to complete a genome-wide association (GWA) study with 555,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), utilizing pooled DNA samples. By individual genotyping of the top 250 SNPs in a stepwise strategy, we were able to identify two highly associated SNPs that replicated in two additional independent populations. We then genotyped 79 tagSNPs to fine map the two genomic regions defined by the associated SNPs. The region with the strongest association signal, p(combined) = 6.23 x 10(-10), is on chromosome 7q22.1 and spans intron 1 to intron 4 of reelin (RELN), a gene known for its role in neuronal migration. Evidence for allelic heterogeneity was found in this region. Consistent with the GWA data, expression of RELN was confirmed in the inner ear and in stapes footplate specimens. In conclusion, we provide evidence that implicates RELN in the pathogenesis of otosclerosis.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" is used in the context of a decline in the auditory function. Text A discusses hearing loss as a symptom in a medical condition (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), suggesting a health-related diminution of hearing ability arising as a symptom of a disease. Text B discusses hearing loss in the context of occupational hazards (noise-induced hearing loss among railway workers), but it similarly maintains the fundamental usage in terms of a decline in hearing capability due to external factors.

82,Hearing loss,"Articulation index (AI) theory was used to evaluate stop-consonant recognition of normal-hearing listeners and listeners with high-frequency hearing loss. From results reported in a companion article [Dubno et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 85, 347-354 (1989)], a transfer function relating the AI to stop-consonant recognition was established, and a frequency importance function was determined for the nine stop-consonant-vowel syllables used as test stimuli. The calculations included the rms and peak levels of the speech that had been measured in 1/3 octave bands; the internal noise was estimated from the thresholds for each subject. The AI model was then used to predict performance for the hearing-impaired listeners. A majority of the AI predictions for the hearing-impaired subjects fell within +/- 2 standard deviations of the normal-hearing listeners' results. However, as observed in previous data, the AI tended to overestimate performance of the hearing-impaired listeners. The accuracy of the predictions decreased with the magnitude of high-frequency hearing loss. Thus, with the exception of performance for listeners with severe high-frequency hearing loss, the results suggest that poorer speech recognition among hearing-impaired listeners results from reduced audibility within critical spectral regions of the speech stimuli.","Hearing loss is a global health problem with profound socioeconomic impact. We contend that acquired hearing loss is mainly a modern disorder caused by man-made noise and modern drugs, among other causes. These factors, combined with increasing lifespan, have exposed a deficit in cochlear self-regeneration that was irrelevant for most of mammalian evolution. Nevertheless, the mammalian cochlea has evolved from phylogenetically older structures, which do have the capacity for self-repair. Moreover, nonmammalian vertebrates can regenerate auditory hair cells that restore sensory function. We will offer a critical perspective on recent advances in stem cell biology, gene therapy, cell cycle regulation and pharmacotherapeutics to define and validate regenerative medical interventions for mammalian hair cell loss. Although these advances are promising, we are only beginning to fully appreciate the complexity of the many challenges that lie ahead.","- Label: Unchanged

Text A discusses the effects of hearing loss on speech recognition-comprehension and quantitatively evaluates this impact using the AI model in a scientific setup, while Text B addresses hearing loss from a broader perspective of its causes, evolutionary biology, and potential treatments, including regenerative medical interventions. Despite the difference in depth and breadth of discussion surrounding ""hearing loss,"" the fundamental concept of the target word remains the same in both texts: it consistently identifies the medical condition involving diminished auditory capability. Thus, no significant semantic drift is observed in the usage of ""hearing loss"" over the time span between the texts."

Text A discusses sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) and investigates potential causes and treatment options. Text B explores the establishment of mimetic aging effects that could lead to hearing loss using a biological model (guinea pigs) to understand the molecular pathogenesis associated with hearing loss. Both texts use the term ""hearing loss"" in a medical and biological context related to the inability to hear effectively, which shows that the meaning of ""hearing loss"" has remained consistent between the different time periods covered by the texts. Thus, there is no evidence of significant semantic drift in the term within these contexts."

They are characterized by profound postnatal brain and somatic growth failure and by degeneration of multiple tissues resulting in cachexia, dementia, and premature aging. They result in premature death, usually in childhood, exceptionally in adults. This study compares the clinical course and pathology of a man with Cockayne syndrome group A who died at age 31(1/2) years with 15 adequately documented other adults with Cockayne syndrome and 5 with xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome complex. Slowing of head and somatic growth was apparent before age 2 years, mental retardation and slowly progressive spasticity at 4 years, ataxia and hearing loss at 9 years, visual impairment at 14 years, typical Cockayne facies at 17 years, and cachexia and dementia in his twenties, with a retained outgoing personality. He experienced several transient right and left hemipareses and two episodes of status epilepticus following falls. Neuropathology disclosed profound microencephaly, bilateral old subdural hematomas, white-matter atrophy, tigroid leukodystrophy with string vessels, oligodendrocyte proliferation, bizarre reactive astrocytes, multifocal dystrophic calcification that was most marked in the basal ganglia, advanced atherosclerosis, mixed demyelinating and axonal neuropathy, and neurogenic muscular atrophy. Cellular degeneration of the organ of Corti, spiral and vestibular ganglia, and all chambers of the eye was severe. Rarely, and for unexplained reasons, in some patients with Cockayne syndrome the course is slower than usual, resulting in survival into adulthood. The profound dwarfing, failure of brain growth, cachexia, selectivity of tissue degeneration, and poor correlation between genotypes and phenotypes are not understood. Deficient repair of DNA can increase vulnerability to oxidative stress and play a role in the premature aging, but why patients with mutations in xeroderma pigmentosum genes present with the Cockayne syndrome phenotype is still not known.","- Label: Unchanged

In Text A, the focus is on how hearing loss (referred to as ""acuity dominance"") relates to preference for using one ear over the other in patients experiencing high frequency hearing deficiencies. In Text B, hearing loss is mentioned as one of the symptoms experienced by a patient with Cockayne syndrome, describing a progression of hearing loss among other neurological and physiological degenerations. Although the contexts of the articles and the conditions associated with hearing loss are different, the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a deterioration in hearing remains consistent between both texts. Consequently, the semantic usage of ""hearing loss"" has not changed over the periods these texts cover."
85,Hearing loss,"Experimental herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) labyrinthitis provides a model of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). Corticosteroids improve the prognosis for hearing recovery in ISSHL, but the effects of acyclovir are unknown. To establish the therapeutic efficacy of acyclovir (Zovirax) and prednisolone in experimental HSV-1 viral labyrinthitis, we induced HSV-1 labyrinthitis in 12 guinea pigs. Three animals received no treatment, 3 received prednisolone, 3 received acyclovir, and 3 received both. Four other animals served as controls, receiving culture medium only. Hearing, HSV-1 antibody titers, and cochlear damage were evaluated. The HSV-1 labyrinthitis caused hearing loss within 24 hours. Combination treatment consisting of prednisolone and acyclovir resulted in earlier hearing recovery and less extensive cochlear destruction compared to prednisolone or acyclovir as a monotherapy. The beneficial effect of this treatment modality remains to be demonstrated in ISSHL.","Hearing loss is associated with cognitive/physical health; less is known about mental health.

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""hearing loss"" is specifically addressed within a clinical and biomedical context, focusing on an acute medical condition (idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss - ISSHL) caused by a viral infection and its treatment options. Here ""hearing loss"" is used to describe a specific loss of hearing ability due to identifiable medical reasons which have potential treatment options. On the other hand, Text B explores ""hearing loss"" from a broader epidemiological perspective, addressing its association with mental health and quality of life in older adults. This indicates a shift from a purely medical or physiological condition to a more integrated perspective considering psychological and sociodemographic implications. The term thus incorporates a wider range of consequences of hearing impairment, particularly in how it correlates with broader aspects of health and well-being."

In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" continues to describe the condition where normal auditory perception is compromised or diminished. In Text A, the focus is on identifying and understanding the prevalence and nature of hearing loss in children with Down's syndrome, mentioning the types (primarily conductive and mild degree) and frequency of hearing loss compared to the normal population. In Text B, hearing loss is discussed in the context of potential consequences due to injury of specific arteries (labyrinthine artery and subarcuate artery) during surgical procedures. Despite the different contexts—one being a study on hearing loss in a specific disorder and the other concerning surgical risks—the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss,"" referring to a reduction or impairment in the ability to perceive sound, remains constant between both texts. The usage and implications of the term in relation to auditory health have not changed between the periods observed, indicating that the semantic meaning of ""hearing loss"" is unchanged."

88,Hearing loss,"Between 3 and 25 months of age, light and electron microscopic features of principal neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus of the C57BL/6 mouse were quantitated. This mouse strain has a genetic defect producing progressive sensorineural hearing loss which starts during young adulthood (2 months of age) with high-frequency sounds. During the second year of life, hearing is severely impaired, progressively involving all frequencies. The hearing loss was documented in the present study by auditory brainstem recordings of the mice at various ages. The cochleas from many of the same animals showed massive loss of both inner and outer hair cells beginning at the base (high-frequency region) and progressing with age along the entire length to the apex (low-frequency region). In the inferior colliculi, there was a significant decrease in the size of principal neurons in the central nucleus. There was a dramatic decrease in the number of synapses of all morphologic types on principal neuronal somas. The percentage of somatic membrane covered by synapses decreased by 67%. A ventral (high frequency) to dorsal (low frequency) gradient of synaptic loss could not be identified within the central nucleus. These synaptic changes may be related to the equally dramatic physiologic changes which have been noted in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, in which response properties of neurons normally sensitive to high-frequency sounds become more sensitive to low-frequency sounds. The synaptic loss noted in this study may be due to more than the loss of primary afferent pathways. It may represent alterations of the complex synaptic circuitry related to the central deficits of presbycusis.","It has been reported that about half of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) show high signals in the affected inner ear on three-dimensional, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (3D-FLAIR MRI). These signals may reflect minor hemorrhage or an increased concentration of protein in the inner ear, which has passed through blood vessels with increased permeability. Our objective was to compare the positive ratio of the high signal in affected inner ears at different time points to determine the suitable imaging time point for 3D-FLAIR MRI in SSNHL. 3D-FLAIR MRI images were taken at three times, precontrast and approximately 10 min and 4 h after intravenous injection of a single dose of gadodiamide (Gd) (0.1 mmol/kg), in 46 patients with SNHL. We compared the positive findings of the high signals in the inner ear of patients with SNHL as well as the signal intensity ratio (SIR) between the affected cochleae and unaffected cochleae at three time points. The positive ratios of the high signals in the affected inner ear at the time points of precontrast and 10 min and 4 h after the intravenous Gd injection were 26.1, 32.6, and 41.3%, respectively. The high signal intensity ratios of affected inner ears at the three time points were 1.28, 1.31, and 1.48, respectively. The difference between the positive ratios precontrast and at 10 min after the intravenous Gd injection was statistically significant (P = 0.006); the differences between the positive ratios at 4 h after the intravenous Gd injection and precontrast and between the ratios at 4 h and 10 min after the intravenous Gd injection were not statistically significant. The time effects of the median value of SIR were not significant (P = 0.064). We do not recommend 4 h after intravenous Gd injection as a time point to image the inner ear in SNHL. We believe that imaging precontrast and at 10 min after the intravenous Gd injection are suitable time points.","- Label: Unchanged

89,Hearing loss,"Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable. Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids. A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described. Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane. The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid. Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements. The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz). Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm. At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL. At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL. Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range. Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems. Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.","The ear vulnerability of a group of combat soldiers was tested. The study initially included 84 soldiers and lasted two years. The soldiers were exposed to the noise of small-arms fire. Measurements included transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and pure-tone audiometry. Measurements, initially performed prior to the soldiers' basic training, were repeated several times during the study. In general, TEOAE levels (Em) decreased over time. About 57% of the ears developed a slight hearing loss (SHL) after two years of noise exposure. We define SHL as a threshold shift of 10 dB or greater, in at least at one of the audiometric frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 6000 Hz. About 63% of the tested ears that had medium TEOAE level (1<Em<8 dB SPL) prior to the noise exposure, developed SHL. On the other hand, among the ears whose Em were either very low (Em< or =1 dB SPL) or very high (Em> or =8 dB SPL), less than 30% developed SHL. We suggest a prediction for ear vulnerability on the basis of Em prior to noise exposure.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The usage of the term ""hearing loss"" in both Text A and Text B pertains to the deterioration or deficiency in the ability to hear. In Text A, the focus is on describing surgical methods and technical advancements to combat sensorineural hearing loss via implantable hearing aids. This demonstrates the target word in a context of treating or managing the condition. In Text B, the term is used to describe a study that assesses the progressive hearing degradation in soldiers exposed to combat noise, measuring the extent of auditory damage resulting in hearing loss. Although the contexts differ—one involving technological solutions and the other a pathological study—the underlying concept of ""hearing loss"" as a decline in hearing ability remains constant and central to both documents. Thus, the essence and connotation of the term have not significantly changed between these two periods."
90,Hearing loss,"It is well known that there are wide individual variations in the susceptibility of human hearing to noise exposure. The hearing of male forest workers were examined with vibration-induced white finger (VWF) as an indicator of noise susceptibility of hearing. The results were as follows: 1. Hearing losses at 4 and 8 kHz in subjects with VWF were greater than those of unaffected men in a matched pair case-control study allowing for confounding due to differences of age and noise exposure. 2. The hearing loss at 4 kHz on the ipsilateral side of the hand with VWF was greater than the loss on the contralateral side in subjects with VWF in one hand. 3. The hearing loss at 4 kHz in subjects with VWF progressed more rapidly during a five-year follow-up period than the loss in men with no history of VWF. These results indicate that the hearing of subjects with VWF was more vulnerable to noise than the hearing of subjects without VWF. It was suggested that a pathological change causing VWF, such as enhanced vasoconstriction due to elevated sympathetic nervous tone, could also cause this additional auditory vulnerability to noise exposure.","Hearing loss is the most common sensory defect, and it affects over 6% of the population worldwide. Approximately 50-60% of hearing loss patients are attributed to genetic causes. Currently, more than 100 genes have been reported to cause non-syndromic hearing loss. It is possible and efficient to screen all potential disease-causing genes for hereditary hearing loss by whole exome sequencing (WES).","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A from an earlier period, ""hearing loss"" is primarily discussed in the context of environmental factors such as noise exposure and its association with other physical conditions like vibration-induced white finger (VWF). The focus is on the variability in susceptibility to hearing loss due to external factors and the progression of hearing loss in relation to occupational hazards.

  In Text B from a later period, the focus shifts significantly towards the genetic underpinnings of hearing loss. The discussion revolves around genetic causes being a primary factor for the majority of hearing loss cases, and the use of advanced genetic technologies such as whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify and screen for hereditary hearing loss. This represents a notable shift from environmental to genetic emphasis in understanding and managing hearing loss.

  The semantic drift here is significant as the primary context and discussed causes of ""hearing loss"" have shifted from environmental/occupational factors to a predominantly genetic focus, reflecting changes in medical understanding and technological advances in genomics."

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" refers to the reduction or inability to hear sound in one or both ears. Text A discusses hearing loss associated with genetic factors, particularly a mitochondrial mutation, while Text B addresses hearing loss as a symptom of Goldenhar syndrome, a congenital condition. Despite the different causes and contexts in which ""hearing loss"" occurs in these texts, the essential meaning of the term remains consistent: it denotes a loss of hearing ability. Thus, the semantic usage of ""hearing loss"" has not significantly shifted between the texts."
92,Hearing loss,"The primary goal of this study was to compare the characteristics of the post-implant evoked potentials with preimplant evoked potentials in patients with auditory neuropathy (AN) or dys-synchrony. AN is typically characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, reduced speech perception, abnormal temporal processing, and unusual patterns of results with various objective audiological tests. In some cases, these patients may be appropriate candidates for a cochlear implant. In this article, we highlight evoked potential findings in two children diagnosed with AN who were provided with multichannel cochlear implants. Preoperative, interoperative and postoperative evoked potential measures show that the restoration of neural synchrony may occur at multiple levels of the auditory pathways in patients with AN when appropriate diagnostic tests, cochlear implantation and rehabilitation are provided.","Within the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) pathway, which includes the processes of screening, diagnosis and intervention for paediatric hearing loss, paediatric diagnostic audiology involves a battery of specific tests and procedures. International studies have highlighted a golden standard for diagnosis of paediatric hearing loss as based on the Joint Committee of Infant Hearing (2007) diagnostic guidelines, closely resembling the HPCSA diagnostic guidelines. There are limited South African studies on the processes and protocols followed in diagnostic paediatric audiology.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The usage of the target word ""hearing loss"" in both texts refers to the auditory condition characterized by the decreased ability to perceive sounds as compared to normal hearing levels. In Text A, ""hearing loss"" is discussed in the context of auditory neuropathy and highlights challenges and interventions involved with cochlear implants. Text B explores the diagnostic approaches and standards in the wider framework of early hearing detection and intervention, focusing on pediatric hearing loss specifically. In both contexts, the term maintains its medical connotation related directly to the impairment of hearing, showing no significant drift in meaning between the two time frames. Thus, the use and definition of ""hearing loss"" remain largely consistent, indicating that the semantic meaning has not changed."
93,Hearing loss,To determine whether transtympanic steroid administration may be an effective treatment for sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in patients for whom systemic steroid treatment has failed or who were not candidates for systemic steroids.,The present study investigated the effects of supporting both English and Spanish on language outcomes in bilingual children with hearing loss (HL) who used listening devices (cochlear implants and hearing aids). The English language skills of bilingual children with HL were compared to those of their monolingual English-speaking peers' with HL. The Spanish and English language skills of the bilingual participants were also compared.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" refers to the condition of reduced ability to hear sounds. Text A discusses the treatment aspects of sudden sensorineural hearing loss using steroids, indicating a focus on a specific type or sudden onset of hearing impairment. Text B addresses the impact of hearing loss on bilingual children's language skills using hearing aids or cochlear implants, which reflects a focus on the educational and developmental consequences of hearing loss. Both texts, despite addressing different aspects and contexts, maintain the core meaning of ""hearing loss"" as an impairment in hearing capability. Therefore, the basic semantic meaning of ""hearing loss"" remains unchanged across the two texts, focusing on the loss of hearing ability in both cases."
94,Hearing loss,To determine whether chronic conductive hearing loss in adults results in changes in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) similar to those observed in children with histories of otitis media with effusion.,"Bilaterally progressive tinnitus and hearing impairment occurred in a hypertensive patient shortly after an episode of right ganglionic hemorrhage. Audiometric tests showed a mixed sensorineural and conduction hearing loss. When low-dose gabapentin was administrated for the pre-existing postherpetic thoracic neuralgia, the tinnitus dramatically improved but recurred after discontinuation of the drug. Hearing function did not change. In view of a controversy of gabapentin and tinnitus in previous trials, the findings in this patient support that low-dose gabapentin benefits the subgroup of tinnitus patients with secondary contributing factors, such as stroke.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" is used to describe auditory impairments, though the context and associated conditions vary slightly. Text A discusses hearing loss from chronic causes like otitis media, inquiring about changes to auditory responses, while Text B describes hearing loss combined with tinnitus following a cerebrovascular accident (stroke). In both cases, ""hearing loss"" refers to the reduction in hearing capabilities, maintaining a consistent definition across both texts. Despite the different medical circumstances and comorbid conditions mentioned, the fundamental meaning of ""hearing loss"" as a decrease in auditory function remains unchanged between the two texts."
95,Hearing loss,"Loudness recruitment and reduced frequency resolution both occur in cochlear types of hearing loss. One theory of loudness recruitment suggests that, as intensity is coded partly by spread of excitation across the nerve fibre array, recruitment is a direct consequence of the broad spread of excitation associated with poor frequency resolution. The present study investigated the relationship between these two quantities. The study involved a simple measure of frequency resolution (three-point psychoacoustical tuning curve, PTC) and conventional measures of recruitment obtained from patients undergoing neuro-otological investigation. Results from 376 ears of 226 patients without any material conductive impairment are presented. Measures of recruitment included the alternate binaural loudness balance test (ABLB) and estimates of dynamic range given by the sensation levels of the uncomfortable loudness level and the acoustic reflex threshold. Once covariation with hearing threshold level had been accounted for, no clear relationship emerged between frequency resolution and any of the measures of recruitment. This finding does not support the notion that frequency resolution and recruitment are specifically related. Rather, PTCs provide information complementary to measures of recruitment.",To observe the alterations of auditory brainstem response (ABR) in guinea pigs with gentamicin-induced hearing loss under awake and anesthetic conditions.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" refers to the impairment or reduction in the ability to hear sounds. Text A discusses specific mechanisms and assessments related to hearing loss in humans in a clinical and neuro-otological context, focusing on aspects like loudness recruitment and frequency resolution. Text B, although shorter and less detailed, still discusses hearing loss in the context of auditory impairments (specifically examining auditory brainstem responses in guinea pigs subjected to gentamicin, which is known to cause hearing loss). There is no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of ""hearing loss"" between the two texts; it continues to refer to conditions where hearing capability is impaired or diminished."
96,Hearing loss,Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and has been associated with delayed language development and behavioural problems. Some have argued that children should be screened and treated early if found to have clinically important OME. The aim of this review was to assess evidence from randomized controlled trials about the effectiveness of screening and treating children with clinically important OME in the first 4 years of their life. The primary outcome was language development.,"The Mouse Genomes Project is an ongoing collaborative effort to sequence the genomes of the common laboratory mouse strains. In 2011, the initial analysis of sequence variation across 17 strains found 56.7 M unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 8.8 M indels. We carry out deep sequencing of 13 additional inbred strains (BUB/BnJ, C57BL/10J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, DBA/1J, I/LnJ, KK/HiJ, MOLF/EiJ, NZB/B1NJ, NZW/LacJ, RF/J, SEA/GnJ and ST/bJ), cataloguing molecular variation within and across the strains. These strains include important models for immune response, leukaemia, age-related hearing loss and rheumatoid arthritis. We now have several examples of fully sequenced closely related strains that are divergent for several disease phenotypes.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" is used in the context of medical and health-related discussions concerning the impairment or decrease in the ability to hear. Text A discusses hearing loss in children associated with otitis media with effusion, while Text B mentions age-related hearing loss as a condition being studied in mouse models. Although the contexts are somewhat different—one focusing on children and the other on aged mice—the fundamental meaning of the term ""hearing loss"" as a reduction in hearing capability remains the same across the two texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning of the word ""hearing loss"" between the two time periods covered by the texts."
97,Hearing loss,"The diagnosis of vestibulocochlear nerve and statoacoustic organ lesions is based on the symptoms vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. The most common diseases are vestibular neuronitis, Ménière's disease, benign positional vertigo and sudden hearing loss. 6 patients are presented, complaining of at least one of the symptoms vertigo, hearing loss or tinnitus. They were suspected of suffering from a peripheral audiovestibular disease when admitted to the clinic, but all of them revealed other pathologies. A careful history and step-wise otoneurologic diagnostics including clinical examination, otoneurologic testing, audiologic tests, electronystagmography, acoustic evoked potentials and imaging techniques finally resulted in the correct diagnosis.","Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is an oncological emergency. It is expected that the incidence of SVCS may rise with the increase in usage of central lines for both oncological and non-oncological reasons. The authors of this article present a case study in which a 56-year-old female patient presented at the emergency department with a three-week history of facial swelling, significant hearing loss, unrelenting cough, hoarseness, and swelling of the arms, chest and upper back. A CT scan demonstrated total occlusion of the superior vena cava, confirming SVCS. In this case report, the authors present a discussion of the causes of SVCS, its clinical presentation in relation to this patient's history, and the intervention provided to this patient.","### Answer:
- Target word: Hearing loss
- Text A: Hearing loss is mentioned directly as a symptom that occurs alongside vertigo and tinnitus in the context of peripheral audiovestibular diseases. The usage focuses on hearing loss as a physical symptom or clinical sign that helps in diagnosing specific vestibular and auditory conditions.
- Text B: Hearing loss is presented as one symptom suffered by a patient alongside others, including facial swelling and hoarseness, in the context of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS). Here, hearing loss is used to help describe the patient's overall clinical status and contributes to identifying the presence of a specific syndrome, suggesting a differential diagnosis based not just on ear-related diseases.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""hearing loss"" continues to refer to the loss of audiological function as a symptom related to an underlying condition. While the two texts associate it with different medical conditions (vestibulocochlear nerve diseases vs. superior vena cava syndrome), the inherent meaning of the term as a departure from normal auditory function remains the same. There is no indication of a semantic shift in how the term ""hearing loss"" is understood medically between the two texts, despite different contexts."
98,Hearing loss,"In 33 Menière patients (42 ears) the therapeutic effects of Dyazide (50 mg triamterene and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) were investigated in a cross-over placebo-controlled study. The hearing was measured by tone and speech audiometry whereas tinnitus and vertigo were recorded using fixed scales. In this study, Dyazide was found to have no significant effect on hearing or tinnitus. However, the vestibular complaints decreased significantly during the Dyazide treatment. Ears with a positive glycerol or furosemide test and ears with a fluctuating hearing loss did not show significant differences in hearing thresholds between the two periods in the trial. Of the 33 patients 17 had a distinct preference for Dyazide whereas 3 patients chose the placebo. The remaining 13 patients had no preference.","To search for predictive factors for language development measured by two receptive language tests for children, the Galker test (a word-recognition-in-noise test) testing hearing and vocabulary, and the Danish version of Reynell Developmental Language Scale (2nd revision, RDLS II) test, a language comprehension test. The study analysed if information about background variables and parents and pre-school teachers was predictive for test scores; if earlier middle ear disease, actual hearing loss and tympanometry was important for language development; and if the two receptive tests differed in terms of the degree to which variables were able to predict test scores at the age of three to five years.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""hearing loss"" is used in the same medical context referring to a decrease or loss in the ability to hear. Text A discusses the evaluation of hearing loss as part of a study to measure the effectiveness of a treatment in Menière patients. Similarly, Text B evaluates hearing loss as it relates to language development in children. In both cases, ""hearing loss"" directly refers to the reduction or impairment in auditory ability, with no significant shift in the general meaning or usage of the term between the two time periods."
99,Hearing loss,"Missense mutations in the coagulation factor C homology (COCH) gene (14q12-q13) cause the autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular disorder DFNA9 (OMIM 603196), and a high prevalence of symptoms of Meniere disease (MD) has been described in families with a mutation in the COCH gene. In this study, we search for mutations in the COCH gene in peripheral blood from patients with definite MD. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of 30 individuals with MD and 30 controls. Exons 4 and 5 of the COCH gene were amplified by PCR reaction, using primer pairs flanking both exons. Sequences were analysed by a DNA sequencing system and compared with the published COCH cDNA sequence. No differences were found in the nucleotide sequences of exons 4 and 5 in the COCH gene in patients with definite sporadic MD when they were compared with the control group. Patients with definite MD have a low prevalence of mutations in exons 4 and 5 of the COCH gene.","Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted interests as non-invasive biomarkers of physiological and pathological conditions, which may be applied in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). However, no epidemiology studies have yet examined the potential effects of NIHL or noise exposure on miRNA expression profiles.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""hearing loss"" is used in relation to its primary meaning, which is the partial or total inability to hear. Text A discusses genetic factors associated with sensorineural hearing loss while Text B explores the search for biomarkers that can link to noise-induced hearing loss. Both contexts pertain to biological and medical aspects of hearing impairment, and the term retains its core meaning related to the loss of hearing ability in both texts. Thus, the semantic drift of the target word ""hearing loss"" between the two texts is labeled as ""Unchanged""."
0,Dyslexia,"If reading disabilities were the result of developmental lags, disabled readers should catch up to their peers in proficiency at maturity. As a test of this hypothesis, current literacy skills were assessed for adults who did, and did not, have childhood reading disabilities. Contrary to the developmental lag hypothesis, most of the former group remained poor readers in adulthood, in many cases reading more than two standard deviations below levels predicted by IQ. Both within and between groups, very similar relationships were observed between reading level and: word recognition; phonic analysis; prose comprehension; reading speed; spelling ability and error types; and tolerance for visual and semantic text transformations. Other purported characteristics of dyslexia differentiated disabled from normal adult readers with only limited success. The results have implications for theoretical, methodological, and practical issues in the study of dyslexia in childhood as well as adulthood.","Poor reading skills of developmental dyslexics persist into adulthood with standard remediation protocols having little effect. Nevertheless, reading improves if readers are induced to read faster. Here we show that this improvement can be enhanced by training. Training follows a multi-session procedure adapted to silent sentence reading, with individually set, increasingly more demanding, time constraints (letter-by-letter masking). In both typical and dyslexic adult readers, reading times are shortened and comprehension improves. After training, the dyslexic readers' performance is similar to that of typical readers; moreover, their connected text reading times and comprehension scores significantly improve in standard reading tests and are retained at 6 months post training. Identical training without time constraints proves ineffective. Our results suggest that fluent reading depends in part on rapid information processing, which then might affect perception, cognitive processing and possibly eye movements. These processes remain malleable in adulthood, even in individuals with developmental dyslexia.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A and Text B usage:
  - In Text A, ""dyslexia"" refers to the continuation of reading disabilities into adulthood despite earlier expectations of improvement, emphasizing the persistence of the condition beyond childhood and refuting the notion that dyslexia is just a developmental lag.
  - In Text B, ""dyslexia"" is described specifically as a condition where reading skills can improve with specific, speed-focused training methods in adulthood, shifting the focus towards potential intervention methods that can significantly alter reading abilities in dyslexic adults.

- Label: Changed

- Reason:
  While the fundamental definition concerning reading difficulties remains consistent (thus developmental dyslexia involves persistent challenges in reading), the perspective on treatment and outcomes has shifted. Text A largely discusses the stable, persistent nature of dyslexia into adulthood, while Text B highlights a transformative approach where specific training can lead to considerable improvement, almost equating dyslexic readers' abilities with typical readers. This shift from viewing dyslexia as a fixed trait to viewing it as a malleable condition susceptible to significant improvement through targeted interventions signifies a notable change in how outcomes associated with dyslexia are perceived."
1,Dyslexia,"Research by Evans et al. (Ophthal. Physiol. Opt. 15, 481-487, 1995) has demonstrated a correlation between visual processing and ocular motor factors in people with specific reading difficulties (dyslexia). In addition, research by Wilkins et al. (Ophthal. Physiol. Opt. 14, 365-370, 1994) has shown that some people with dyslexia will benefit from a reduction of perceptual symptoms of discomfort and distortion if they use individually prescribed coloured filters. Three examples of the dyslexic patients who attend at the Institute of Optometry clearly demonstrate the importance of full investigation of ocular function, including the assessment of the effect of colour on visual perception. All three patients presented with similar symptoms of asthenopia when reading. Symptoms were alleviated for the first patient by use of orthoptic treatment of an exotropia with intermittent suppression. With the second patient, ocular motor functions were found to be within acceptable limits and relief of symptoms was obtained by the prescribing of lenses of a specific chromaticity. For the third patient, both orthoptic intervention and the use of specifically tinted lenses were necessary to relieve the visual difficulties that were being experienced. By taking advantage of recent research and developments in optometric instrumentation, it is possible for some of those with dyslexia to receive considerable benefit from optometric intervention.","Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder often characterized by reduced awareness of speech units. Whether the neural source of this phonological disorder in dyslexic readers results from the malfunctioning of the primary auditory system or damaged feedback communication between higher-order phonological regions (i.e., left inferior frontal regions) and the auditory cortex is still under dispute. Here we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from 20 dyslexic readers and 20 age-matched controls while they were listening to ∼10-s-long spoken sentences. Compared to controls, dyslexic readers had (1) an impaired neural entrainment to speech in the delta band (0.5-1 Hz); (2) a reduced delta synchronization in both the right auditory cortex and the left inferior frontal gyrus; and (3) an impaired feedforward functional coupling between neural oscillations in the right auditory cortex and the left inferior frontal regions. This shows that during speech listening, individuals with developmental dyslexia present reduced neural synchrony to low-frequency speech oscillations in primary auditory regions that hinders higher-order speech processing steps. The present findings, thus, strengthen proposals assuming that improper low-frequency acoustic entrainment affects speech sampling. This low speech-brain synchronization has the strong potential to cause severe consequences for both phonological and reading skills. Interestingly, the reduced speech-brain synchronization in dyslexic readers compared to normal readers (and its higher-order consequences across the speech processing network) appears preserved through the development from childhood to adulthood. Thus, the evaluation of speech-brain synchronization could possibly serve as a diagnostic tool for early detection of children at risk of dyslexia.

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" consistently refers to a condition characterized by difficulties in reading, processing spoken or written language, or related perceptual issues. Text A from 1995 focuses on the relationship between dyslexia and visual processing, discussing how ocular motor functions and the use of colored filters can mitigate some dyslexic symptoms through optometric interventions. Text B from 2016 elaborates on the neurophysiological aspects of dyslexia, particularly as they relate to auditory processing and phonological capabilities in dyslexic individuals. Both texts maintain a focus on dyslexia as a disorder influencing individuals' interaction with language, either written or auditory, although they approach from different scientific perspectives (optometric vs. neurophysiological). This shows that the understanding of dyslexia as a reading or language processing difficulty remains fundamentally unchanged despite differing research focus or findings regarding its specific influences and manifestations. Thus, the semantic drift of the term ""dyslexia"" is labeled as ""Unchanged"" based on the contextual usage that persistently aligns with the core description of the disorder over the period considered."
2,Dyslexia,"The causes of dyslexia are unknown, but previous studies have suggested an immunological basis in some cases.

Therefore, the semantic content relating to dyslexia has not significantly drifted but is rather expanded upon in different contexts."
3,Dyslexia,"This study examines morphological awareness in developmental dyslexia. While the poor phonological awareness of dyslexic children has been related to their difficulty in handling the alphabetical principle, less is known about their morphological awareness, which also plays an important part in reading development. The aim of this study was to analyze in more detail the implications of the phonological impairments of dyslexics in dealing with larger units of language such as morphemes. First, the performance of dyslexic children in a series of morphological tasks was compared with the performance of children matched on reading-level and chronological age. In all the tasks, the dyslexic group performed below the chronological age control group, suggesting that morphological awareness cannot be developed entirely independently of reading experience and/or phonological skills. Comparisons with the reading-age control group indicated that, while the dyslexic children were poorer in the morphemic segmentation tasks, they performed normally for their reading level in the sentence completion tasks. Furthermore, they produced more derived words in the production task. This suggests that phonological impairments prevent the explicit segmentation of affixes while allowing the development of productive morphological knowledge. A second study compared dyslexic subgroups defined by their degree of phonological impairment. Our results suggest that dyslexics develop a certain type of morphological knowledge which they use as a compensatory reading strategy.","Children with dyslexia and/or specific language impairment have marked deficits in phonological processing, putting them at an increased risk for reading deficits. The current study sought to examine the influence of word-level phonological and lexical characteristics on phonological awareness. Children with dyslexia and/or specific language impairment were tested using a phoneme deletion task in which stimuli differed orthogonally by sound similarity and neighborhood density. Phonological and lexical factors influenced performance differently across groups. Children with dyslexia appeared to have a more immature and aberrant pattern of phonological and lexical influence (e.g., favoring sparse and similar features). Children with SLI performed less well than children who were typically developing, but followed a similar pattern of performance (e.g., favoring dense and dissimilar features). Collectively, our results point to both quantitative and qualitative differences in lexical organization and phonological representations in children with SLI and in children with dyslexia. ","### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The focus in this text is on dyslexia as it relates to reading and language processing impairments, particularly emphasizing the challenges in morphological awareness. It discusses the difficulties dyslexic individuals face with phonological impairments and how these impairments affect their ability to segment and understand morphemes. The text portrays dyslexia primarily as a reading disorder characterized by specific deficits in handling language units crucial for reading fluency and comprehension.
- Text B: This text also deals with dyslexia primarily in the context of phonological processing deficits, highlighting the impact on reading abilities. The text examines phonological awareness and how different lexical characteristics influence the performance of children with dyslexia. Similar to Text A, it considers dyslexia as a disorder that affects reading through impaired phonological and lexical processing.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the meaning and context of use of the word ""dyslexia"" remain consistent. The term is still used to denote a specific learning disability that affects reading and language processing skills due to phonological deficits. Both texts emphasize the neurodevelopmental aspects of dyslexia that impact language processing capabilities, thereby showing that the semantic content of the term ""dyslexia"" has not drifted significantly over time. The discussions in both texts revolve around academic and clinical perspectives, reinforcing the term's stability in meaning."
4,Dyslexia,"Eight dyslexic subjects, impaired on a range of tasks requiring phonological processing, were matched for age and general ability with six control subjects. Participants were scanned using positron emission tomography (PET) during three conditions: repeating real words, repeating pseudowords, and rest. In both groups, speech repetition relative to rest elicited widespread bilateral activation in areas associated with auditory processing of speech; there were no significant differences between words and pseudowords. However, irrespective of word type, the dyslexic group showed less activation than the control group in the right superior temporal and right post-central gyri and also in the left cerebellum. Notably, the right anterior superior temporal cortex (Brodmann's area 22 [BA 22]) was less activated in each of the eight dyslexic subjects, compared to each of the six control subjects. This deficit appears to be specific to auditory repetition as it was not detected in a previous study of reading which used the same sets of stimuli (Brunswick, N., McCrory, E., Price, C., Frith, C.D., & Frith, U. [1999]. Explicit and implicit processing of words and pseudowords by adult developmental dyslexics: A search for Wernicke's Wortschatz? Brain, 122, 1901-1917). This implies that the observed neural manifestation of developmental dyslexia is task-specific (i.e., functional rather than structural). Other studies of normal subjects indicate that attending to the phonetic structure of speech leads to a decrease in right-hemisphere processing. Lower right hemisphere activation in the dyslexic group may therefore indicate less processing of non-phonetic aspects of speech, allowing greater salience to be accorded to phonological aspects of attended speech.","Accumulating evidence from both human lesion and functional neuroimaging studies appears to support the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to non-motor functions. Along similar lines, cognitive, affective and behavioural changes in psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia, have been linked to structural cerebellar abnormalities. The aim of this special issue was to evaluate the current knowledge base after more than 20 years of controversial discussion. The contributions of the special issue cover the most important cognitive domains, i.e., attention, memory and learning, executive control, language and visuospatial function. The available empirical evidence suggests that cognitive changes in patients with cerebellar dysfunction are mild and clearly less severe than the impairments observed after lesions to neocortical areas to which the cerebellum is closely connected via different cerebro-cerebellar loops. Frequently cited early findings, e.g., with respect to a specific cerebellar involvement in attention, have not been replicated or might be confounded by motor or working memory demands of the respective attention task. On the other hand, there is now convincing evidence for a cerebellar involvement in the mediation of a range of cognitive domains, most notably verbal working memory. Verbal working memory problems may partly underlie the compromised performance of cerebellar lesion patients on at least some complex cognitive tasks. Although investigations have moved from anecdotical case reports to hypothesis-driven controlled clinical group studies based on sound methods which are complemented by state-of-the-art functional neuroimaging studies, the empirical evidence available so far does not yet allow a convincing theory of the mechanisms of a cerebellar involvement in cognitive function. Future studies are clearly needed to further elucidate the nature of the processes linked to cerebellar mediation of cognitive processes and their possible link to motor theories of cerebellar function, e.g., its role in prediction and/or timing.","- Target word: Dyslexia

It pinpoints lesser activity in certain specific brain regions of dyslexic subjects, associating these patterns with dyslexia as a developmental disorder affecting phonological processing.
  
- Text B: In this text, the discussion still pertains to dyslexia, but rather within a broader consideration of psychiatric disorders and cerebellar involvement in cognitive functions. It references dyslexia in the context of broader cognitive, affective, and behavioral changes possibly linked to the cerebellum and highlights the ongoing research into cognitive aspects influenced by cerebellar activity, including verbal working memory, which can pertain to dyslexia.

Though Text B broadens the context to include cerebellar involvement and its implications for cognitive functions within neuropsychiatric disorders, including dyslexia, the core understanding of dyslexia as a disorder impacting cognitive processing, particularly of verbal and linguistic elements, remains consistent between both periods. Hence, the semantic meaning of ""dyslexia"" appears unchanged, still aligning with its recognition as a cognitive or learning disorder."
5,Dyslexia,"The authors report findings in a 67-year-old right-handed man who had an ischemic infarct in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery. The clinical manifestation consisted mainly of total alexia without agraphia. The patient gradually recovered, subsequently showing the syndrome of spelling dyslexia. Cerebral MR-images revealed a circumscript infarction of medial and basal parts of left temporal lobe. In the acute stage [99mTc]HM-PAO SPECT was characterized by a diminished uptake in the definitely infarcted area and hyperfixation in the region of the left forceps major. Because high retention of HM-PAO indicates potentially salvageable tissue after an ischemic event, the depicted area might be correlated with the recovery of function. Thus, the authors' neuroimaging data give further support to the assumption that the left forceps major is a critical area for global alexia, whereas spelling dyslexia is due to involvement of the left medio-basal temporal lobe.","We enrolled pediatric subjects with developmental dyslexia and, as a control group, healthy age- and sex-matched subjects without developmental dyslexia.

Both Text A and Text B use the target word ""Dyslexia"" within a medical and clinical context, maintaining a similar meaning across the two different time periods. In Text A from an earlier timeframe, ""Dyslexia"" is discussed in the context of cerebrovascular events affecting language functions such as spelling, categorized here as ""spelling dyslexia."" The word pertains to a specific form of dyslexia emerging due to neurological damage, specifically after a stroke that impacts the left temporal lobe. 

In Text B, ""Dyslexia"" is mentioned as ""developmental dyslexia,"" which refers to a condition from developmental stages affecting reading, writing, and spelling abilities, examined through medical procedures including thyroid function and ultrasonography. Despite focusing more on the developmental aspect, the term still denotes a disorder affecting specific brain functions related to language and literacy.

In both contexts, though the specifics and nuances of medical assessment differ (stroke-related in Text A and developmental with additional thyroid evaluation in Text B), the core meaning of ""Dyslexia"" as a neurological condition impacting reading and related skills remains stable. Therefore, the term ""Dyslexia"" shows no significant semantic drift and maintains its relevance to reading and spelling disorders in both academic and medical discourse across the years described."
6,Dyslexia,"A recently introduced optometric technique, colorimetry, enables the perceptual effects of ophthalmic tints to be evaluated subjectively, optimized, and then prescribed in tinted spectacles. The new technique is beneficial in reducing visual stress in patients with dyslexia and migraine. We describe an open trial designed to ascertain: (1) whether the colorimetry assessment, as it is now given, is safe for the investigation of photosensitive patients in optometry clinics where colorimetry equipment is most readily available, but where EEG control is not practical; (2) what proportion of patients with photosensitive epilepsy is likely to benefit to the extent already described in individual cases; (3) whether a tint selected by colorimetry could be shown to reduce the incidence of paroxysmal epileptiform EEG activity in response to flicker and patterns, thereby validating the subjective methods and corroborating the reported seizure reduction. Twenty-four females and nine males (aged 12-43 years) took part. All the patients had suffered visually-provoked seizures, had exhibited a photoparoxysmal response on at least one previous EEG recording, and had received a diagnosis of photosensitive epilepsy. Twenty-two were currently experiencing seizures. A further EEG was recorded in all except seven cases: a routine resting record, followed by hyperventilation. Colorimetry was performed after hyperventilation and before photic stimulation. Twenty-three (70%) reported beneficial effects during colorimetry and were prescribed glasses. There was a preponderance of lenses with a rose or purple colour, in contrast to patients with dyslexia. Seventeen of the 23 patients were available at follow-up, an average of 2.4 years later. Thirteen (57%) reported benefits, and said they were still using the lenses. In six of the 13 the benefits were pronounced, including a reduction of dizziness from fluorescent lighting, elimination of aura when using computer screens etc. Only in three cases was there a reduction in seizures that could reasonably be attributed to the use of lenses; in two of these cases no medications were prescribed, and in the third the medications remained unchanged for four years, two before and two after the introduction of the glasses. In an additional four cases a reduction in seizures was observed but medication had been changed. There was a modest reduction in EEG photosensitivity with the coloured lenses but also to an equivalent or lesser extent with grey in all of the eight patients examined in this way. One patient had seizures during colorimetry, but the seizures were not accompanied by scalp EEG changes.","The current study examined the effect of morphological knowledge on spelling development in Hebrew-speaking schoolchildren, adolescents and adults with dyslexia, compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Participants were 238 Hebrew-speaking readers of five grade levels of whom 139 were TD and 99 had developmental dyslexia (DD). Participants were tested on a function letter spelling task, a phonological awareness task and a morphological awareness task. The overall picture that emerged from the results is that performance on all measures increased with grade level, with TD participants always scoring higher than peers with DD. Moreover, the higher the morphological complexity in spelling and irregularity in noun inflection, the higher the differences between the DD and TD participants. Finally, performance on the morphological awareness task contributed to spelling morphologically more complex spelling items in the TD, but not in the DD group. From clinical and educational perspectives, these results strongly suggest that rigorous morphological instruction is necessary in teaching children and adolescents with dyslexia to identify and use morphological cues in spoken and written Hebrew.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" refers to a condition affecting reading and related language-based processing skills. Text A specifically discusses the applicative use of colorimetry to help alleviate visual stress in patients with dyslexia, illustrating the supportive treatments aimed at mitigating specific symptoms of dyslexia like visual disturbances. Text B focuses on the academic research aspect, examining how morphological knowledge influences spelling for individuals with dyslexia, emphasizing educational approaches to help those with the condition. Although the focus and application of dyslexia-related strategies differ, the fundamental understanding of ""dyslexia"" as a learning disability associated with reading and language challenges remains consistent between both texts. Thus, the meaning of the word 'dyslexia' has not undergone significant semantic drift."
7,Dyslexia,"In tests of her ability to produce written and spoken language, this deep dyslexic patient produced semantic, visual, and derivational errors, including functor substitutions, and exhibited part-of-speech and abstractness effects in oral reading, oral and written naming, and writing to dictation, but not in repetition of single words and copying from memory. This patient therefore provides confirmation of the hypothesis presented in Nolan and Caramazza (1982) that the defining symptoms of deep dyslexia will be observed in responses to any task which requires lexical mediation. The patient's written responses in all tasks but direct copying were characterized by spelling errors which included transpositions, omissions, substitutions, and additions of letters. A model of writing is proposed which explains these errors in terms of a disruption of a phoneme-grapheme conversion process which normally functions to prevent decay of information from a Graphemic Buffer.","As some critics have stated, the term ""developmental dyslexia"" refers to a strictly human disorder, relating to a strictly human capacity - reading - so it cannot be modeled in experimental animals, much less so in lowly rodents.

- Reason: In Text A, dyslexia is characterized primarily by issues related to the production and comprehension of written language, focusing on its cognitive and neurological implications. Text B, while discussing the inability to model dyslexia accurately in non-human subjects, continues to describe it as a human-specific disorder impacting reading and related neurological functions in a similar vein. Both texts focus on the neurological and cognitive abnormalities associated with dyslexia, suggesting that while the discussion context (clinical vs. animal modeling) has shifted, the fundamental understanding and description of dyslexia encompassing difficulties with reading due to brain processing issues remain consistent across both texts. Thus, the semantic usage of ""dyslexia"" remains largely unchanged."
8,Dyslexia,"We review data from our laboratory related to a view of dyslexia as a biological disorder, or deficit, caused by both structural and functional brain abnormalities. The review is focused on central auditory processing in dyslexia, and the possibility that impairments in the auditory or acoustic features of the phonological code may be at the heart of the impairments seen in dyslexia. Three methodological approaches by which to investigate central auditory processing deficits are outlined: dichotic listening (DL) to consonant-vowel syllables; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the use of event-related potentials (ERPs). Consonant-vowel syllable DL is a technique for probing the functional status of phonological processing areas in the superior temporal gyrus, particularly in the left hemisphere. MRI is a corresponding structural, or morphological, measure of anatomical abnormalities in the same brain region, particularly covering the planum temporale area. The ERP technique, and particularly the mismatch negativity (MMN) component, reveals cortical dysfunctions in sensory processing and memory related to basic acoustic events. For all three approaches, the dyslexic children were seen to differ from their control counterparts, including absence of modulation of the right ear advantage (REA), in DL through shifting of attention, smaller left-sided planum temporale asymmetry, and prolonged latency in the MMN ERP complex, particularly in the time-deviant stimulus condition.","Developmental dyslexia is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders affecting children, but prevalence data on this condition are poor.

Furthermore we critical new trends in pedagogical and school-ministerial institutions neglecting clinical facts concerning the complexities of causes, primary and secondary symptoms of reading and writing disorders. Finally various scientific efforts are reviewed which aim at gaining more precise knowledge on the correlations between physiological brain processes and the normal or disturbed learning of reading and writing.","In the present study, we used a three-time point longitudinal design to investigate the associations of morphological awareness to word reading and spelling in a small group of those with and without dyslexia taken from a larger sample of 164 Hong Kong Chinese children who remained in a longitudinal study across ages 6, 7 and 8. Among those 164 children, 15 had been diagnosed as having dyslexia by professional psychologists, and 15 other children manifested average reading ability and had been randomly selected from the sample for comparison. All children were administered a battery of tasks including Chinese character recognition, word dictation, morphological awareness, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming. Multivariate analysis of variance and predictive discriminate analysis were performed to examine whether the dyslexic children showed differences in the cognitive-linguistic tasks in comparison with controls. Results suggested that the dyslexic groups had poorer performance in morphological awareness and RAN across all 3 years. However, phonological awareness was not stable in distinguishing the groups. Findings suggest that morphological awareness is a relatively strong correlate of spelling difficulties in Chinese, but phonological awareness is not.

Text A addresses dyslexia in terms of diagnosis methods and critiques pedagogical approaches, referencing the complexity of the condition and its variety of symptoms. Text B details a specific study about dyslexia involving children, focusing on cognitive-linguistic tasks to compare dyslexic and non-dyslexic individuals. Both texts frame dyslexia as a learning disorder primarily related to difficulties in reading and writing, using scientific and diagnostic methodologies to analyze and assess dyslexia.

10,Dyslexia,"Perceptual discrimination between speech sounds belonging to different phoneme categories is better than that between sounds falling within the same category. This property, known as ""categorical perception,"" is weaker in children affected by dyslexia. Categorical perception develops from the predispositions of newborns for discriminating all potential phoneme categories in the world's languages. Predispositions that are not relevant for phoneme perception in the ambient language are usually deactivated during early childhood. However, the current study shows that dyslexic children maintain a higher sensitivity to phonemic distinctions irrelevant in their linguistic environment. This suggests that dyslexic children use an allophonic mode of speech perception that, although without straightforward consequences for oral communication, has obvious implications for the acquisition of alphabetic writing. Allophonic perception specifically affects the mapping between graphemes and phonemes, contrary to other manifestations of dyslexia, and may be a core deficit.","We examined the slowing in vocal reaction times shown by dyslexic (compared to control) children with that of older (compared to younger) adults using an approach focusing on the detection of global, non-task-specific components. To address this aim, data were analyzed with reference to the difference engine (DEM) and rate and amount (RAM) models. In Experiment 1, typically developing children, children with dyslexia (both attending sixth grade), younger adults and older adults read words and non-words and named pictures. In Experiment 2, word and picture conditions were presented to dyslexic and control children attending eighth grade. In both experiments, dyslexic children were delayed in reading conditions, while they were unimpaired in naming pictures (a finding which indicates spared access to the phonological lexicon). The reading difficulty was well accounted for by a single multiplicative factor while only the residual effect of length (but not frequency and lexicality) was present after controlling for over-additivity using a linear mixed effects model with random slopes on critical variables. Older adults were slower than younger adults across reading and naming conditions. This deficit was well described by a single multiplicative factor. Thus, while slowing of information processing is limited to orthographic stimuli in dyslexic children, it cuts across verbal tasks in older adults. Overall, speed differences in groups such as dyslexic children and older adults can be effectively described with reference to deficits in domains encompassing a variety of experimental conditions rather than deficits in single specific task/conditions. The DEM and RAM prove effective in teasing out global vs. specific components of performance.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: In this text, ""dyslexia"" is specifically considered in the context of speech perception impairments. It describes dyslexia's effect on children's ability to differentiate phoneme categories which impacts their learning of alphabetic writing, suggesting a neurological basis tied to speech perception.
- Text B: Here, ""dyslexia"" is discussed in a broader context of cognitive processing, particularly in how it affects general reading and reaction times in children in comparison to various controls. The emphasis is on dyslexia leading to delays in processing orthographic stimuli and not affecting tasks (such as naming pictures) that do not require such processing, indicating a specific impairment in terms of accessing written information rather than a generalized cognitive delay.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Although the contexts and details concerning dyslexia explored in the two texts vary, involving different aspects of how dyslexia can manifest—be it impacts on speech perception or reading efficiency—the underlying conceptualization of dyslexia as a disability primarily affecting language-related tasks remains consistent. Both texts explore this impairment in respective experimental frameworks but focus on the reading and processing difficulties central to dyslexia's definition. Thus, the essential meaning of the word ""dyslexia"" as a specific learning disability characterized by difficulties in reading, writing, and interacting with orthographic and phonemic data remains unchanged over the years covered by the texts."
11,Dyslexia,"Individuals with developmental language disabilities, including developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI), exhibit impairments in processing rapidly presented auditory stimuli. It has been hypothesized that these deficits are associated with concurrent deficits in speech perception and, in turn, impaired language development. Additionally, postmortem analyses of human dyslexic brains have revealed the presence of focal neocortical malformations such as cerebrocortical microgyria. In an initial study bridging these research domains, we found that male rats with induced microgyria were impaired in discriminating rapidly presented auditory stimuli. In order to further assess this anatomical- behavioral association, we designed two experiments using auditory-reflex modification. These studies were intended to assess whether auditory processing deficits in microgyric male rats would be seen in threshold detection of a silent gap in white noise, and in oddball detection of a two-tone stimulus of variable duration. Results showed no differences between sham and microgyric subjects on gap detection, but did show that microgyric subjects were impaired in the discrimination of two-tone stimuli presented in an oddball paradigm. This impairment was evident for stimuli with total duration of 64 msec or less, while both groups were able to discriminate stimuli with duration of 89 msec or greater. The current results further support the relationship between malformations of the cerebral cortex and deficits in rapid auditory processing. They also suggest that the parameters characterizing rapid auditory processing deficits for a specific task may be influenced by stimulus features and/or cognitive demand of that particular task.","Candidates with disabilities are eligible for reasonable adjustments (RA) while undertaking the national Prescribing Safety Assessment (PSA).

Meanwhile, Text B addresses practical accommodations for individuals with dyslexia in a testing scenario, acknowledging the challenges they face due to their dyslexia. Despite the different applications and contexts, the fundamental meaning and association of the word ""dyslexia"" as a learning disability affecting language and reading skills remains consistent between the texts.

12,Dyslexia,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the use of teacher assessments in screening for learning disabilities. In a longitudinal study, 603 children were rated by their teachers in the second grade (age 8 to 9 years), and the ratings were correlated with examinations of reading, spelling, and intelligence in the third grade. The third-grade tests for reading, spelling, and intelligence classified children into groups with low achievement and dyslexia, and these two groups were compared with normally achieving children. The accuracy of teacher assessments, measured with correlation analysis, ROC curves, and kappa indices, showed that teachers were quite accurate in their judgment of low achievement, but somewhat less efficient in their judgment of specific reading difficulties.","This study had three goals: to examine the stability of deficits in the phonological and lexical routes in dyslexia (group study), to determine the prevalence of dyslexia profiles (multiple-case study), and to identify the prediction of phonemic segmentation and discrimination skills before reading acquisition on future reading level. Among a group of 373 non-readers seen at age 5, 38 students were subsequently diagnosed as either consistent dyslexic readers (18 DYS) or consistent typical readers (20 TR). Their phonological and lexical reading skills were assessed at ages 10 and 17 and their phonemic segmentation and discrimination skills at age 5. In comparison with TR of the same chronological age (CA-TR), individuals with dyslexia demonstrated an impairment of the two reading routes, especially of the phonological reading route. In the comparison with younger TR (age 10) of the same reading level (RL-TR), only a deficit of the phonological route is observed. In the multiple-case study, the comparisons with CA-TR showed a prevalence of mixed profiles and very few dissociated profiles, whereas the comparison with RL-TR resulted mostly in two profiles depending on the measure: a phonological profile when accuracy was used and a delayed profile when speed was used. In addition, the correlations between early phonemic segmentation and discrimination skills (age 5) and later reading skills (age 17) were significant, and in the group of individuals with dyslexia, early phonemic segmentation skills significantly predicted these later reading skills. Phonological reading deficits are persistent and mainly caused by early phonemic impairments.","### Answer:
- **Target word:** Dyslexia
- **Text A:** The study focuses on the accuracy of teacher judgment in identifying dyslexia based on observations of students in their early schooling years. Dyslexia here is treated as a specific reading difficulty, identifiable and measurable through assessments and teacher input against established criteria of reading, spelling, and intelligence. 
- **Text B:** The second text delves into a more detailed investigation of dyslexia, particularly emphasizing the stability of phonological and lexical deficits, the prevalence of dyslexia profiles, and the predictive power of early phonemic skills on later reading abilities. Dyslexia is examined through various lenses such as phonological deficits, longitudinal studies, and comparison between children diagnosed with dyslexia and their peers. 

- **Label:** Unchanged
- **Reason:** In both texts, dyslexia retains a similar core meaning as a specific learning disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and spelling, grounded in phonological and lexical challenges. The condition is approached scientifically, with efforts to understand its manifestations and impacts over time. The use in both periods focuses on diagnostics, implications for learning, and interventions, without a fundamental shift in the understanding of what dyslexia encompasses."
13,Dyslexia,"Multiple sensory abnormalities have been reported in individuals with developmental dyslexia, especially in the visual and auditory systems. We used gratings of alternating ridges and grooves to investigate tactile perception in this disorder using two tasks: spatial acuity-dependent discrimination of grating orientation and discrimination of gratings varying in ridge width. Compared to age-matched normal subjects, dyslexics were significantly impaired on grating orientation discrimination, with mean thresholds that were nearly twice normal. Unlike normal subjects, their performance on this task was slightly but significantly worse on the dominant hand than on the non-dominant hand. Dyslexics also showed a substantial but non-significant trend for impairment on grating ridge width discrimination. A group of subjects with attention deficit disorder did not differ significantly from normal on any of these measures. These findings expand the range of perceptual deficits reported in developmental dyslexia. Possible explanations for the results, including difficulties with temporal processing, abnormal lateral masking or parietal lobe dysfunction are discussed.","Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder which occurs in childhood but continues to influence academic and occupational function in adulthood. Recently, a Japanese dyslexia questionnaire and diagnostic procedure was established for primary school children. However, there is currently no procedure for the diagnosis or screening of dyslexia in individuals at or above junior high school age; accordingly, we aimed to develop a questionnaire to screen for reading difficulties in those individuals.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" consistently refers to a defined learning disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and decoding text, pointing towards its neurodevelopmental origins and impacts. Text A focuses more on exploring specific perceptual deficits associated with developmental dyslexia, such as tactile perception impairment. On the other hand, Text B addresses the continuation of dyslexia's effects into adulthood and touches on diagnostic approaches for older individuals. Despite differing focuses, both excerpts fundamentally treat dyslexia as a neurodevelopmental condition affecting reading abilities, thus indicating that the core meaning of the term remains unchanged between the time frames."
14,Dyslexia,"This case study concerns a 25-year-old right-handed male patient (G.G.) with post-traumatic lesions involving the right temporal and occipital lobe as well as the basal forebrain of the same side. G.G., who had a visual field defect almost limited to the upper left quadrant, showed both left horizontal and lower vertical neglect dyslexia, disproportionately severe when compared with left and lower visuo-spatial neglect. This is the first case report of a patient whose neglect dyslexia for vertical stimuli depended upon stimulus orientation, i.e., errors affected the final letters of top-down words and the initial letters of the bottom-up ones. This implies that neglect dyslexia can affect the internal letter shape map not only along the horizontal, but also along the vertical axis.","Many children with reading difficulties display phonological deficits and struggle to acquire non-lexical reading skills. However, not all children with reading difficulties have these problems, such as children with selective letter position dyslexia (LPD), who make excessive migration errors (such as reading slime as ""smile""). Previous research has explored three possible loci for the deficit - the phonological output buffer, the orthographic input lexicon, and the orthographic-visual analysis stage of reading. While there is compelling evidence against a phonological output buffer and orthographic input lexicon deficit account of English LPD, the evidence in support of an orthographic-visual analysis deficit is currently limited. In this multiple single-case study with three English-speaking children with developmental LPD, we aimed to both replicate and extend previous findings regarding the locus of impairment in English LPD. First, we ruled out a phonological output buffer and an orthographic input lexicon deficit by administering tasks that directly assess phonological processing and lexical guessing. We then went on to directly assess whether or not children with LPD have an orthographic-visual analysis deficit by modifying two tasks that have previously been used to localize processing at this level: a same-different decision task and a non-word reading task. The results from these tasks indicate that LPD is most likely caused by a deficit specific to the coding of letter positions at the orthographic-visual analysis stage of reading. These findings provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of dyslexia and its underlying causes. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The term ""dyslexia"" in both texts refers to a specific set of reading difficulties characterized by issues with processing word sounds or letter positions. In Text A, the focus is on ""neglect dyslexia,"" a particular subtype involving the misperception or neglect of parts of words depending on their spatial orientation. This type still underlines a problem with reading because of abnormal processing of letters' positions or orientations. In Text B, ""selective letter position dyslexia (LPD)"" is discussed, where the reading difficulty lies with incorrect processing in the coding of letter positions, leading to migration errors like reading ""slime"" as ""smile.""

Despite the slight variations in the specific type and focus (spatial orientation in Text A vs. letter position coding in Text B), both descriptions still revolve around the core definition of dyslexia as a reading disorder involving trouble with proper word or letter recognition and processing. Thus, the essential meaning of ""dyslexia"" as a developmental or acquired difficulty in reading has remained consistent across the two periods represented by the texts."
15,Dyslexia,"The effectiveness of the 'conventional' approach to helping children with dyslexia to acquire literacy has been questioned by Reynolds et al. (Dyslexia 2003). Data are presented in this reply to support the effectiveness of Reading Intervention, a conventional approach to teaching reading delayed children.","Despite over 100 years of research, dyslexia continues to be controversial because of the failure to agree on a definition and underlying causes, as well as the funding implications. This article identifies evidence-based factors that influence the development of reading and may cause difficulties, and the areas of continuing controversy.","###Answer:

This suggests a shift in focus from simply addressing dyslexia as a learning disability to understanding it within a more complex socio-political and scientific context.

- Reason: The meaning and connotation of ""dyslexia"" have shifted from being considered primarily as a specific educational or reading challenge (Text A) to being a topic of broader controversy involving its definition, causes, and broader implications (Text B). This represents a significant change in the discourse surrounding dyslexia, moving from a focus on mitigation through educational approaches to a debate on its fundamental aspects and impact on educational policy and research."
16,Dyslexia,"We examined the frequency of left-handedness, various immune disorders, and comparison disorders in 87 dyslexics and 86 nondyslexics from 14 extended dyslexic families. These families were participants in our genetic linkage studies of dyslexia, which found linkage to chromosome 15 in some families but not others. In the present study, we found a significant elevation of both autoimmune and allergic disorders in the dyslexics only, but no elevation in mixed- or left-handedness in either group. Moreover, the frequency of immune disorders was not higher in the mixed- or left-handed subjects. There was also no elevation in the comparison disorders, which argues against an overreporting bias. The elevation of immune disorders did not vary with linkage status, arguing against a common cause for dyslexia and immune disorders. These findings are discussed in light of Geschwind's hypothesis of a testosterone-mediated association within families between left-handedness, immune disorders, and dyslexia.","Auditory processing of temporal information in speech is sustained by synchronized firing of neurons along the entire auditory pathway. In school-aged children and adults with dyslexia, neural synchronization deficits have been found at cortical levels of the auditory system, however, these deficits do not appear to be present in pre-reading children. An alternative role for subcortical synchronization in reading development and dyslexia has been suggested, but remains debated. By means of a longitudinal study, we assessed cognitive reading-related skills and subcortical auditory steady-state responses (80 Hz ASSRs) in a group of children before formal reading instruction (pre-reading), after 1 year of formal reading instruction (beginning reading), and after 3 years of formal reading instruction (more advanced reading). Children were retrospectively classified into three groups based on family risk and literacy achievement: typically developing children without a family risk for dyslexia, typically developing children with a family risk for dyslexia, and children who developed dyslexia. Our results reveal that children who developed dyslexia demonstrate decreased 80 Hz ASSRs at the pre-reading stage. This effect is no longer present after the onset of reading instruction, due to an atypical developmental increase in 80 Hz ASSRs between the pre-reading and the beginning reading stage. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that literacy achievement was predictable with an accuracy of 90.4% based on a model including three significant predictors, that is, family risk for dyslexia (R = .31), phonological awareness (R = .23), and 80 Hz ASSRs (R = .26). Given that (1) abnormalities in subcortical ASSRs preceded reading acquisition in children who developed dyslexia and (2) subcortical ASSRs contributed to the prediction of literacy achievement, subcortical auditory synchronization deficits may constitute a pre-reading risk factor in the emergence of dyslexia.","- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The focus appears to be on a genetic linkage study involving dyslexics and nondyslexics from extended families. It examines the occurrence of autoimmune and allergic disorders among this group, aimed at exploring potential genetic or physiological relations to dyslexia. The term ""dyslexia"" here relates explicitly to a condition influencing reading and possibly associated with other developmental disorders through genetic or immune system interactions.
- Text B: This text delves into specific auditory processing challenges in individuals with dyslexia, with an emphasis on neural synchronization issues observed in different stages of reading development among children.

The term maintains its usage as a specific developmental disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and possibly connected to other developmental or physiological particulars. The core application of diagnosing, examining, and linking neurodevelopmental or genetic attributes to reading disabilities stays uniform across both texts, suggesting an unchanged meaning in the term even as the angle of exploration evolves."
17,Dyslexia,"Studies of deep dyslexia have conferred prominence upon observations of semantic paralexia (e.g. reading ""town"" as ""city""). Landis et al. (Neuropsychologia 21, 359-364, 1983) have reported evidence indicating that such errors arise in the right hemisphere. However, Marshall and Patterson (Neuropsychologia 21, 425-427, 1983) have advanced both empirical and theoretical arguments against this interpretation: the present paper examines these arguments and finds them seriously flawed. It therefore concludes in favour of the right-hemisphere hypothesis for semantic paralexia.","Developmental disorders of reading and spelling have long been associated with increased left- and mixed-handedness but the evidence has been controversial. The right shift (RS) theory of handedness and cerebral dominance, developed by Annett from 1972 onward, offers resolutions to several puzzles about laterality in the so-called dyslexias. This review of findings in the light of the theory shows that ""phonological"" dyslexics are less likely to be right-handed, while ""surface"" or ""dyseidetic"" dyslexics are more likely to be right-handed than the general population.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: Discusses the neurological aspects of ""deep dyslexia"", focusing particularly on semantic paralexia and associating it with right hemisphere dysfunctions. This description underscores the perspective of dyslexia as largely a neurological impairment affecting semantic processing during reading.
- Text B: Broadens the concept of dyslexia beyond mere neurological issues, discussing it in relation to handedness and cerebral dominance theories. This view incorporates broader cognitive and developmental frameworks to understand dyslexia, highlighting different types of dyslexia and their associations with handedness.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: Between the two texts, the definition and understanding of dyslexia expanded from a primarily neurological condition with specific semantic processing deficits to a multifaceted developmental disorder involving broader aspects such as handedness and cerebral dominance. The shift from a strict neurological focus to a more inclusive, developmental and cognitive perspective indicates a significant semantic drift in the usage and conceptualization of the term ""dyslexia""."
18,Dyslexia,"Functional imaging studies have shown reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in temporal and inferior parietal regions in dyslexia. To relate such abnormalities to the severity of dyslexia, correlations between reading skill and rCBF during a series of reading tasks and visual fixation were mapped for 17 right-handed dyslexic men, ages 18-40, and 14 matched controls. These correlations uniquely identified the left angular gyrus as the most probable site of a functional lesion in dyslexia: Here, higher rCBF was associated with better reading skill in controls (p <.01), but with worse reading skill in dyslexia (p <.01). This suggests that greater reliance on this region normally facilitates reading, but impairs reading in dyslexia. Thus, developmental dyslexia may share a common localization with alexia.","Developmental dyslexia is often accompanied by altered phonological processing of speech. Underlying neural changes have typically been characterized in terms of stimulus- and/or task-related responses within individual brain regions or their functional connectivity. Less is known about potential changes in the more global functional organization of brain networks. Here we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in typical and dyslexic readers while they listened to (a) a random sequence of syllables and (b) a series of tri-syllabic real words. The network topology of the phase synchronization of evoked cortical oscillations was investigated in four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) using minimum spanning tree graphs. We found that, compared to syllable tracking, word tracking triggered a shift toward a more integrated network topology in the theta band in both groups. Importantly, this change was significantly stronger in the dyslexic readers, who also showed increased reliance on a right frontal cluster of electrodes for word tracking. The current findings point towards an altered effect of word-level processing on the functional brain network organization that may be associated with less efficient phonological and reading skills in dyslexia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: Both Text A and Text B, though diverse in their specific contexts and research methodologies, maintain the underlying definition and core concept of ""dyslexia"" relatively consistent over time. Text A focuses on identifying a particular region in the brain associated with dyslexia using imaging studies, discussing the functional aspects that correlate with reading skills. Text B, despite using EEG and emphasizing a different aspect of the neural basis (network topology during phonological processing), still pertains to and elaborates on the core notion of dyslexia as a reading and phonological processing disorder. Both texts explore the neurological and functional differences found in individuals with dyslexia compared to typical readers, signifying that the basic medical and psychological understanding of dyslexia as related to reading and brain function has not undergone a significant semantic shift or drift over the observed period."
19,Dyslexia,"This study aimed at determining whether audiovisual training without linguistic material has a remediating effect on reading skills and central auditory processing in dyslexic children. It was found that this training resulted in plastic changes in the auditory cortex, indexed by enhanced electrophysiological mismatch negativity and faster reaction times to sound changes. Importantly, these changes were accompanied by improvement in reading skills. The results indicate that reading difficulties can be ameliorated by special training programs and, further, that the training effects can be observed in brain activity. Moreover, the fact that the present training effects were obtained by using a program including no linguistic material indicates that dyslexia is at least partly based on a general auditory perceptual deficit.","The aim of this study was to examine whether phonemic decoding skill (deficits of which characterize dyslexia) shares genetic and/or environmental covariance with scholastic abilities independent of general intelligence. Non-word reading ability, verbal and non-verbal IQ, and standardized academic achievement (Queensland Core Skills Test; QCST) were measured in Australian twins (up to 876 twin pairs and 80 singleton twins). Multivariate genetic analysis showed the presence of a general genetic factor, likely reflecting crystallized ability, which accounted for 45-76% of phenotypic variance in QCST scores, 62% of variance in Verbal IQ, 23% of variance in Performance IQ, and 19% of variance in phonological reading ability. The phonemic decoding genetic factor (explaining 48% of variance in phonemic decoding) was negatively associated with mathematical achievement scores (0.4%). Shared effects of common environment did not explain the relationship between reading ability and academic achievement beyond those also influencing IQ. The unique environmental reading factor (accounting for 26% of variance) influenced academic abilities related to written expression. Future research will need to address whether these reading-specific genetic and unique environment relationships arise from causal effects of reading on scholastic abilities, or whether both share a common influence, such as pleiotropic genes/environmental factors.","###Answer:

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The target word ""dyslexia"" retains a consistent meaning across both texts. In Text A, dyslexia is discussed in the context of developmental challenges related to reading skills that can be addressed through specialized training aiming at auditory processing improvement. Text B, meanwhile, explores dyslexia with a focus on the genetic and environmental factors influencing phonemic decoding skills and its covariance with broader academic abilities. Both texts focus on dyslexia as a specific learning difficulty related to the processing of linguistic and phonemic information, despite differences in emphasis and investigational approach. This indicates that the core understanding of ""dyslexia"" as a learning disorder affecting the ability to read has not undergone significant semantic drift over the period between the two texts."
20,Dyslexia,"The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the inhibitory deficits previously found in children with the guessing subtype of dyslexia (who read fast and inaccurately) can be attributed to dysfunctions in the fronto-central brain areas. For this purpose, the electrocortical correlates of the inhibition mechanism were assessed in a stop task that was adapted for event-related brain potential recording. It was found that in children with the spelling subtype of dyslexia (who read slowly and accurately) and normal readers, a positive component with a fronto-central scalp distribution was related to processes engaged in the inhibition of a response. Guessers did not show this ""inhibition P300."" Analyses of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) data suggested that response inhibition in spellers depended (at least in part) on their ability to inhibit the central activation of the response. In guessers, the association between response inhibition and inhibition of activity in the central motor structures was found to be weaker. It was concluded that the inhibitory deficits in guessers can be attributed to dysfunctions in the fronto-central brain structures involved in selective motor inhibition (indicated by the LRP data) and nonselective motor inhibition (indicated by the P300 data). It was suggested that there may be an association between guessers and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder children in that both clinical groups may suffer from the same type of deficits in executive functioning.","Developmental dyslexia in children is one of the neurodevelopmental disorders and is affected by various susceptible genes. In recent years, researchers have found some susceptible genes for dyslexia via chromosome analysis, genome-wide association studies, association analysis, gene function research, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological techniques. This article reviews the research advances in susceptible genes for developmental dyslexia, and with the study on susceptible genes for dyslexia, it lays a foundation for in-depth studies on the ""gene-brain-behavior"" level and provides scientific clues for exploring etiology and pathogenesis of dyslexia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: Both Text A and Text B treat ""dyslexia"" primarily as a neurodevelopmental condition associated with specific biological and neurological factors. In Text A, dyslexia is discussed within the context of inhibitory deficits found in subtypes of dyslexia, and the involvement of specific brain areas. Similarly, Text B speaks about dyslexia in terms of its genetic susceptibility, research advances regarding these genes, and implications for understanding the disorder at a ""gene-brain-behavior"" level. There is no significant shift in the fundamental understanding or conceptualization of dyslexia; both texts view it through a scientific, medical lens focusing on neurological and genetic aspects. Therefore, the use of the word ""dyslexia"" has remained unchanged over the periods discussed in the texts."
21,Dyslexia,"It is generally accepted that dyslexia should be identified early for interventions to have maximum effect. However, when children speak English as an additional language (EAL), diagnosis is more complex and there is concern that these children tend to be under-identified. This paper reports a longitudinal study following the development of phonological awareness skills in relation to progress in learning to read with a cohort of British Asian children learning EAL and their monolingual peers. It also sought to determine the usefulness of a measure of phonological skills for the identification of dyslexic-type difficulties in children learning EAL. Analysis revealed that both cohorts achieved similar levels of reading accuracy in school Years 2, 4 and 6, with higher levels of reading comprehension for the monolingual children and faster reading fluency for children learning EAL in each school year. There was a similar pattern of relationships between the reading measures and measures of phonological awareness for both groups of children. However, monolingual children achieved higher levels of rhyme detection and alliteration fluency whilst the children learning EAL achieved faster number naming times. Overall, a phonological assessment battery was useful in identifying reading accuracy related difficulties in both groups of children. However, concerns are raised about the sensitivity of such measures following the introduction of the Literacy Hour.",Within the past decade tremendous advances have occurred in our understanding of dyslexia.,"### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: This text discusses a study focusing on the diagnosis of dyslexia in children, particularly of those from a non-English speaking background. It addresses the challenges of diagnosing dyslexia in children who speak English as an additional language (EAL), emphasizing the complexity and potential under-identification of such cases. The text also explores how dyslexia relates to phonological awareness skills and reading development over a longitudinal study.
- Text B: This passage briefly mentions recent significant advancements in the understanding of dyslexia, implying that there have been conceptual or scientific advancements without going into specific details about these changes or new insights.

### Label: Unchanged
### Reason:
The meaning of the word ""dyslexia"" in both texts remains associated with a learning disorder characterized by difficulties with reading, writing, and spelling. Though the contexts differ — one detailed about diagnostic challenges and educational impact, and the other hinting at broader scientific advancements — there is no significant shift in the core meaning of ""dyslexia"" itself between the two texts. Both usages maintain the understanding of dyslexia as a specific learning difficulty despite different levels of depth in discussing it."
22,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is now generally acknowledged to involve difficulties in phonological processing. However, the links between reading difficulties and speech difficulties remain unclear.","Visual speech inputs can enhance auditory speech information, particularly in noisy or degraded conditions. The natural statistics of audiovisual speech highlight the temporal correspondence between visual and auditory prosody, with lip, jaw, cheek and head movements conveying information about the speech envelope. Low-frequency spatial and temporal modulations in the 2-7 Hz range are of particular importance. Dyslexic individuals have specific problems in perceiving speech envelope cues. In the current study, we used an audiovisual noise-vocoded speech task to investigate the contribution of low-frequency visual information to intelligibility of 4-channel and 16-channel noise vocoded speech in participants with and without dyslexia. For the 4-channel speech, noise vocoding preserves amplitude information that is entirely congruent with dynamic visual information. All participants were significantly more accurate with 4-channel speech when visual information was present, even when this information was purely spatio-temporal (pixelated stimuli changing in luminance). Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" refers to issues associated with processing speech or language inputs, albeit with a focus on different aspects or scientific findings. Text A discusses dyslexia in the context of difficulties in phonological processing linking it to reading difficulties, which is consistent with the traditional understanding of dyslexia as a learning disorder affecting the ability to read, process, and understand texts. Text B extends the discussion into the realm of how individuals with dyslexia perceive speech cues, particularly through a multi-modal (audiovisual) framework. Though the focus shifts slightly towards the mechanisms of audiovisual interaction in perception, the core concept of dyslexia as a cognitive condition affecting the interpretation of linguistic cues remains consistent. Hence, there is no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of the word ""dyslexia"" between the two texts, indicating the meaning has remained largely unchanged over the time period."
23,Dyslexia,"Functional imaging studies of developmental dyslexia have reported reduced task-related neural activity in the temporal and inferior parietal cortices. To examine the possible contribution of subtle anatomic deviations to these reductions, volumes were measured for the major lobes of the brain, the subcortical nuclei, cerebellum, and lateral ventricles on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 16 right-handed dyslexic men, ages 18 to 40, and 14 matched controls, most of whom had previously undergone PET imaging. A specific decrease in tissue volume was localized to the temporal lobes and was particularly prominent on the left (p < .01). An analysis of tissue composition revealed that this reduction was primarily attributable to decreased gray matter within the left temporal lobe (p < .002). Further segmentation of the temporal lobe showed that this reduction was not confined to the superior temporal gyrus, the primary location of primary auditory cortex. Reductions of temporal lobe gray matter may reflect a regional decrease in neuronal number or neuropil, which in turn may result in reading impairment.","Developmental dyslexia, an unexplained difficulty in learning to read, has been associated with alterations in white matter organization as measured by diffusion-weighted imaging. It is unknown, however, whether these differences in structural connectivity are related to the cause of dyslexia or if they are consequences of reading difficulty (e.g., less reading experience or compensatory brain organization). Here, in 40 kindergartners who had received little or no reading instruction, we examined the relation between behavioral predictors of dyslexia and white matter organization in left arcuate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the parietal portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus using probabilistic tractography. Higher composite phonological awareness scores were significantly and positively correlated with the volume of the arcuate fasciculus, but not with other tracts. Two other behavioral predictors of dyslexia, rapid naming and letter knowledge, did not correlate with volumes or diffusion values in these tracts. The volume and fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate showed a particularly strong positive correlation with a phoneme blending test. Whole-brain regressions of behavioral scores with diffusion measures confirmed the unique relation between phonological awareness and the left arcuate. These findings indicate that the left arcuate fasciculus, which connects anterior and posterior language regions of the human brain and which has been previously associated with reading ability in older individuals, is already smaller and has less integrity in kindergartners who are at risk for dyslexia because of poor phonological awareness. These findings suggest a structural basis of behavioral risk for dyslexia that predates reading instruction. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Dyslexia"" focuses on the neurological and structural differences associated with the condition and its impact on reading abilities. Text A discusses how anatomical deviations in brain regions (particularly the left temporal lobe) relate to reading impairments, while Text B explores how structural connectivity, specifically in certain brain tracts, correlates with behavioral predictors of dyslexia even before reading instruction begins. Thus, the conceptual framework surrounding ""dyslexia"" as a learning disability linked to physical brain structure remains consistent over the years, emphasizing its characteristic impacts on reading skills across different neuroimaging and behavioral analysis studies."
24,Dyslexia,"A cohort of ordinary Swedish children were followed up from school entry through childhood and adolescence and checked retrospectively from birth to the age of 6 years regarding psychiatric and physical health and contact with the social welfare authorities. The children were allocated to different risk groups at age 7 on the basis of their psycho-physical development expressed as complex reaction time (CRT). It was previously shown that many of the slow CRT children have problems in psychomotor and language development at school, and that many leave compulsory school with poor achievements in Swedish and gymnastics as continuing signs of their developmental delay. This study shows that slow CRT children have an increased prevalence of child psychiatric problems. At an early age there were symptoms of aggression, hyperactivity and withdrawal in conjunction with developmental delay. During adolescence, depression, maladjustment and psycho-somatic disorders were prominent features, often in association with developmental delay, dyslexia and poor motoric skill. These children could have a disadvantage at school and in society and they felt themselves ""handicapped"" and were stressed by feelings of limited future possibilities. In adolescence, many of them were in need of help, especially financial aid from the social welfare services. The findings stress that a slow cognitive processing ability seen as a slow CRT must be considered a handicap of importance and a risk-factor in the society of today, with primary or secondary psychic and social manifestations often in a multifactorial setting of biological co-morbidity and family problems. In contrast, an advanced CNS development with a fast CRT may be seen as a protective factor.","Cognitive neuropsychological models (CNMs) have been useful to generate a theory of aphasia rehabilitation. In contrast to the traditional syndrome approach, CNMs employ cognitive accounts to interpret language disturbances after brain damage. In this article, we apply CNMs to monolingual Spanish and bilingual Spanish-English readers with acquired dyslexia whose first language is Spanish. Although there are many studies of acquired dyslexia (reading errors associated with aphasia), they primarily have focused on English and French readers. Similar investigations on Spanish readers are limited. Unlike the opaque orthographic systems of English and French (inconsistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships), Spanish has a mostly transparent orthography (regular grapheme-to-phoneme relationships). Thus evaluating and treating dyslexia secondary to brain damage in Spanish readers may involve different strategies from those employed with English and French readers. The increasingly large numbers of Spanish speakers in aphasia rehabilitation worldwide underscore the critical need to develop plausible theoretically grounded clinical strategies to serve these individuals.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""dyslexia"" continues to refer to specific reading and language-related difficulties. Text A focuses on developmental dyslexia as a broad learning disability impacting school achievements and psycho-physical development. Text B discusses acquired dyslexia, specifically due to aphasia or brain damage, and how it affects reading abilities in bilingual contexts. While the specifics of the affected population and the nature of the dyslexia (developmental vs. acquired) differ, the fundamental meaning of the word as a condition affecting reading capabilities remains stable across the two texts. In both cases, dyslexia is treated as a specific type of impairment with educational and rehabilitation implications, maintaining a consistent core meaning over the periods compared."
25,Dyslexia,"This case study examined phonemic reading and reading comprehension in the presence of Broca's aphasia. The patient, T.B., a 16 yr old male, suffered an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Spontaneous speech was limited, naming difficulties were apparent, and comprehension was mildly impaired. Though the patient could read only a small number of words aloud, he was able to read silently for comprehension on a standardized instrument. Moreover, T.B. was able to match orally-presented pseudowords to their written analogs, a finding which suggests that phonemic processing for nonlexical material was to some degree intact. The results were contrasted to the reading patterns usually reported to be present in ""frontal"" alexia and deep dyslexia. The possible existence of a dissociation between phonemic processing in reading and speech behavior as well as its mechanism was discussed.","Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder manifested in deficits in reading and spelling skills that is consistently associated with difficulties in phonological processing. Dyslexia is genetically transmitted, but its manifestation in a particular individual is thought to depend on the interaction of epigenetic and environmental factors. We adopt a novel interactional perspective on early linguistic environment and dyslexia by simultaneously studying two pre-existing factors, one maternal and one infant, that may contribute to these interactions; and two behaviours, one maternal and one infant, to index the effect of these factors. The maternal factor is whether mothers are themselves dyslexic or not (with/without dyslexia) and the infant factor is whether infants are at-/not-at family risk for dyslexia (due to their mother or father being dyslexic). The maternal behaviour is mothers' infant-directed speech (IDS), which typically involves vowel hyperarticulation, thought to benefit speech perception and language acquisition. The infant behaviour is auditory perception measured by infant sensitivity to amplitude envelope rise time, which has been found to be reduced in dyslexic children. Here, at-risk infants showed significantly poorer acoustic sensitivity than not-at-risk infants and mothers only hyperarticulated vowels to infants who were not at-risk for dyslexia. Mothers' own dyslexia status had no effect on IDS quality. Parental speech input is thus affected by infant risk status, with likely consequences for later linguistic development.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" consistently refers to a reading disorder that affects reading and spelling skills. Text A discusses the reading patterns in a patient with Broca's aphasia that may also be related to dyslexia, while Text B focuses on the genetic and environmental factors contributing to dyslexia, along with its impact on phonological processing and early language development. Despite the differing focus and scope of research, the fundamental definition of dyslexia as a disorder related to reading difficulties remains the same across both periods. Thus, the semantic use of the word 'dyslexia' remains unchanged between the two texts."
26,Dyslexia,"There is widespread support for the notion that subgroups of dyslexics can be identified who differ in their reading profiles: Developmental phonological dyslexia is characterized by poor nonword reading, while developmental surface dyslexia is distinguished by a particular difficulty in reading irregular words. However, there is much less agreement about how these subtypes, and particularly the surface dyslexic pattern, are to be accounted for within theoretical models of the reading system. To assist in addressing this issue, the heritability of reading deficits in dyslexic subtypes was examined using a twin sample. Subjects' scores on (a) an exception word reading task and (b) a nonword reading task were used to create a subtype dimension, and surface and phonological dyslexic subgroups were selected from the ends of this distribution. Reading deficits were found to be significantly heritable in both subgroups. However, the genetic contribution to the group reading deficit was much greater in the phonological dyslexics than in the surface dyslexics. The finding of differential genetic etiology across subtypes suggests that there is at least partial independence in the development of the cognitive processes involved in reading exception words and nonwords. Also, the results support accounts of surface dyslexia which emphasize a strong environmental contribution.","Psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence, in particular attention deficit disorder or specific learning disorders like developmental dyslexia and developmental dyscalculia, affect academic performance and learning at school. Recent advances in neuroscientific research have incited an intensive debate both in the general public and in the field of educational and instructional science as well as to whether and to what extent these new findings in the field of neuroscience might be of importance for school-related learning and instruction. In this review, we first summarize neuroscientific findings related to the development of attention, working memory and executive functions in typically developing children and then evaluate their relevance for school-related learning. We present an overview of neuroimaging studies of specific learning disabilities such as developmental dyslexia and developmental dyscalculia, and critically discuss their practical implications for educational and teaching practice, teacher training, early diagnosis as well as prevention and disorder-specific therapy. We conclude that the new interdisciplinary field of neuroeducation cannot be expected to provide direct innovative educational applications (e.g., teaching methods). Rather, the future potential of neuroscience lies in creating a deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms and pathomechanisms of learning processes and learning disorders. ","###Answer:

- Text A: In this text, dyslexia is discussed primarily in relation to its subtypes—phonological and surface dyslexia. These discussions are rooted in exploring how different dyslexics might show different patterns in reading irregular words and nonwords, considering genetic and environmental factors in their etiology. The text focuses on the theoretical models of reading and the inheritability of dyslexia subtypes.
- Text B: Here, dyslexia is mentioned as part of a broader discussion on psychiatric disorders affecting education, particularly focusing on childhood and adolescence challenges. The text extends into how neuroscientific advances could impact learning and education settings, specifically highlighting dyslexia’s implications for neuroeducation and the broader understanding of learning disabilities.

###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
Both texts, despite their different emphases and scopes, essentially align in viewing dyslexia as a learning disorder characterized by challenges in reading. Text A delves into a more detailed analysis of dyslexia's subtypes and genetic factors, while Text B places dyslexia within the context of educational impacts and neuroscientific research advancements. Thus, the core understanding and representation of ""dyslexia"" as a term referring to a specific learning disability remain consistent between both texts, indicating no significant semantic drift. The term retains its medical and educational significance over the observed period, focusing on reading difficulties, though the discussions around it have expanded in scope and detail."
27,Dyslexia,"Selective and sustained visual attention were tested in 29 boys with developmental dyslexia and 28 normal spellers (also boys) matched for age, grade in school, I.Q. and other developmental parameters. The developmental dyslexia group had deficits in selective attention. A significant effect of task difficulty was found. There was no dysfunction in sustained attention.","The present findings are drawn from the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia (JLD), in which approximately 100 children with familial risk of dyslexia and 100 control children have been followed from birth. In this paper we report data on the reading development of the JLD children and their classmates, a total of 1,750 children from four measurement points during the first two school years. In the total sample, we examined whether heterogeneous developmental paths can be identified based on profiles of word recognition and reading comprehension. Secondly, we studied what kind of early language and literacy skill profiles and reading experiences characterize the children with differing reading development in the follow-up sample. The mixture modeling procedure resulted in five subtypes: (1) poor readers, (2) slow decoders, (3) poor comprehenders, (4) average readers, and (5) good readers. The children with familial risk for dyslexia performed on average at a lower level in all reading tasks than both their classmates and the controls, and they were overrepresented in slow decoders subtype. Differences between the subtypes were found in the early language and literacy skill development, as well as in the reading experiences of the reading subtypes.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" refers to a specific learning disability characterized by difficulties in reading and spelling, despite normal intelligence. Text A focuses on attention issues within a group identified with developmental dyslexia, whereas Text B outlines a broader longitudinal study but still targets dyslexia as a condition affecting reading and associated cognitive processes. Neither text departs from the established medical and educational understanding of dyslexia as a learning disorder related primarily to reading skills. Hence, the semantic context of ""dyslexia"" remains constant across both periods."
28,Dyslexia,"Material is presented from three analyses involving the impact on adult functioning of childhood trauma to the visual system. The clinical process by which unrecognized but ongoing traumatic reactions are identified for subsequent analysis is described. It is of particular importance, with these patients, to recognize their lifelong experience of visual confusion resulting from problems in their visual anatomy. Only then can fantasies and affects related to these physically induced states of confusion be worked through. Working through these reactions promotes the neutralization of related primitive narcissistic affects, mourning, and realistic accommodation, and leads to a more intact and integrated sense of self, and a marked increase in self-esteem. With this newly integrated sense of self, the complex interaction between physically induced confusion states and more typical developmental conflicts with objects can be worked through, resulting in more realistic and intense cathexes of the external world. The trauma suffered by these patients had been greatly compounded by its having gone unrecognized. To miss this yet again in an analysis is to repeat the past and retraumatize the patient. These findings have clear implications for patients with other biologically related symptoms (e.g., ADD, ADHD, and dyslexia).","DYX1C1 (DNAAF4) and DCDC2 are two of the most replicated dyslexia candidate genes in genetic studies. They both have demonstrated roles in neuronal migration, in cilia growth and function and they both are cytoskeletal interactors. In addition, they both have been characterized as ciliopathy genes. However, their exact molecular functions are still incompletely described. Based on these known roles, we asked whether DYX1C1 and DCDC2 interact on the genetic and the protein level.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used consistent with its established meaning as a specific learning disability, particularly affecting reading and related language-based processing skills. Text A discusses dyslexia in the context of broader biologically-related symptoms and their impact on trauma and patient analysis, emphasizing the psychological and developmental aspects associated with dyslexia. Text B explores dyslexia from a genetic perspective, investigating the roles of specific genes associated with the condition. Despite different focuses—one on clinical-psychological implications and the other on genetic research—the core concept of dyslexia as a learning disability remains unchanged between the texts. Both contexts relate directly to the symptomatic manifestations and underlying biological factors of dyslexia, indicating that the meaning of the word has not drifted significantly over time."
29,Dyslexia,"The articulatory awareness task, which was found by Griffiths and Frith (2002) to discriminate ex-dyslexic from non-dyslexic adults, was given to three groups of Japanese college students with different English reading abilities. Two unexpected results emerged: (1) Articulatory awareness performance was generally poor across the groups, thereby suggesting that poor articulatory awareness is not unique to dyslexia but rather to reading difficulty in general, and (2) There was a weak but significant positive correlation between articulatory awareness and English reading ability. Implications are that while articulatory awareness may not function only in dyslexia, it is embedded in a complex information-processing network involving reading acquisition. Specifically, a revised Articulatory Awareness Deficit Hypothesis is formulated, which states that poor articulatory awareness is part of articulation difficulty associated with poor phonological awareness that in turn tends to underlie dyslexia and reading difficulty.","It is generally accepted that dyslexia arises due to deficits in phonological processing. However, whether these deficits are based on impaired auditory processing is still subject to debate. Here we tested whether low level auditory processing is correlated with a simple phonological processing task, thus indicating a close relationship between higher sensory and lower cognitive processing.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: Discusses the broader implications of dyslexia, not solely focusing on a neurological or genetic view, but also exploring cognitive processing difficulties related to reading, such as articulatory awareness. The text suggests that dyslexia may be connected to broader reading difficulties not necessarily exclusive to the medical condition of dyslexia.

Despite apparent variations in focus and depth, both Text A and Text B deal with dyslexia in the context of cognitive and phonological processing deficits. Text A looks into cognitive aspects that affect reading which are associated with dyslexia, while Text B emphasizes the sensory processing defects linked to dyslexia. Both texts are unified by the notion that dyslexia involves difficulty with certain processing tasks (either sensory or cognitive), supporting the understanding of dyslexia as a complex reading and processing disorder. Thus, the essence of the meaning of ""dyslexia"" as related to reading and processing difficulties remains stable across the years in these examples."
30,Dyslexia,"Neuroimaging studies of neurobehavioral disorders are using new imaging modalities. In dyslexia, anatomic imaging studies demonstrate an abnormal symmetry of the planum temporale. Functional imaging supports the hypothesis that developmental dyslexia is frequently the result of deficits in phonologic processing and that normal reading requires a patent network organization of a number of anterior and posterior brain areas. In autism, anatomic imaging studies are conflicting. Functional imaging demonstrates temporal lobe abnormalities and abnormal interaction between frontal and parietal brain areas. In attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, imaging studies suggest an abnormality in the prefrontal and striatal regions. Neuroimaging studies are often contradictory, but trends, especially with functional imaging analysis, are evolving. Because neurobehavioral disorders seem to be a result of a dysfunction in brain circuits, no one region will be abnormal in all patients studied. Further studies with well-defined patient populations and appropriate activation paradigms will better elucidate the pathophysiology of these conditions.","No clinically proven method currently exists to determine if a test taker is feigning or exaggerating symptoms of a specific reading disability (RD) for potential secondary gain (i.e., extra time on examinations, access to bursary funds, or tax benefits). Our objective was to examine the utility of previously proposed symptom validity measures (i.e., the Dyslexia Assessment of Simulation or Honesty [DASH] and the resulting Feigning Index [FI]) in discriminating students with genuine RDs from sophisticated simulators given ample time to prepare, who were warned that noncredible performance could be detected. The DASH correctly classified almost 83% of coached simulators with no false positives. The FI accurately classified 86% of post-secondary students feigning RD without misidentifying any students with a genuine RD, resulting in 91.8% overall classification accuracy. These two methods show promise as a means of detecting noncredible performance in the assessment of RD.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A describes dyslexia primarily in a clinical and neurobiological context, focusing on imaging studies related to neurobehavioral disorders, which indicate that developmental dyslexia results from deficits in phonologic processing involving multiple brain areas.
- Text B shifts the focus of dyslexia towards educational and forensic psychology by discussing the issue of individuals possibly feigning reading disabilities for secondary gains, such as extra examination time or financial benefits. It explores diagnostic tools designed to differentiate between genuine and feigned cases of dyslexia.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The context and implications of the term ""dyslexia"" have significantly expanded from Text A to Text B. Initially focused on clinical and neuroradiological aspects (Text A), it later encompasses concerns about the authenticity of dyslexia claims in educational and testing contexts (Text B), showing a shift in the practical application and socio-educational considerations of the term."
31,Dyslexia,"Since the time of Javal, it has been well established that normal reading eye movement patterns have 3 principal components: (1) small saccades that move the eyes from word to word, (2) large saccades that return the eyes to the beginning of the next line, and (3) fixation pauses between each saccade for information processing. We discuss the vision analysis results and show the quantitative reading eye movement records, measured with the infrared photoelectric method, of 5 patients examined in the Neuro-optometry Clinic. The reading records showed a wide variety of behavior: 1 patient performed normal reading movements, 1 ""slow reader"" manifested an excessive number of fixations as well as extended fixational durations, another ""slow"" reader only exhibited an excessive number of fixations, a patient with dyslexia performed backward reading movements, and 1 patient exhibited nystagmus superimposed upon the reading pattern.","Primary education is the incubator for learning academic skills that help children to become a literate, communicative, and independent person. Over this learning period, nonlinear and regional changes in the brain occur, but how these changes relate to academic performance, such as reading ability, is still unclear. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal T1 MRI data of 41 children in order to investigate typical cortical development during the early reading stage (end of kindergarten-end of grade 2) and advanced reading stage (end of grade 2-middle of grade 5), and to detect putative deviant trajectories in children with dyslexia. The structural brain change was quantified with a reliable measure that directly calculates the local morphological differences between brain images of two time points, while considering the global head growth. When applying this measure to investigate typical cortical development, we observed that left temporal and temporoparietal regions belonging to the reading network exhibited an increase during the early reading stage and stabilized during the advanced reading stage. This suggests that the natural plasticity window for reading is within the first years of primary school, hence earlier than the typical period for reading intervention. Concerning neurotrajectories in children with dyslexia compared to typical readers, we observed no differences in gray matter development of the left reading network, but we found different neurotrajectories in right IFG opercularis (during the early reading stage) and in right isthmus cingulate (during the advanced reading stage), which could reflect compensatory neural mechanisms.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is consistently used to refer to a specific reading disorder characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, poor spelling, and decoding abilities. Text A describes the specific symptoms shown by a dyslexic individual during eye movement analysis related to reading patterns, demonstrating a detailed study on how dyslexia affects reading movements. Text B, while discussing longitudinal studies and brain imaging associated with dyslexia, still centers on the condition's impact on reading abilities and brain developments in affected children. Despite the advances in neuroimaging and understanding of the brain detailed in Text B, the basic understanding and description of dyslexia remain similar to Text A. Thus, the word ""dyslexia"" has not undergone a significant semantic shift and is consistently used in the context of a reading disorder.

32,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia has long been defined by deficit. Nevertheless, the view that visual-spatial talents accompany dyslexia has grown, due to reports of individuals with dyslexia who possess visual-spatial strengths, findings of elevated incidence of dyslexia in certain visual-spatial professions, and the hypothesis that left-hemisphere deficits accompany right-hemisphere strengths. Studies have reported superior, inferior, and average levels of visual-spatial abilities associated with dyslexia. In two investigations, we found an association between dyslexia and speed of recognition of impossible figures, a global visual-spatial task. This finding suggests that dyslexia is associated with a particular type of visual-spatial talent-enhanced ability to process visual-spatial information globally (holistically) rather than locally (part by part).","Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with complex genetic mechanisms. A number of candidate genes have been identified, some of which are linked to neuronal development and migration and to ciliary functions. However, expression and regulation of these genes in human brain development and neuronal differentiation remain uncharted. Here, we used human long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem (lt-NES, here termed NES) cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to study neuronal differentiation in vitro. We characterized gene expression changes during differentiation by using RNA sequencing and validated dynamics for selected genes by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, we found that genes related to cilia were significantly enriched among upregulated genes during differentiation, including genes linked to ciliopathies with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We confirmed the presence of primary cilia throughout neuronal differentiation. Focusing on dyslexia candidate genes, 33 out of 50 DD candidate genes were detected in NES cells by RNA sequencing, and seven candidate genes were upregulated during differentiation to neurons, including DYX1C1 (DNAAF4), a highly replicated DD candidate gene. Our results suggest a role of ciliary genes in differentiating neuronal cells and show that NES cells provide a relevant human neuronal model to study ciliary and DD candidate genes.","- Target word: Dyslexia

- Text A: Dyslexia in this context is discussed predominantly from the standpoint of its symptomatic and visual-spatial manifestations within individuals, exploring how dyslexia may convey specific visual-spatial strengths—which can be perceived as talents or exceptional skills in particular areas despite the usual challenges that come with the condition.

- Text B: This text speaks to dyslexia from a scientific research angle, primarily focusing on its genetic and neurodevelopmental aspects. The mention of candidate genes and their implication in the development of dyslexia highlights the ongoing exploration into the biological and genetic underpinnings of the condition. This biological perspective is rich with detail about the processes and potential implications for future therapies and understanding the condition at a more molecular level.

- Label: Changed

- Reason: The usage of the word 'dyslexia' has shown a perceptible shift from a more symptomatic and skills-oriented view in Text A to a deeply genetic and biological understanding in Text B. The earlier perception, which includes potential visual-spatial strengths, contrasts with the later scientific research focus, which delves into genetic factors and neurodevelopment. Therefore, the semantic drift here is marked by a movement from practical manifestations and individual experiences to genetic research and biological exploration, indicating a more holistic and scientifically nuanced understanding of 'dyslexia'."
33,Dyslexia,"The importance of genetic influences on cognitive disability has been recognized for a long time, but molecular analysis has only recently begun to yield insights into the pathogenesis of this common and disabling condition. The availability of genome sequences has enabled the characterization of the chromosomal deletions and trisomies that result in cognitive disability, and mutations in rare single-gene conditions are being discovered. The molecular pathology of cognitive disability is turning out to be as heterogeneous as the condition itself, with unexpected complexities even in apparently simple gene-deletion syndromes. One remarkable finding from studies on X-linked mental retardation is that mutations in different small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins result in cognitive disability without other somatic features. Advances are also being made in cognitive disability with polygenic origins, such as dyslexia and autism. However, the genetic basis of mild intellectual disability has yet to be satisfactorily explained.","The present study addressed auditory processing in 8-11-year-old children with developmental dyslexia by means of event-related brain potentials (ERP). Cortical sound reception was evaluated by recording N250 responses to syllables and tones and cortical sound discrimination by analyzing the mismatch negativity (MMN) to syllable and tone changes. We found that both cortical sound reception and sound discrimination were impaired in dyslexic children. The analysis of the data obtained from two dyslexic subgroups, Dyslexics-1 being impaired in non-word reading (or both non-word and frequent word reading) and Dyslexics-2 in frequent word reading but not in non-word reading, revealed that the MMN was specifically diminished in the latter group whereas it was normal-like in Dyslexics-1. However, no differences were found between these subgroups in sound reception as indicated by the responses elicited by the standard stimuli. These results show that different diagnostic subgroups of dyslexics have different patterns of auditory processing deficits as suggested by similarly impaired sound reception in both dyslexic groups and the sound-discrimination impairment specific to one of the groups.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The usage and context of the word ""dyslexia"" in both Text A and Text B revolve around it as a developmental or cognitive disorder affecting specific cognitive abilities, primarily related to reading and language processing. Text A discusses dyslexia in the broader context of genetic factors impacting cognitive disabilities, including dyslexia. Text B delves deeper into the specific auditory processing deficits in children diagnosed with developmental dyslexia, using electrophysiological measurements (ERP).

In both cases, ""dyslexia"" retains its meaning as a type of learning disability characterized by difficulty in reading, with no significant drift towards a fundamentally different conceptual interpretation over the time period between the two texts. Both texts treat dyslexia as a complex condition warranting detailed study to understand its manifestations better. Thus, the core semantic essence of ""dyslexia"" remains consistent."
34,Dyslexia,"There is evidence for genetic contributions to reading disability, but the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with the clinical diagnosis may make identification of the underlying genetic basis difficult. In order to elucidate distinct phenotypic features that may be contributing to the genotypic heterogeneity, we assessed the familial aggregation patterns of Verbal IQ and 24 phenotypic measures associated with dyslexia in 102 nuclear families ascertained through probands in grades 1 through 6 who met the criteria for this disorder. Correlations between relatives were computed for all diagnostic phenotypes, using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. GEE is a recently developed semiparametric method for handling correlated data. The method is robust to model misspecification and flexible in adjusting for the subjects' characteristics and pedigree sizes as well as for the ascertainment process, while estimating the correlations between related subjects. The Nonword Memory (NWM) subtest of a prepublication version of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) subtest of a prepublication version of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) showed correlation patterns in relatives that are strongly supportive of a genetic basis. The Wechsler Scale Digit Span, the Word Attack subtest of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test--Revised, and the Spelling subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test--Third Edition had slightly weaker evidence of a genetic basis. Five additional phenotypes (the Spelling subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, the Accuracy, Rate, and Comprehension subtests of the Gray Oral Reading Test--Third Edition, and Rapid Automatized Naming of Letters and Numbers) gave suggestive evidence of such a pattern. The results cross-validate in that evidence for a pattern consistent with a genetic basis was obtained for two measures of phonological short-term memory (CTOPP Nonword Memory and WISCIII or WAIS-R Digit Span), for two measures of phonological decoding (WRMT-R Word Attack and TOWRE Phonemic Decoding Efficiency), and for two measures of spelling from dictation (WRAT-3 Spelling and, to a lesser extent, WIAT Spelling). These measures are thus good candidates for more sophisticated segregation analyses that can formulate models for incorporation into linkage analyses.","Numerous studies have focused on the understanding of rapid automatized naming (RAN), which can be applied to predict reading abilities and developmental dyslexia in children. Eye tracking technique, characterizing the essential ocular activities, might have the feasibility to reveal the visual and cognitive features of RAN. However, traditional measures of eye movements ignore many dynamical details about the visual and cognitive processing of RAN, and are usually associated with the duration of time spent on some particular areas of interest, fixation counts, revisited fixation counts, saccadic velocities, or saccadic amplitudes. To cope with this drawback, we suggested an entropy-based method to measure eye movements for the first time, which first mapped eye movements during RAN in a time-series and then analyzed the time-series by a proper definition of entropy from the perspective of information theory. Our findings showed that the entropy was more sensitive to reflect small perturbation (e.g., rapid movements between focuses in the presence of skipping or omitting some stimulus during RAN) of eye movements, and thus gained better performance than traditional measures. We also verified that the entropy of eye movements significantly deceased with the age and the task complexity of RAN, and significantly correlated with traditional eye-movement measures [e.g., total time of naming (TTN)] and the RAN-related skills [e.g., selective attention (SA), cognitive speed, and visual-motor integration]. Our findings may bring some new insights into the understanding of both RAN and eye tracking technique itself.","###Answer

- **Target word**: Dyslexia
- **Text A** discusses dyslexia primarily from a genetic and phenotypic perspective. The text explores the correlation between various cognitive tests and dyslexia, emphasizing genetic contributions to the disorder and suggesting certain cognitive tests as tools for further genetic studies related to dyslexia.
- **Text B** shifts focus towards the relationship between eye movements and dyslexia, particularly using rapid automatized naming (RAN) and novel entropy-based methods to analyze eye movements. This approach is aimed at understanding the visual and cognitive processes involved in dyslexia and how these can be quantified or studied innovatively.
  
- **Label**: Changed

- **Reason**: While both texts discuss dyslexia within a scientific framework, the shift from a predominantly genetic and phenotype-focused discourse in Text A to a more technologically oriented analysis involving eye tracking and information theory in Text B indicates a significant change. This reflects an evolution in the research focus from internal genetic factors to incorporating more external, measurement-based methodologies understanding and diagnosing the disorder. Thus, the semantic context in which 'dyslexia' is discussed has changed, indicating a significant semantic drift in its scholarly treatment."
35,Dyslexia,"This paper reviews what is known about developmental dyslexia at three levels of analysis: cognitive, neurological, and genetic. It also considers the difficult problem of establishing causal links between these levels of analysis, and argues that solving the gene-behavior problem is paradoxically easier than solving the brain-behavior problem.","Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral cortex alterations; however, recent evidence also points toward sensory thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is highly correlated with reading proficiency. Here, we tested two hypotheses that were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the auditory-motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT). Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging-based probabilistic tracking, we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with faster RANln scores in dyslexics, but was in neurotypical readers. Our findings provide the first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia and it may also affect reading-related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.","### Answer:

Therefore, the semantic core of the word ""dyslexia"" remains unchanged."
36,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is a common and genetically complex trait that manifests primarily as a reading disability independent of general intelligence and educational opportunity. Strong evidence for a dyslexia susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p34-p36 (near marker D1S199) was recently reported, and an earlier study found suggestive evidence for linkage to the same region. We tested for the presence of a dyslexia gene in this region in a sample of 100 Canadian families using both qualitative and quantitative definitions of the phenotype. Using a qualitative definition of dyslexia (affected, unaffected, or uncertain), the largest multipoint Genehunter Maximum LOD-Score (MLS) in 100 core nuclear families was 3.65 at D1S507, distal to D1S199. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) linkage analysis was performed for four measures of dyslexia (phonological awareness, phonological coding, spelling, and rapid automatized naming speed) employing the variance components approach implemented in Genehunter. Using a model with QTL additive and dominance variance and polygenic additive variance, the multipoint LOD scores maximized proximal to D1S199 (between D1S552 and D1S1622), with peaks of 4.01 for spelling and 1.65 for phonological coding (corresponding LOD scores under 1 degree of freedom were 3.30 and 1.13, respectively). In conclusion, our study confirms and strengthens recent findings of a dyslexia susceptibility gene on chromosome 1p34-p36 (now designated DYX8).","We suggest that the American poet E.E. Cummings was probably mildly dyslexic. Evidence, which is drawn in particular from inspection of his archival papers, includes consideration of his spelling, letter formation, handwriting, approach to page orientation, proclivity for exploration of the mirror-image, reading and educational history, struggles in the composition of analytical prose, and notable strengths in lateral thinking and the making of surprising lateral connections. We emphasise the importance of Cummings' modernist literary context as the primary shaping force for his literary aesthetic and we resist any simply reductive explanation of his literary style as a function of dyslexia. However, dyslexia may be one factor that contributes to his unique style.","- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: Dyslexia is discussed from a scientific and genetic perspective, focusing on its traits, susceptibility loci, and linkage to specific regions on a chromosome. It is described as a reading disability, which is characterized by difficulties with phonological processing, spelling, and rapid naming, even in the absence of general intelligence issues or educational opportunities.
- Text B: Dyslexia in this text is approached from a biographical and literary perspective, suggesting that the poet E.E. Cummings may have been dyslexic. The discussion includes observations of his spelling, handwriting, educational history, and struggles in composing analytical prose. Dyslexia is considered as one of the factors that may have contributed to his unique literary style.

Text A treats dyslexia strictly as a genetic and cognitive disability affecting specific skills, primarily from a clinical and research-oriented view. In contrast, Text B explores dyslexia more holistically as a personal trait that might influence creative and literary outputs, suggesting a broader and more nuanced perspective on how dyslexia could affect an individual's abilities beyond traditional academic skills. This marks a significant semantic shift from a clinical disability to a potential contributor to creative literary style."
37,Dyslexia,"Between 3 and 6 per cent of children who are otherwise unimpaired have extreme difficulties producing and understanding spoken language. This disorder is typically labelled specific language impairment. Children diagnosed with specific language impairment often have accompanying reading difficulties (dyslexia), but not all children with reading difficulties have specific language impairment. Some researchers claim that language impairment arises from failures specific to language or cognitive processing. Others hold that language impairment results from a more elemental problem that makes affected children unable to hear the acoustic distinctions among successive brief sounds in speech. Here we report the results of psychophysical tests employing simple tones and noises showing that children with specific language impairment have severe auditory perceptual deficits for brief but not long tones in particular sound contexts. Our data support the view that language difficulties result from problems in auditory perception, and provide further information about the nature of these perceptual problems that should contribute to improving the diagnosis and treatment of language impairment and related disorders.","This case is presented to explain that developmental dyslexia and related autistic spectrum disorders have solely pathological origins. There is a general consensus of opinion which supports the phonological theory. However, this largely ignores the biological basis for all aspects of the brain's development and function, and hence, for its dysfunction. A unified explanation must take into account all salient features including cognitive dysfunction, encephalograph (EEG) frequencies, neural networks, physiological systems, autonomic nervous system and the function of the cerebellum. It must explain the significance of the brain waves and neurons and their normally synchronized or coherent function. This article builds upon an earlier article by the authors, which incorporates a review and discussion of the prevailing theories or models for developmental dyslexia. It looks at the issues from a top-down 'systems biology' perspective. It concludes that it may be only the body's biochemistry and, in particular, the onset of pathologies that explain the phenomena which we recognize as developmental dyslexia. Pathologies experienced in the early prepubescent years influence neural development. They influence the speed and coherent transmission of data between the senses and neural centers. It is proposed that this explains the nature and occurrence of what we recognize as developmental dyslexia.","### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: Dyslexia in this context is discussed as a part of specific language impairment, which often accompanies reading difficulties in children who otherwise have normal cognitive functions. The text examines dyslexia in connection with auditory perceptual deficits, suggesting that these language difficulties stem from auditory perception problems.
- Text B: This text views dyslexia from a broader medical and biological perspective, suggesting it's a result of systemic pathologies that affect neural development and the coherent transmission of sensory data to neural centers. It aligns dyslexia with developmental disorders and considers biochemical factors and brain function as foundational contributions to the disorder.

39,Dyslexia,Several double-blind studies of the effects of piracetam in developmental dyslexia are reviewed. There is general agreement among studies that piracetam appears to improve reading performance.,"Both genetic and socio-demographic factors influence the risk for behavioral problems in the developmental age. Genetic studies indicate that shared genetic factors partially contribute to behavioral and learning problems, in particular reading disabilities (RD). For the first time, we explore the conjoint role of DCDC2 gene, an identified RD candidate gene, and socioeconomic status (SES) upon behavioral phenotypes in a general population of Italian children. Two of the most replicated DCDC2 markers [i.e., regulatory element associated with dyslexia 1 (READ1), rs793862] were genotyped in 631 children (boys = 314; girls = 317) aged 11-14 years belonging to a community-based sample.

- **Label:** Unchanged

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used prominently to refer to a specific learning condition characterized by difficulties in reading abilities, which corresponds well to the standard definition of dyslexia. 

In **Text A**, dyslexia is discussed in the context of improving reading performance through a medication (piracetam). Here, dyslexia is clearly identified as a reading disorder, and the text focuses on interventions aimed at improving the reading skills of individuals diagnosed with this condition.

In **Text B**, the focus extends slightly to potential genetic and socio-demographic influences on the risk for behavioral and learning problems related to dyslexia. Specifically, the text explores how certain genetic markers and socioeconomic status interact and influence the manifestation of dyslexia in children. However, the underlying definition and understanding of dyslexia—as a disorder primarily affecting reading abilities—remain consistent.

Therefore, the basic concept and understanding of ""dyslexia"" as a disorder characterized by difficulties in reading remain essentially the same between the two texts, despite Text B incorporating more modern genetic and socio-demographic dimensions into its discussion. Both texts align with the prevalent understanding of dyslexia as a learning disability, thus indicating that there has been no significant semantic drift in the usage of the word ""dyslexia"" between the two time frames represented."
40,Dyslexia,"It has been suggested that deficits in explicit phonological processing are causal in developmental dyslexia. Deficits in such skills have been reported in developmental phonological dyslexia, though not in developmental surface dyslexia. The reading performance of two children with callosal agenesis, who have been previously shown to have impairments on rhyming tasks, are reported. Neither child is dyslexic in the traditional sense, since word reading levels are appropriate for age. However, both children have impaired development of the phonological reading route despite normal lexical skills. The pattern of their reading is therefore comparable to developmental phonological dyslexia. Problems in explicit phonological processing may be causal in the failure to establish an efficient phonological reading route but this is insufficient to create difficulty with word recognition itself. The corpus callosum may be essential for the normal development of a phonological reading route.","Decades of neuroscientific findings have elucidated the highly specialized brain areas involved in reading, especially along the ventral occipitotemporal stream where the critical step of recognizing words occurs. We report on a 14-year-old female with temporary dyslexia after a left ventral occipitotemporal ischemic stroke. Our longitudinal multimodal findings show that the resolution of the reading impairment was associated with heightened activity in the left posterior superior and inferior temporal gyri. Our findings highlight the role of the left inferior temporal gyrus in reading and the importance of perilesional and ipsilateral cortical areas for functional recovery after childhood stroke.","- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: This text discusses the concept of developmental phonological dyslexia in children with callosal agenesis. It emphasizes the connection between explicit phonological processing deficits and reading difficulties, referring specifically to the inability to establish an efficient phonological reading route.
- Text B: Here, dyslexia is discussed in the context of neurological recovery following a left ventral occipitotemporal ischemic stroke. The focus is on the role of specific brain areas involved in the reading process and their importance in functional recovery from dyslexia after a stroke in childhood.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The word ""dyslexia"" has undergone some degree of semantic drift, as observed from its different emphasis and related neurological aspects in each text. In Text A, dyslexia is viewed primarily from a developmental and cognitive perspective, focusing on phonological processing. In Text B, the focus shifts to a more neuroanatomical and recovery-oriented perspective, highlighting the impacts of brain injuries and the specific brain areas involved in overcoming dyslexia. This shift in the viewpoint and understanding, from cognitive processes to an emphasis on neurology and recovery, indicates a significant development in how dyslexia is conceptualized and approached over time."
41,Dyslexia,"This study compares the nature of the reading deficit that was observed in two dyslexic undergraduate students who were severely impaired at reading and spelling compared with normal undergraduates. They both achieved the same (below average) score on the National Adult Reading Test and on the Schonell spelling test. One of them, however, was good at reading and spelling nonwords, had good phonological awareness skills, was better at reading regular than irregular words, and made phonologically accurate reading and spelling errors (i.e. was a surface dyslexic). The other had poor phonological awareness, produced relatively few phonologically accurate spelling errors, and was poor at reading and spelling nonwords (i.e. was a phonological dyslexic). It is particularly noteworthy that such a clear dissociation between surface and phonological forms of developmental dyslexia occurred in two subjects who were closely matched in terms of their overall reading and spelling ability, and also in terms of their memory span and vocabulary. It is argued that this study strengthens the evidence for the existence of qualitatively different types of developmental dyslexia. The findings are also consistent with the view that phonological awareness skills are more closely related to the operation of the phonological rather than the visual reading route.","This study of an adult case examined in detail with eye movement measures the reading speed problem which is characteristic for developmental dyslexia in regular orthographies. A dramatic length effect was found for low frequency words and for pseudowords, but not for high frequency words. However, even for high frequency words it was found that reading times were substantially prolonged although number of fixations did not differ. A neurocognitive assessment revealed no visual deficits (parallel processing, precedence detection, coherent motion detection) but speed impairments for certain verbal and phonological processes. We propose that the reading difficulties are phonological in nature, but these difficulties become manifest as inefficiency and not as inability.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both Text A and Text B discuss ""developmental dyslexia"" in a similar context of educational and cognitive impairment related to reading and spelling skills. Text A highlights the variations in dyslexia (surface and phonological dyslexia) and their manifestation in reading abilities, similarly, Text B attributes prolonged reading times to phonological processing inefficiencies, devoid of visual deficits. Therefore, the term ""dyslexia"" in both texts pertains to challenges in reading and spelling based on neurological and phonological aspects. Consequently, there has been no significant shift in the meaning or context of how ""dyslexia"" is used over time between the two texts."
42,Dyslexia,"This study of adults with self-reported learning disabilities (SRLD) in Slovenia is part of a larger secondary analysis of the data from the International Literacy Survey project (IALS). The purpose of the study was to examine the characteristics of 79 (2.68%) individuals who reported experiencing learning disabilities and compare them to the general population on a variety of indicators of educational background, employment status, and reading and writing activities at work and at home. The proficiency scores of the SRLD individuals were lower in all three literacy domains (prose, document and quantitative literacy). In prose literacy 77.9% of SRLD adults performed at Level 1 and only 7.8% reached the level necessary for a modern technological society. Experiencing learning disabilities was not related to gender or age, however, results showed significant differences between the levels achieved by older and younger people with SRLD. In SRLD groups aged 40 years and above, no one achieved more than the second level of literacy in any domain. Learning disabilities were reported more frequently in rural areas. SRLD groups achieve significantly lower educational attainment, and lower employment status, with a preference for manual labour or craft. These findings are of critical importance. SRLD people report that poorer literacy skills are an obstacle to their progression in employment. In the Slovene sample, the SRLD group stands out for low scores in quantitative literacy. Results show that they are less active, pick up information only auditorily or in short written form. They need more frequent help from relatives in literacy activities. Interpretation of the IALS data on SRLD presents many problems. These include amongst others, problems in terminology, different background factors, and the validity of self-report measures. However, the study also raises many interesting challenges for future research and policy. Increasing the availability of support, assistance and counselling for adolescents and adults with learning disabilities remains a very important goal for dyslexia and LD policies in Slovenia.","In recent studies phonological deficits in dyslexia are related to a deficit in the synchronization of neural oscillations to the dynamics of the speech envelope. The temporal features of both amplitude modulations and rise times characterize the speech envelope. Previous studies uncovered the inefficiency of the dyslexic brain to follow different amplitude modulations in speech. However, it remains to be investigated how the envelope's rise time mediates this neural processing. In this study we examined neural synchronization in students with and without dyslexia using auditory steady-state responses at theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma range oscillations (i.e., 4, 10, 20 and 40 Hz) to stimuli with different envelope rise times. Our results revealed reduced neural synchronization in the alpha, beta and low-gamma frequency ranges in dyslexia. Moreover, atypical neural synchronization was modulated by rise time for alpha and beta oscillations, showing that deficits found at 10 and 20 Hz were only evident when the envelope's rise time was significantly shortened. This impaired tracking of rise time cues may very well lead to the speech and phonological processing difficulties observed in dyslexia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" is consistently used to describe a condition affecting learning abilities, particularly related to reading and processing speech sounds. Text A focuses more broadly on the impact of dyslexia on general literacy, educational achievement, and the social implications. It mentions learning disabilities broadly, associating them with diminished literacy performance across different domains. Text B dives into specific cognitive and neurological aspects of dyslexia, particularly its relationship with neural synchronization to speech sounds. Although Text B employs a more detailed, scientific approach to viewing dyslexia, it fundamentally aligns with Text A's interpretation that dyslexia primarily affects the handling of linguistic and phonological information. The semantic core concerning dyslexia as a learning disability associated with reading and phonological processing remains unchanged between the texts, despite differing granularities and focal points in their discussions."
43,Dyslexia,"Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies of developmental dyslexia reveals dysfunction at posterior brain regions centered in and around the angular gyrus in the left hemisphere. We examined functional connectivity (covariance) between the angular gyrus and related occipital and temporal lobe sites, across a series of print tasks that systematically varied demands on phonological assembly. Results indicate that for dyslexic readers a disruption in functional connectivity in the language-dominant left hemisphere is confined to those tasks that make explicit demands on assembly. In contrast, on print tasks that do not require phonological assembly, functional connectivity is strong for both dyslexic and nonimpaired readers. The findings support the view that neurobiological anomalies in developmental dyslexia are largely confined to the phonological-processing domain. In addition, the findings suggest that right-hemisphere posterior regions serve a compensatory role in mediating phonological performance in dyslexic readers.","A growing body of neuroimaging evidence shows that white matter can change as a result of experience and structured learning. Although the majority of previous work has used diffusion MRI to characterize such changes in white matter, diffusion metrics offer limited biological specificity about which microstructural features may be driving white matter plasticity. Recent advances in myelin-specific MRI techniques offer a promising opportunity to assess the specific contribution of myelin in learning-related plasticity. Here we describe the application of such an approach to examine structural plasticity during an early intervention in preliterate children at risk for dyslexia. To this end, myelin water imaging data were collected before and after a 12-week period in (1) at-risk children following early literacy training (n = 13-24), (2) at-risk children engaging with other non-literacy games (n = 10-17) and (3) children without a risk receiving no training (n = 11-22). Before the training, regional risk-related differences were identified, showing higher myelin water fraction (MWF) in right dorsal white matter in at-risk children compared to the typical control group. Concerning intervention-specific effects, our results revealed an increase across left-hemispheric and right ventral MWF over the course of training in the at-risk children receiving early literacy training, but not in the at-risk active control group or the no-risk typical control group. Overall, our results provide support for the use of myelin water imaging as a sensitive tool to investigate white matter and offer a first indication of myelin plasticity in young children at the onset of literacy acquisition.","- Target word: Dyslexia

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the use of the word ""dyslexia"" consistently refers to a neurobiological condition related to difficulties in reading and phonological processing. Text A presents findings about functional connectivity issues in dyslexic readers, particularly related to phonological assembly tasks, reflecting a biological and functional understanding of dyslexia. Text B, while discussing more advanced neuroimaging techniques and interventions, still centers on dyslexia as a neurodevelopmental condition that has to do with brain structures (specifically myelin) and the effects of literacy training. Hence, the core concept and usage of ""dyslexia"" in terms of its relation to brain function, reading, and phonological impairment has remained largely consistent."
44,Dyslexia,"Contrary to the current assumption that there are no specific correlates of dyslexia in the standard clinical EEG, we have often noted a spontaneous ""intermittent left parietal alpha desynchronization"" (ILPAD) when visually evaluating the standard EEGs of children with delayed speech and language development and/or dyslexia. Visual evaluations of EEGs, as well as computer-assisted frequency analysis of three pairs of matched groups (healthy and hyperkinetic children with vs. without relatively ""low levels"" of verbal performance, as well as children with other child psychiatric disorders with vs. without dyslexia), revealed that healthy children did not display the ILPAD phenomenon. It was seen neither in healthy children with a homogeneous performance profile (""high level"" of verbal performance) nor in those with a relatively ""low level"" of verbal performance. However, the ILPAD phenomenon was evident mainly in children with psychiatric disorders who suffered from dyslexia. Its intermittent occurrence prevented its detection by means of the usual computer-supported analyses of EEG power spectra. Nevertheless, auditory cognitive loading was accompanied by a decrease in alpha power in both healthy and hyperkinetic children with ""high"" or ""low"" levels of verbal performance. In a further group of 8-year-old children with dyslexia, but otherwise healthy, the ILPAD phenomenon was also observed if their CNS maturation as reflected in the EEG was normal for their age. These results seemed to indicate at least a deficit-specificity of the ILPAD phenomenon, which is interpreted as an electrophysiological correlate of a ""brain-electrical developmental deviation"" with regard to the ""functions of communication"": speech, language, reading and spelling.","We report the case of ET, a 7-year-old child with a severe developmental letter-processing impairment. Detailed assessment revealed multiple impairments of the letter-processing system affecting abstract visual letter representation, semantics, and connections between the phonological processing modules and the orthographic buffer. Treatment methods focused on letter sounding through development of abstract visual representation and semantic representation of letters. Treatment resulted in dramatic and enduring improvements in cross-case matching, letter/number categorization, and letter sounding. Cognitive neuropsychological reading research has largely focused on word processing, with a relative neglect of single-letter processing. The current study investigated letter processing in greater detail than has been usual and outlines a broad theoretical framework for letter processing. ET's assessment and treatment data are used to support and question predictions from the framework. A number of theoretical implications are discussed with reference to ET's data and that of other reported cases of impaired single-letter processing. Finally, the paucity of investigation of letter processing in children is highlighted, particularly with regard to integrity of abstract letter representation in developmental dyslexia.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: In Text A, dyslexia is discussed in relation to its electrophysiological correlates, specifically an ""intermittent left parietal alpha desynchronization"" (ILPAD) detected in EEGs. The dyslexia is associated with psychiatric disorders and delayed speech and language development. The focus is largely on the clinical and neurological signs of dyslexia as seen in EEG patterns.
- Text B: Text B addresses dyslexia from a cognitive neuropsychological perspective, specifically focusing on a severe developmental letter-processing impairment in a child. The text delves into the subtleties of dyslexia through specific impairments like visual representation, semantics, and phonological connections affecting reading and spelling. The emphasis is on detailed assessment and treatment of letter processing components, indicating a more advanced and specialized understanding of dyslexia's manifestations.
- Label: Changed
- Reason: The use and context of the term ""dyslexia"" in the two texts indicate a broadening framework over time. Initially approached from a general clinical EEG perspective (Text A), the focus has transitioned to a more nuanced treatment of letters and cognitive processing (Text B). This reflects a shift from a broader neurological perspective to a specialized cognitive and educational framework in understanding and addressing dyslexia, signifying a semantic expansion and change in connotation of the condition."
45,Dyslexia,"The current research examined performance of good and poor readers of Thai on two tasks that assess sensitivity to dynamic visual displays. Readers of Thai, a complex alphabetic script that nonetheless has a regular orthography, were chosen in order to contrast patterns of performance with readers of Korean Hangul (a similarly regular language but one that has a simple visual format, see ). Thai poor readers were less sensitive than good readers on the two measures of dynamic visual processing; they had higher thresholds for detecting coherent movement and required longer ISIs to report group movement in the Ternus task. These results differ from those for poor readers of Korean Hangul that found no relationship between visual processing thresholds and reading skill. This contrast suggests that the expression of visual processing problems in dyslexia is mediated by the format properties of the writing system and points to the need to consider such factors in formulating brain-behavior relationships.","We explore the influence of a secondary cognitive task on concurrent postural control in dyslexic children. Seventeen children with dyslexia (DYS) were compared with thirteen non-dyslexic children (NDYS). Postural control was recorded in Standard Romberg (SR) and Tandem Romberg (TR) conditions while children, in separate sessions, have to fixate on a target and name simple objects appearing consecutively on a computer screen. The surface, the length and the mean speed of the center of pressure were analyzed; the percentage of correct responses to the cognitive task was also measured. DYS are significantly more unstable than NDYS. The secondary cognitive task significantly decreases the postural stability in DYS only. For both children postural performances in the TR condition is significantly worse than in the SR condition. The percentage of wrong responses to the cognitive task is significantly higher in DYS. Postural instability observed in DYS supports the hypothesis that there is a deficit of automatic integration of visual information and postural control in these children. This result is in line with the U-shaped non linear model showing that a secondary task performed during a postural task leads to an impaired postural stability probably due to focus attention on the cognitive task. ","### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The focus is on differences in visual processing abilities between good and poor readers of Thai, investigating how dyslexia impacts sensitivity to dynamic visual displays, influenced by the format properties of the writing system.
- Text B: Research centers on the impact of dyslexia on postural control while performing a secondary cognitive task, highlighting how children with dyslexia differ significantly in stability and response accuracy compared to non-dyslexic children.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and B, ""dyslexia"" refers to a specific learning impairment affecting certain cognitive and perceptual tasks. In Text A, it's about how dyslexia affects visual processing related to reading, and in Text B, it's about how dyslexia impacts postural control during cognitive multitasking. The core concept of dyslexia as a cognitive impairment remains consistent, focusing on its effects in different capacities, hence no significant change in its semantic usage is observed."
46,Dyslexia,"Chromosome-specific DNA markers provide a powerful approach for studying complex problems in human genetics and offer an opportunity to begin understanding the human genome at the molecular level. The approach described here for isolating and characterizing DNA markers specific to human chromosome 15 involved construction of a partial chromosome-15 phage library from a human/Chinese hamster cell hybrid with a single human chromosome 15. Restriction fragments that identified unique- and low-copy loci on chromosome 15 were isolated from the phage inserts. These fragments were regionally mapped to the chromosome by three methods, including Southern analysis with a mapping panel of cell hybrids, in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, and quantitative hybridization or dosage analysis. A total of 42 restriction fragments of unique- and low-copy sequences were identified in 14 phage. The majority of the fragments that have been characterized so far exhibited the hybridization pattern of a unique locus on chromosome 15. Regional mapping assigned these markers to specific locations on chromosome 15, including q24-25, q21-23, q13-14, q11-12, and q11. RFLP analysis revealed that several markers displayed polymorphisms at frequencies useful for genetic linkage analysis. The markers mapped to the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 are particularly valuable for the molecular analysis of Prader-Willi syndrome, which maps to this region. Polymorphic markers in this region may also be useful for definitively establishing linkage with one form of dyslexia. DNA probes in this chromosomal region should facilitate molecular structural analysis for elucidation of the nature of instability in this region, which is frequently associated with chromosomal aberrations.","Visual perception is often not homogenous across the visual field and can vary depending on situational demands. The reasons behind this inhomogeneity are not clear. Here we show that directing attention that is consistent with a western reading habit from left to right, results in a ~32% higher sensitivity to detect transient visual events in the right hemifield. This right visual field advantage was largely reduced in individuals with reading difficulties from developmental dyslexia. Similarly, visual detection became more symmetric in skilled readers, when attention was guided opposite to the reading pattern. Taken together, these findings highlight a higher sensitivity in the right visual field for detecting the onset of sudden visual events that is well accounted for by left hemisphere dominated reading habit.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" maintains its core meaning related to reading and cognitive processing difficulties, specifically in the context of learning and development. Text A discusses ""dyslexia"" in relation to genetic studies and its linkage on chromosome 15, suggesting a basis in biological and genetic factors affecting reading skills. Text B focuses on the neurocognitive impact of dyslexia, showing how it affects attention and visual event detection in the context of reading. Despite the different aspects and approaches (genetic in Text A versus neurocognitive in Text B), the underlying meaning of the word ""dyslexia"" as a learning disorder centered around reading remains consistent. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the word ""dyslexia"" between the two time periods of the texts."
47,Dyslexia,"The evolving neuropathology of primarily undamaged cortical regions adjacent to the injured site has been studied in 36 infants who survived a variety of perinatally acquired encephalopathies (microgyrias, ulegyrias, multicystic encephalopathies, porencephalies, and hydranencephalies) and later died of unrelated causes. Their survival times range from hours, days, weeks, or months, to several years. Ten of these children developed epilepsy, 2 developed cerebral palsy, and several were neurologically and mentally impaired. In all cases studied, the undamaged cortex adjacent to the injured site survives, retains its intrinsic vasculature, and is capable of continuing differentiation. However, its postinjury development is characterized by progressive alterations compatible with acquired cortical dysplasia that affects the structural and functional differentiation of its neurons, synaptic profiles, fiber distribution, glial elements, and vasculature. The synaptic profiles of many neurons are transformed by an increased number of intrinsic loci that replace extrinsic ones vacated by the destruction of afferent fibers. The intrinsic fibers of layer I and some Cajal-Retzius cells survive even in severe lesions and may be capable of interconnecting cortical regions that have lost other type of connections. Some intrinsic neurons undergo postinjury structural and functional hypertrophy, acquire new morphologic and functional features, and achieve a large size (meganeurons). Probably, these meganeurons acquire their structural and functional hypertrophy by partial endomitotic DNA and/or RNA reduplication (polyploidy). These postinjury alterations are not static but ongoing processes that continue to affect the structural and functional differentiation of the still developing cortex and may eventually influence the neurologic and cognitive maturation of affected children. This study proposes that, in acquired encephalopathies, the progressive postinjury reorganization of the undamaged cortex and its consequences (acquired cortical dysplasia), rather than the original lesion, represent the main underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of ensuing neurological sequelae, such as, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, dyslexia, cognitive impairment, and/or poor school performance.","This study focused on predicting dyslexia in children ahead of formal literacy training. Because dyslexia is a constitutional impairment, risk factors should be seen in preschool. It was hypothesized that data gathered at age 5 using questions targeting the dyslexia endophenotype should be reliable and valid predictors of dyslexia at age 11. A questionnaire was given to caretakers of 120 5-year-old children, and a risk index score was calculated based on questions regarding health, laterality, motor skills, language, special needs education and heredity. An at-risk group (n = 25) and matched controls (n = 24) were followed until age 11, when a similar questionnaire and literacy tests were administered to the children who participated in the follow-up study (22 at risk and 20 control). Half of the at-risk children and two of the control children at age 5 were identified as having dyslexia at age 11 (8 girls and 5 boys). It is concluded that it is possible to identify children at the age of 5 who will have dyslexia at the age of 11 through a questionnaire approach.","### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The excerpt largely describes the neuroanatomical and pathological findings in children who have experienced various encephalopathies that influenced their cognitive and neurological development, including dyslexia. Dyslexia, in this context, is portrayed as a potential outcome of brain injury and neurological issues related to cerebral disruptions.
- Text B: This text focuses on early identification of dyslexia through predictive measures taken before formal schooling begins. It views dyslexia as a constitutional or intrinsic impairment detectable through indicators not necessarily linked to brain injury, but rather through a variety of developmental signs.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The usage and conceptualization of ""dyslexia"" have shifted from predominantly being seen as a potential consequence of neurological damage or brain diseases (as implied in Text A) to being recognized as a distinct developmental and constitutional disorder that can be predicted early in the child's development (as described in Text B). The focus has moved from post-damage diagnosis to early, preventive identification and management, demonstrating a substantial expansion in our understanding of what dyslexia encompasses, shifting from a mere symptom of damage to a standalone condition identifiable through genetic, developmental, and behavioral signs."
48,Dyslexia,"This study investigated the gradient of visual attention in 21 children, 11 children with specific reading disorder (SRD) or dyslexia and 10 children with normal reading skills. We recorded reaction times (RTs) at the onset of a small point along the horizontal axis in the two visual fields. In 70% of the cases the target appeared inside a circle acting as focusing cue and in 30% of the cases it appeared outside, allowing us to study the distribution of attentional resources outside the selected area. Normally reading children showed a normal symmetric distribution of attention. Indeed, RTs were directly proportional to the eccentricity of the target, and no visual field effect was observable. In contrast, children with SRD showed an anomalous and asymmetric distribution. The effect of the target eccentricity influenced RTs only when the stimulus was projected in the left visual field, whereas no effect was observable when the stimulus was projected in the right visual field. Findings allowed us to discuss the relation between this anomalous spatial distribution of visual attentional resources and dyslexia. To interpret the visual perceptual difficulties of children with SRD the hypothesis was made of a selective disorder of spatial attention (left inattention and right over-distractibility) related to a right parietal cortex dysfunction.","Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder whose manifestations include visuospatial impairment, provides a unique model to link genetically determined loss of neural cell populations at different levels of the nervous system with neural circuits and visual behavior. Given that several of the genes deleted in WBS are also involved in eye development and the differentiation of retinal layers, we examined the retinal phenotype in WBS patients and its functional relation to global motion perception. We discovered a low-level visual phenotype characterized by decreased retinal thickness, abnormal optic disk concavity, and impaired visual responses in WBS patients compared with age-matched controls by using electrophysiology, confocal and coherence in vivo imaging with cellular resolution, and psychophysics. These mechanisms of impairment are related to the magnocellular pathway, which is involved in the detection of temporal changes in the visual scene. Low-level magnocellular performance did not predict high-level deficits in the integration of motion and 3D information at higher levels, thereby demonstrating independent mechanisms of dysfunction in WBS that will require remediation strategies different from those used in other visuospatial disorders. These findings challenge neurodevelopmental theories that explain cortical deficits based on low-level magnocellular impairment, such as regarding dyslexia.","### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: This study investigated the gradient of visual attention in children with specific reading disorder (SRD) or dyslexia, highlighting an anomalous asymmetric distribution of attentional resources linked to dyslexia, associated with potential neurological dysfunction.
- Text B: The text discusses Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) and primarily focuses on retinal phenotypes and their relation to magnocellular pathway dysfunction. Dyslexia is briefly mentioned in the context of comparing WBS to other visuospatial disorders, suggesting that traditional theories linking magnocellular impairment to dyslexia might not be universally applicable.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both Text A and Text B discuss dyslexia in relation to neurological and perceptual functions, albeit from different angles. Text A directly analyzes dyslexia with attentional anomalies, while Text B mentions it briefly in the context of broader neurodevelopmental theories. Despite the different focus and detail of discussions, the underlying concept of dyslexia as related to specific neurological impairments remains consistent. Both texts support the notion that dyslexia involves complex brain function issues, keeping the core definition and understanding of dyslexia unchanged across the years represented by these texts."
49,Dyslexia,"Difficulties of lexical retrieval are a complex syndrome which is hard to delimit. The syndrome implies an unexpected failure in word identification, access to meaning, pronunciation and spelling. It affects individuals with normal intelligence and interferes significantly with academic achievement and with everyday tasks that involve the ability to read. It is estimated that 4% of school age children in the USA suffer from it, compared to 2% in Spain. The chronic nature of dyslexia and the social and emotional problems that it brings about are of considerable concern to education professionals. In this paper we attempt an exhaustive review of recent studies on this topic. We use this review as a basis to reflect on the repercussions of recent findings for the design of effective assessment tasks and intervention techniques.","Dyslexia is a developmental disorder characterised by extensive difficulties in the acquisition of reading or spelling. Genetic influence is estimated at 50-70%. However, the link between genetic variants and phenotypic deficits is largely unknown. Our aim was to investigate a role of genetic variants of FOXP2, a prominent speech and language gene, in dyslexia using imaging genetics. This technique combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and genetics to investigate relevance of genetic variants on brain activation. To our knowledge, this represents the first usage of fMRI-based imaging genetics in dyslexia. In an initial case/control study (n = 245) for prioritisation of FOXP2 polymorphisms for later use in imaging genetics, nine SNPs were selected. A non-synonymously coding mutation involved in verbal dyspraxia was also investigated. SNP rs12533005 showed nominally significant association with dyslexia (genotype GG odds ratio recessive model = 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.1-3.9), P = 0.016). A correlated SNP was associated with altered expression of FOXP2 in vivo in human hippocampal tissue. Therefore, influence of the rs12533005-G risk variant on brain activity was studied. fMRI revealed a significant main effect for the factor 'genetic risk' in a temporo-parietal area involved in phonological processing as well as a significant interaction effect between the factors 'disorder' and 'genetic risk' in activation of inferior frontal brain areas. Hence, our data may hint at a role of FOXP2 genetic variants in dyslexia-specific brain activation and demonstrate use of imaging genetics in dyslexia research.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
The target word ""Dyslexia"" maintains its fundamental meaning related to difficulties in the acquisition and processing of reading and spelling across both texts from different time periods. Both texts describe dyslexia as a condition that involves challenges with reading and spelling, affecting academic achievement and requiring specific interventions. Text A focuses on the overall nature of dyslexia, its impacts, and educational concerns, while Text B delves deeper into the genetic factors and investigates specific genetic components associated with dyslexia through modern research methods like imaging genetics. Despite the advancement in understanding the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings in Text B, the core definition and the conceptualization of dyslexia as a developmental disorder related to reading and spelling remain consistent. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""Dyslexia"" has not shifted significantly between the two periods."
50,Dyslexia,"This presentation draws together findings from the literature on giftedness, on diversity of talents, on definitions and descriptions of intelligence, on the role of emotion in learning, and on the markers and manifestations of the dyslexias. In many instances, high potential in the three-dimensional realm coexists with difficulty in the two-dimensional symbolic or abstract realm. This seeming paradox deserves exploration so educators, parents, and other concerned adults can recognize and nurture students' talents as well as offer appropriate remedial support.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is consistently used to represent a specific learning difficulty associated with reading and other related skills. Text A discusses dyslexia in the context of the unusual coexistence of high intellectual or creative potential with challenges in symbolic or abstract learning. Text B examines dyslexia among school students, exploring its prevalence and its potential association with obesity and overweight. Although the contexts of the studies are different — one looking at intellectual development and the other examining a potential health linkage — the underlying use of ""dyslexia"" to denote a learning disorder related to reading remains consistent. There is no evidence of a semantic drift in the word's meaning between the texts."
51,Dyslexia,"One of the major risk factors for reading disability is difficulty learning to read words in text in an accurate and fluent manner. This is apparent when a child at risk of dyslexia first starts to attempt to read. Dyslexic children struggle to grasp and automate the alphabetic principle (ie, they cannot ""sound out"" words or use phonemic decoding strategies) and therefore have difficulty deciphering unfamiliar words that they have not encountered before. Even though many of these words are part of the child's oral vocabulary, the child cannot recognize them in printed form. As a result, reading can be extremely laborious and time-consuming, fraught with errors, and altogether an unrewarding, aversive experience. To be an efficient reader, one must be able to rapidly and effortlessly recognize many words by sight, and for a child to acquire this facility requires multiple exposures to these words. The difficulty that dyslexic children have in developing reliable and efficient phonemic decoding ability makes the acquisition of a lexicon of sight words a much slower process than it is for the average reader. Several other factors can affect a child's ability to read, which are reviewed herein. However, early recognition and treatment of deficient phonologic awareness are an extremely important step in the prevention of a reading problem in the child who is at risk of dyslexia.","This study aimed to verify whether children with dyslexia have difficulties in executive functions (shifting, working memory, inhibition).","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" refers to a specific learning difficulty affecting the ability to read, write, and spell fluently and accurately, often involving challenges with phonemic decoding and other language-based skills. In Text A, dyslexia is described mainly in terms of challenges in reading fluency and decoding unfamiliar words, emphasizing difficulties in developing phonemic awareness. Text B focuses on examining whether children with dyslexia also have difficulties with executive functions, which could include components like working memory and inhibition, but still under the broader umbrella of cognitive challenges associated with dyslexia. Both texts align in depicting dyslexia as a condition that primarily affects reading and related cognitive skills, maintaining the fundamental concept of dyslexia as a learning disability with a consistent thematic focus on its impact on essential academic and cognitive functions. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage and meaning of ""dyslexia"" between the two texts."
52,Dyslexia,"Successful behavioral genetic studies require precise definition of a homogenous phenotype. This study searched for anatomical markers that might restrict variability in the reading disability phenotype. The subjects were 15 college students (8 male/7 female) diagnosed with a reading disability (RD) and 15 controls (8 males/7 females). All subjects completed a cognitive and reading battery. Only 11 of the RD subjects had a phonological deficit [phonological dyslexia (PD): pseudo word decoding scores < 90 (27th percentile)]. Thirteen RD (9 PD) and 15 controls received a volumetric MRI scan. Four anatomical measures differentiated the PD group from the remainder of the subjects: (i) marked rightward cerebral asymmetry, (ii) marked leftward asymmetry of the anterior lobe of the cerebellum, (ii) combined leftward asymmetry of the planum and posterior ascending ramus of the sylvian fissure, and (iv) a large duplication of Heschl's gyrus on the left. When these four measures were normalized and summed, the resulting variable predicted short- and long-term phonological memory. By contrast, oral and written comprehension skills were predicted by a different anatomical variable: low cerebral volume. These findings provide neurobiological support for an RD phenotype characterized by phonological deficits in the presence of normal or superior comprehension. The study of individual variation in cortical structure may provide a useful link between genotype and behavior.","The attentional blink (AB) refers to a decrease in accuracy that occurs when participants are required to detect the second of two rapidly sequential targets displayed randomly in a stream of distracters. Dyslexic individuals have been shown to exhibit a prolonged AB in the visual modality, interpreted as evidence of sluggish attentional shifting (SAS). However, the amodal SAS theory predicts that the disorder should further extend to the auditory modality, then resulting in a phonological disorder as typically found in developmental dyslexia. Otherwise, it has been demonstrated that a visual attention (VA) span deficit contributes to the poor reading outcome of dyslexic individuals, independently of their phonological skills. The present study assesses the amodality assumption of the SAS theory together with questioning its relation with the VA span deficit. For this purpose, visual and auditory ABs were explored in a well compensated young adult, LL, who exhibits a pure phonological dyslexia characterised by poor pseudo-word processing and poor phonological skills but preserved VA span. The investigation revealed two different kinds of deficits in LL. Her AB was prolonged and marginally deeper in the visual modality whereas a primarily deeper in amplitude and a subtle prolonged AB was found in the auditory modality. The atypical performance patterns of LL in both modalities suggest that her perceptual attention disorder is amodal as predicted by the SAS theory. This amodal disorder was here reported in a dyslexic participant with a phonological disorder, well in accordance with the hypothesis that sluggish auditory attention shifting contributes to difficulties in phoneme awareness and literacy acquisition. Furthermore, prolonged VA blink was observed in the absence of VA span disorder, thus suggesting that visual attentional shifting and VA span might be distinct mechanisms, contributing independently to reading acquisition and developmental dyslexia.","- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:**
  Analyzing the two provided texts, the target word ""dyslexia"" remains centered around the broad concept of a learning disorder characterized by difficulties in reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. 

  In Text A, ""dyslexia"" is discussed in the context of phonological deficits—a specific aspect or subtype of dyslexia where individuals struggle primarily with decoding phonetic sounds, which is well-aligned with the traditional definition of dyslexia centered on difficulties with reading processes.

  Text B continues to discuss ""dyslexia"" with an emphasis on a specific facet of the disorder—phonological dyslexia—while also addressing related perceptual and attention-related difficulties that impact reading, such as visual attention (VA) span and attentional shifting. The use of the term still fundamentally relates to the difficulties in reading and processing language, consistent with the conventional understanding of dyslexia.

  Overall, despite delving into more specialized aspects and related cognitive deficits in more recent research, the core meaning of ""dyslexia"" as a learning disability primarily affecting the ability to read and process language has not changed significantly between the two texts."
53,Dyslexia,"Several neuropsychological deficits have been reported as characteristic of the cognitive profile of dyslexic children. Phonological and visual processing are often impaired as well as auditory processing, attention and information processing speed. We investigated whether implicit learning, is impaired in dyslexic children and adolescents. Tests of implicit and declarative learning were administered to 18 clinically defined dyslexics and 18 similar age controls. Dyslexics showed a reduced learning rate in the implicit but not in the declarative task, suggesting a specific deficit of implicit learning. Although alternative hypothesis cannot be ruled out, considering that implicit learning is a cognitive function primarily processed by the cerebellum and that recent neurological and physiological data suggest a cerebellar dysfunction in dyslexia, the present results suggest an impairment of cerebellar system in reading disabilities.","In this study of the project DyAdd (Adult Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder in Finland), classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC) was investigated in both delay and trace paradigms in adults (18-55 years) with dyslexia (n = 37), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 21), their comorbid combination (n = 8), and healthy controls (n = 35). In addition, the profiles of three participants with a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar disease were assessed (episodic ataxia type 2, EA-2). We found that participants with dyslexia were overall slower learners than controls in eyeblink conditioning. Further, they were the only group that had a reduced number of CRs in mediotemporal-dependent trace paradigm compared to the more cerebellum-dependent delay paradigm. Second, ADHD was found to be related to larger CR amplitude. Third, those with a comorbid condition learned faster and manifested CRs that were not well timed. Fourth, the cerebellar patients showed nearly no conditioning at all. Correlations between EBC and various neuropsychological domains (phonological processing, reading, spelling, arithmetic, executive functions, attention, and fine motor control) over all participants resulted in significant relations only for the delay paradigm: Increased amount of reading errors related with later peak latency and increased amount of self-corrections in fine motor control related with larger response magnitude. Within those who conditioned, relations emerged only for the trace paradigm: better spelling was related to larger response magnitude. These results do not lend support to the cerebellar hypothesis of dyslexia. On the contrary, dyslexia in its pure form seems to be related to a relative dysfunction of a larger hippocampal-cerebellar network. Further, larger responses in the ADHD group are suggested to result from their lowered responding threshold.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The description of dyslexia highlights neuropsychological deficits which are typical in dyslexic individuals, including difficulties in phonological, visual, auditory processing, attention, and information processing speed. The focus is on identifying specific cognitive functions that are impaired, such as implicit learning, and suggests a possible connection to cerebellar dysfunction.
- Text B: This text elaborates on a detailed study involving adults with dyslexia, alongside those with ADHD and a comorbid combination, comparing their responses in eyeblink conditioning tasks. The findings indicate complications in learning patterns, especially differences between cerebellum-dependent and mediotemporal-dependent tasks, and suggest an interaction between dyslexia and broader neurological networks, rather than attributing it solely to cerebellar dysfunction.

- Label: **Changed**
- Reason: The conceptualization of dyslexia changes from being primarily viewed as linked to cerebellar dysfunction and certain cognitive processing deficits in Text A, to being understood as part of a broader neurological network involving both the cerebellum and hippocampus in Text B. The nuanced understanding in Text B indicates an evolving perspective on the neurological underpinnings and interrelations with other conditions like ADHD, which marks a broadening of the contextual and causal understanding of dyslexia over time."
54,Dyslexia,Experts disagree on the etiology and definition of dyslexia. Neurological research is ongoing but is not yet conclusive. Specific educational techniques for diagnosis and remediation are available.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the use of the word ""dyslexia"" is consistent and refers to a specific learning disorder characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling abilities. Text A focuses on the challenges, ongoing research, and the role of different professionals in dealing with dyslexia, indicating an educational and neurological perspective. Text B emphasizes the disparity in attention and resources given to dyslexia between developed and developing countries but still aligns with the fundamental interpretation of dyslexia as a learning disorder. Thus, there is no significant shift in the meaning of the word ""dyslexia"" between the texts, indicating that the semantic use of the word remains unchanged."
55,Dyslexia,"Recent research findings pointing to an anatomical anomaly in the left hemisphere of dyslexics supports the conjecture that dyslexia involves a central anomaly in structural linguistic capacity. Two preliminary studies were carried out to test this conjecture. One study employed the techniques of grammatical research and the other was a reaction time study. Each study provided distinct evidence of a linguistic anomaly. The grammatical study suggested an anomaly when the assignment of referential relations among nominal elements is restricted on the basis of sentence structure, and the reaction time study provided evidence of an anomaly in the exploitation of grammatical markers. ","We studied the linguistic profile and neurolinguistic organization of a 14-year-old adolescent (EB) who underwent a left hemispherectomy at the age of 2.5 years. After initial aphasia, his language skills recovered within 2 years, with the exception of some word finding problems. Over the years, the neuropsychological assessments showed that EB's language was near-to-normal, with the exception of lexical competence, which lagged slightly behind for both auditory and written language. Moreover, EB's accuracy and speed in both reading and writing words and non-words were within the normal range, whereas difficulties emerged in reading loan words and in tasks with homophones. EB's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns for several linguistic and metalinguistic tasks were similar to those observed in the dominant hemisphere of controls, suggesting that his language network conforms to a left-like linguistic neural blueprint. However, a stronger frontal recruitment suggests that linguistic tasks are more demanding for him. Finally, no specific reading activation was found in EB's occipitotemporal region, a finding consistent with the surface dyslexia-like behavioral pattern of the patient. While a lone right hemisphere may not be sufficient to guarantee full blown linguistic competences after early hemispherectomy, EB's behavioral and fMRI patterns suggest that his lone right hemisphere followed a left-like blueprint of the linguistic network.","###Answer:

- Reason: The term ""dyslexia"" in both texts refers to a condition characterized by difficulties related to language processing or structural linguistic anomalies often linked with neurological brain function. Text A discusses dyslexia primarily from a research and phenomenological perspective concerning grammatical anomalies, while Text B focuses on a case study examining the neurolinguistic implications of dyslexia. Despite different focuses, the underlying definition and concept of dyslexia as a disorder affecting the processing of linguistic and written language remains consistent in both texts. No significant semantic drift in the term ""dyslexia"" is evident between the two periods.
"
56,Dyslexia,"Deficits in phonological skills appear to be at the heart of reading disability; however, the nature of this impairment is not yet known. The hypothesis that dyslexic subjects are impaired in auditory frequency discrimination was tested by using an attention-independent auditory brain potential, termed mismatch negativity (MMN) while subjects performed a visual distractor task. In separate blocks, MMN responses to graded changes in tone frequency or tone duration were recorded in 10 dyslexic and matched control subjects. MMN potentials to changes in tone frequency but not to changes in tone duration were abnormal in dyslexic subjects. This physiological deficit was corroborated by a similarly specific impairment in discriminating tone frequency, but not tone duration, which was assessed separately. Furthermore, the pitch discrimination and MMN deficit was correlated with the degree of impairment in phonological skills, as reflected in reading errors of regular words and nonwords. It is possible that in dyslexia a persistent sensory deficit in monitoring the frequency of incoming sound may impair the feedback control necessary for the normal development of phonological skills.","This paper reports the case of a dyslexic boy (L.A.) whose impaired reading of Filipino is consistent with developmental surface dyslexia. Filipino has a transparent alphabetic orthography with stress typically falling on the penultimate syllable of multisyllabic words. However, exceptions to the typical stress pattern are not marked in the Filipino orthography. L.A. read words with typical stress patterns as accurately as controls, but made many more stress errors than controls when reading Filipino words with atypical stress. He regularized the pronunciation of many of these words by incorrectly placing the stress on the penultimate syllable. Since he also read nonwords as accurately and quickly as controls and performed well on tests of phonological awareness, L.A. appears to present a clear case of developmental surface dyslexia in a transparent orthography. ","- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**:
  - In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used to describe a specific reading disability associated with phonological impairments. Text A focuses on auditory discrimination deficits in dyslexic subjects and correlates these deficits with reading and phonological impairments, indicating an underlying sensory issue affecting phonological skill development. Text B discusses a case of developmental surface dyslexia in a Filipino-speaking boy, detailing how his dyslexia manifests in incorrect stress placement when reading words with atypical stress patterns in his native language, despite average performances in phonological awareness and nonword reading tasks. Both texts illustrate the application of the term ""dyslexia"" in the context of a reading and phonological processing disorder, consistent across the described cases and research settings.
  - This consistent usage suggests that the fundamental understanding and application of the term ""dyslexia"" as a specific learning disability related to reading and phonological processing has not changed significantly between the periods covered by the two texts. Consequently, the term ""dyslexia"" has retained its core meaning related to reading disabilities, showing no notable semantic drift in the contexts provided."
57,Dyslexia,"The ICD-10 calls for the use of tables that account for the correlation between intelligence and spelling or reading, respectively (regression model) in the diagnosis of dyslexia. In this paper we discuss the consequences that arise from this recommendation with respect to the interpretation of psychometric tests. In addition, a table is presented that contains the data required to make diagnostic decisions based on the regression model. Furthermore, an expected prevalence rate was calculated using randomized computer data.","A group of 39 persons (20 male and 19 female, 11.0 to 32.5 yr.) with developmental dyslexia and 42 controls (21 male and 21 female, 11.2 to 32.3 years) were compared on computerized tests of sight word reading, nonword decoding, and spelling recognition. The subjects with developmental dyslexia performed significantly slower and less accurately than controls on all tasks. Further, the effect size of the group differences was larger for the older group. Within-group analyses showed a significant difference by age group on accuracy. Only the control group showed a significant age difference between groups on response time. Mean accuracy and response times for the reading-disabled subjects resembled shifted versions of the control group means. These results agree with previous reports that phonological deficits persist for reading-disabled adults and suggest a test of whether the discrepancy between reading-disabled and typically achieving readers may actually increase across age groups.","###Label:

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used to describe a condition related to difficulties with reading, spelling, and related activities, associated with cognitive processing rather than a physical or visual impairment. Text A discusses the diagnostic considerations and methods involving psychometric tests for dyslexia, focusing on the correlation between intelligence and reading or spelling abilities, while Text B presents a study comparing dyslexic individuals with controls in tasks like word reading, nonword decoding, and spelling. Both texts maintain the educational and psychological context surrounding the diagnosis and analysis of dyslexia, suggesting that the meaning of the word has remained consistent across the two time periods. The semantic core of dyslexia as a learning disability focused on literacy skills is unchanged, with both contexts discussing its impact on reading and related cognitive tasks."
58,Dyslexia,"The planum temporale is clearly involved in language processing, for it serves as the auditory association cortex. Research has consistently demonstrated that 60 to 70% of the population has leftward asymmetry of the planum temporale. Research has also suggested that dyslexic individuals tend to have either rightward asymmetry or symmetrical plana. Moreover, many studies have found a relationship between the presence of dyslexia and/or language impairment and deficits in the normal right ear advantage found in dichotic listening paradigms. In this context, this study examined the relationship between planum temporale asymmetry and ear preference in dichotic listening performance in children with Developmental Dyslexia and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Subjects included 19 children with dyslexia (10 of whom had a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD), 23 children with ADHD, and 12 diagnosed normal control children. Dichotic listening data were not collected for 8 of the 12 normal control children and for 3 of the 23 ADHD children. Results revealed no significant difference between ADHD and dyslexic subjects in regard to ear advantage on the free recall dichotic listening task. In addition, although the directed dichotic listening tasks were not related to degree of planum asymmetry, as predicted, results indicated that subjects who consistently displayed an atypical left ear advantage tended to have larger right bank lengths than those who consistently displayed a typical right ear advantage. These findings support the notion that some individuals with dyslexia or language deficits tend to have a larger right planum temporale and that performance on dichotic listening tasks may reflect this relatively unusual pattern.","The dyslexia susceptibility locus DYX2 (chr. 6p21-p22) harbours two candidate genes, DCDC2 and KIAA0319. In 2006, Harold et al. reported evidence for interaction between both genes. Having previously identified a risk haplotype for dyslexia in DCDC2, but not KIAA0319, in German families, we also tested for interaction between this risk haplotype and KIAA0319. We found a nominally significant association for the quantitative dimension ""word reading"", the core phenotype in the study of Harold et al., which may be considered as supportive evidence.","- Label: Unchanged

Text A focuses on neurophysiological and behavioral characteristics of children with dyslexia, considering the symmetry of the planum temporale and its impact on listening tasks. Text B addresses the genetic aspects, identifying specific loci and gene interactions associated with dyslexia, particularly related to how these factors contribute to reading difficulties. Both texts explore different dimensions of dyslexia but maintain the core concept of it as a condition that affects reading and language processing abilities. Thus, the meaning of ""dyslexia"" remains consistent across the two texts, indicating no significant semantic drift."
59,Dyslexia,"Schoolchildren aged seven years underwent a complex reaction time (CRT) measurement and were followed up regarding language achievements and performance in gymnastics during the nine years of compulsory school. An analysis was made of the correlation between school results and CRT findings. In grade 3, there were large differences in psychomotor development between children with fast and slow CRT in both sexes. Only minor differences in school achievement were seen between girls in different CRT groups. Among the boys, however, many with a slow CRT were considered handicapped in language development, with dyslexia as the most important problem in addition to poor motoricity. They left compulsory school with poor results in Swedish, their native language, and gymnastics, and with a certificate that may reduce their changes of future studies and employment. The boys in general were inferior to the girls. The slow CRT boys, who were mainly considered to be developmentally delayed, also carried a risk of social maladjustment. It would appear to be important that psychophysical maturity receives attention at school, in addition to emotional and social factors. The school health services have an important responsibility in this respect.","Developmental dyslexia (decoding-based reading disorder; RD) is a complex trait with multifactorial origins at the genetic, neural, and cognitive levels. There is evidence that low-level sensory-processing deficits precede and underlie phonological problems, which are one of the best-documented aspects of RD. RD is also associated with impairments in integrating visual symbols with their corresponding speech sounds. Although causal relationships between sensory processing, print-speech integration, and fluent reading, and their neural bases are debated, these processes all require precise timing mechanisms across distributed brain networks. Neural excitability and neural noise are fundamental to these timing mechanisms. Here, we propose that neural noise stemming from increased neural excitability in cortical networks implicated in reading is one key distal contributor to RD.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia

- Text A (Schoolchildren context): Dyslexia is described as a significant problem associated with language development delays and poor motoricity in schoolchildren, particularly boys. It impacts their educational outcomes in subjects like language and gymnastics and is related to broader issues such as psychomotor development delays and social maladjustment risk.

- Text B (Neuropsychological and genetic context): Dyslexia, referred to as developmental dyslexia or RD (reading disorder), is discussed in terms of its multi-layered causes including genetic, neural, and cognitive origins. It highlights underlying sensory-processing deficits, integration issues between visual symbols and speech sounds, and the impact of neural excitability on reading. This representation is more focused on the matured scientific understanding of dyslexia involving precise neurological and genetic mechanisms.

- Reason: In Text A, dyslexia is primarily viewed as an educational problem concerning language development and its consequences on schooling and social aspects. In Text B, the discussion has evolved to emphasize dyslexia as a complex condition rooted in genetic, neural, and cognitive elements. The focus shifts from merely observing effects in educational performance to understanding underlying scientific origins and processes which articulate dyslexia as a broader neurodevelopmental disorder. This reflects a significant shift in the conception and detailed understanding of dyslexia from an educational and social problem to a well-defined neuropsychological condition."
60,Dyslexia,"We report a single case study of a patient, FL, who has a peripheral dyslexia with symptoms resembling attentional dyslexia. FL demonstrated impaired identification of letters within strings, and better identification of words than their constituent letters. We found that FL was impaired at both letter counting and same-case letter matching with letter strings, and his matching and naming performance were strongly affected by letter spacing. The effects of these visual variables on performance suggest an early locus to FL's deficit. We propose that letter identification was disrupted by abnormal lateral masking and poor location coding within words. These peripheral processing deficits were reduced when the task required focused attention on the central letter location. Nevertheless, even with impaired letter coding, word representations could be accessed to some degree, via supra-letter units. We discuss the implications of the data for understanding normal reading.","The genetic basis of complex neurological disorders involving language are poorly understood, partly due to the multiple additive genetic risk factors that are thought to be responsible. Furthermore, these conditions are often syndromic in that they have a range of endophenotypes that may be associated with the disorder and that may be present in different combinations in patients. However, the emergence of individual genes implicated across multiple disorders has suggested that they might share similar underlying genetic mechanisms. The CNTNAP2 gene is an excellent example of this, as it has recently been implicated in a broad range of phenotypes including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual disability, dyslexia and language impairment. This review considers the evidence implicating CNTNAP2 in these conditions, the genetic risk factors and mutations that have been identified in patient and population studies and how these relate to patient phenotypes. The role of CNTNAP2 is examined in the context of larger neurogenetic networks during development and disorder, given what is known regarding the regulation and function of this gene. Understanding the role of CNTNAP2 in diverse neurological disorders will further our understanding of how combinations of individual genetic risk factors can contribute to complex conditions.

The text delves into psychological and neurological assessments of how dyslexia affects an individual's ability to process written text at a word and letter level. In contrast, Text B shifts the perspective of ""dyslexia"" significantly to include not just the symptomatic issues in reading and language processing but also its etiological connections to genetics, linking it with other neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. This elevates the conversation from a mere symptomatic discussion to genetic and broader neurogenetic implications, showing a clear semantic drift from a narrow to a comprehensive, genetically aligned understanding of the condition. Thus, the usage of the term ""dyslexia"" in Text B represents a broader, multifaceted, and integrated neurological perspective compared to the more isolated and symptom-focused understanding in Text A."
61,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is a specific language-based disorder of constitutional origin, characterized by difficulties in phonological processing. The Arabic language differs in many aspects from foreign languages and the few previously designed Arabic tests for assessment of dyslexia did not pay attention to phonological awareness problems. This necessitates the design of an Arabic test which could properly assign specific difficulties among Arabic reading dyslexic children, including phonological awareness as a major contributing factor for dyslexia.","People with developmental dyslexia (DD) have been shown to be impaired in tasks that require the processing of multiple visual elements in parallel. It has been suggested that this deficit originates from disturbed visual attentional functions. The parameter-based assessment of visual attention based on Bundesen's () theory of visual attention allows one to identify and quantify the underlying deficits. The present study provides the first groupwise comparison between children with DD (n = 12; mean age 9.84 years) and typically developing children (n = 12; mean age 9.87 years) with regard to intact and disturbed components of visual attention. From the performance on whole- and partial-report tasks, we derived individual parameter estimates of four different parameters: visual processing speed, storage capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM), laterality of attentional weighting and efficiency of top-down control. Groupwise comparisons revealed that general attentional resources, processing speed and VSTM storage capacity, are impaired in children with DD compared to typically developing children. In contrast, selectivity parameters, laterality of attentional selection and attentional top-down control did not differ between these groups. Relating the current findings to previous results, obtained in highly comparable methodological settings, from single cases of children with DD, and from a group of adults with DD, we conclude that slowed perceptual processing speed is a primary visual attentional deficit in DD. Furthermore, reduced VSTM storage capacity seems to modulate the difficulties in written language processing imposed by the disorder.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Dyslexia"" is consistently used to refer to a disorder characterized by difficulties in specific aspects related to language and visual processing, which impacts reading abilities. In Text A, the focus is mainly on phonological awareness difficulties, especially within the context of designing tests for Arabic-speaking dyslexic children. Text B explores more specifically the visual attentional deficits in children with developmental dyslexia (DD), emphasizing challenges in processing multiple visual elements, which also affect language processing. Despite the different specific aspects highlighted (phonological in A and visual attentional in B), both texts address dyslexia as a developmental disorder affecting reading and related cognitive functions, without a shift in the fundamental meaning or interpretation of the term ""dyslexia."" Hence, the semantic drift between these two periods remains unchanged."
62,Dyslexia,"Two groups of pupils from special tract learning schools were randomly selected for this study. The first group (55 pupils) fulfilled the World Federation of Neurology (WFN) definition of developmental dyslexia (DD). The second group (retarded readers, RR) included 20 pupils with IQs between 80 and 90. A group of normal readers was randomly selected from the 5 school grades as a control group. This study showed that the performance IQ of the DD group was not only higher than the verbal IQ, but the DD group also had superior performance IQ compared to normal readers. In the arithmetic achievement test, both DD and RR groups had nearly similar total scores, which were significantly lower than that of the control group. None of the arithmetic subtests could differentiate between DD and RR groups. In linguistic achievement tests, only spontaneous writing and oral spelling could differentiate subjects with DD from the RR group.","Identification of specific neurophysiological dysfunctions resulting in selective reading difficulty (dyslexia) has remained elusive. In addition to impaired reading development, individuals with dyslexia frequently exhibit behavioral deficits in perceptual adaptation. Here, we assessed neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition in adults and children with dyslexia for a wide variety of stimuli, spoken words, written words, visual objects, and faces. For every stimulus type, individuals with dyslexia exhibited significantly diminished neural adaptation compared to controls in stimulus-specific cortical areas. Better reading skills in adults and children with dyslexia were associated with greater repetition-induced neural adaptation. These results highlight a dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation as a core neurophysiological difference in dyslexia that may underlie impaired reading development. Reduced neurophysiological adaptation may relate to prior reports of reduced behavioral adaptation in dyslexia and may reveal a difference in brain functions that ultimately results in a specific reading impairment.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: Both Text A and Text B use the target word ""dyslexia"" to describe a specific learning disability characterized by difficulties with accurate or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling abilities. In Text A, the focus is on differentiating between developmental dyslexia and other types of reading difficulties using various cognitive and achievement tests, still maintaining the fundamental context of dyslexia as a learning disorder affecting reading capabilities. Text B delves deeper into the neurophysiological aspects of dyslexia, investigating neural adaptation differences in individuals with dyslexia compared to controls, yet it still fundamentally discusses dyslexia in the context of a reading and perceptual impairment. Thus, the core meaning and contextual use around the word ""dyslexia"" as a specific type of reading disorder have remained consistent between the two texts, despite deeper insights into the neurological underpinnings in the more recent text."
63,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia, specific reading disability, which seriously impairs school achievement and interferes with the acquisition of information, is estimated to affect about 3-15% of the population. In a longitudinal study started in the University of Jyväskylä researchers will follow the development of language and other cognitive skills of babies of 160 families from birth to about 10 years' age in search for early precursors of dyslexia. Trough screening parents for dyslexia we hope to obtain new information about specific features of reading and writing problems in adulthood, which helps us to focus our search for important features of early language problems linked to development of dyslexia.

The present study investigated effects of lexical-semantic priming in 20- and 24-month-olds at-risk for dyslexia and typically developing controls in two ERP experiments. In both experiments an early component assumed to reflect facilitated lexical processing for primed words was enhanced in the at-risk group compared to the control group. Moreover, an N400-like response which was prominent in the control group was attenuated or absent in at-risk children. Results suggest that deficiencies in young children at-risk for dyslexia are not restricted to perceptual and lower-level phonological abilities, but also affect higher order linguistic skills such as lexical and semantic processing.","- Label: Unchanged

Text B looks into the genetic bases by finding polymorphisms associated with dyslexia, examining another layer of the development of the condition but still within the central understanding of dyslexia as a developmental reading disability. Therefore, the fundamental conceptualization of ""dyslexia"" as a specific learning difficulty related primarily to reading and possibly influenced by genetic factors remains unchanged between the two texts."
65,Dyslexia,"It is argued that much of the confusion which has arisen as to the nature of dyslexia is because retarded readers have so frequently been studied as if they formed a qualitatively homogeneous group. It is suggested that in fact reading is not a unitary process, but that it involves the acquisition of a succession of skills; and that different retarded readers may break down at different stages in the acquisition of these. There may be types of retarded reader who are unable (1) to analyse complex visual shapes; or (2) to analyse whole word sounds into phonemes; or (3) to make simple regular grapheme-phoneme associations; or (4) to grasp irregularities in these; or (5) to group single words into phrases and sentences. Each of these disabilities may be associated with a particular type of deficiency in conceptual thinking.","Achieving biologically interpretable neural-biomarkers and features from neuroimaging datasets is a challenging task in an MRI-based dyslexia study. This challenge becomes more pronounced when the needed MRI datasets are collected from multiple heterogeneous sources with inconsistent scanner settings. This study presents a method of improving the biological interpretation of dyslexia's neural-biomarkers from MRI datasets sourced from publicly available open databases. The proposed system utilized a modified histogram normalization (MHN) method to improve dyslexia neural-biomarker interpretations by mapping the pixels' intensities of low-quality input neuroimages to range between the low-intensity region of interest (ROIlow) and high-intensity region of interest (ROIhigh) of the high-quality image. This was achieved after initial image smoothing using the Gaussian filter method with an isotropic kernel of size 4mm. The performance of the proposed smoothing and normalization methods was evaluated based on three image post-processing experiments: ROI segmentation, gray matter (GM) tissues volume estimations, and deep learning (DL) classifications using Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) and pre-trained models in a MATLAB working environment. The three experiments were preceded by some pre-processing tasks such as image resizing, labelling, patching, and non-rigid registration. Our results showed that the best smoothing was achieved at a scale value, σ = 1.25 with a 0.9% increment in the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Results from the three image post-processing experiments confirmed the efficacy of the proposed methods. Evidence emanating from our analysis showed that using the proposed MHN and Gaussian smoothing methods can improve comparability of image features and neural-biomarkers of dyslexia with a statistically significantly high disc similarity coefficient (DSC) index, low mean square error (MSE), and improved tissue volume estimations. After 10 repeated 10-fold cross-validation, the highest accuracy achieved by DL models is 94.7% at a 95% confidence interval (CI) level. Finally, our finding confirmed that the proposed MHN method significantly outperformed the normalization method of the state-of-the-art histogram matching.","###Answer:

66,Dyslexia,"The purposes of this study were to investigate (a) whether children in families with a positive history of dyslexia were more likely to show delays in language development than children without family risk and (b) whether a delayed onset of expressive language (late talking) predicted later language development. We analyzed the language development of 200 children longitudinally at 14, 24, 30, and 42 months and assessed their symbolic play at 14 months. Half of the children (N = 106) were from families with a history of dyslexia (the Dyslexia Risk [DR] group), and other children served as age-matched controls. Parental reports and structured tests were used to assess children's receptive and expressive language and symbolic play. No differences emerged between the two groups in receptive language, symbolic play, or on the Bayley MDI. The groups, however, diverged in expressive language measures. The maximum sentence length at 2 years and object naming and inflectional morphology skills at 3.5 years were higher for the control group than for the DR group. Reynell receptive score at 2.5 years provided the greatest unique contribution to the prediction of the children's receptive and expressive language. Children's risk status did not contribute to receptive language, but provided a significant contribution to their expressive language at 3.5 years, even after the variance associated with parental education and children's previous language skills was controlled. Late talkers in the DR group differed from the other members of the DR group in both receptive and expressive language at 3.5 years, although in the control group children with a late-talking history performed at age-level expectations. The findings suggest that children with a familial risk for dyslexia and with a history of late talking are at higher risk for delays in language acquisition than children without the familial risk for dyslexia.","Recent research studies have shown that increased letter spacing has a positive effect on the reading ability of dyslexic individuals. This study aims to investigate the effect of spacing on the readability of different fonts for children with and without dyslexia. Results did not support the hypothesis of better performance among children with dyslexia when reading text in Dyslexie than in other fonts. They, however, revealed that only spacing plays a role in enhancing dyslexic individuals' reading performance because Dyslexie and the Times New Roman interspaced font have no difference. Furthermore, the negative effect of the unfriendly fonts Times New Roman Italic and Curlz MT was eliminated through increased interletter spacing.","- Label: Unchanged

67,Dyslexia,"Many aspects of vision have been investigated in developmental dyslexia. Some research suggests deficits in vergence control (e.g. Buzzelli, 1991, Optom. Vision Sci. 68, 842-846), although ability to control vergence across saccades has not yet been investigated. We have explored this question indirectly using Enright's (1996 Vision Res. 36, 307-312.) sequential stereopsis task. The task requires observers to set two adjacent targets (whose textures cannot be resolved simultaneously if either is fixated) to appear equi-distant. Enright has argued that sequential stereopsis stereoacuity thresholds offer an indication of vergence control across saccades. We report two experiments using a total of 17 dyslexic and 18 control adults. Performance was measured on a sequential stereopsis task and an ordinary 'simultaneous' stereopsis task. No significant differences between groups were found. However, whereas practice of the sequential task lowered control group thresholds on the simultaneous task, for the dyslexic group it significantly raised thresholds, suggesting that visual fatigue is especially important in investigations of visual functions in dyslexia. Although the small samples used limit conclusions at this stage, the main sequential stereopsis results suggest that, if Enright is correct, dyslexic adults can show normal vergence control across saccades.","Previous research has associated a prolonged attentional blink (AB) with adult dyslexia [Hari, R., Valta, M., & Uutela, K. (1999). Prolonged attentional dwell time in dyslexic adults. Neuroscience Letters, 271, 202-204]. The AB represents a limitation in temporal information processing, estimated as the time interval between two targets necessary for accurate recall (e.g., [Raymond, J. E., Shapiro, K. L., & Arnell, K. M. (1992). Temporary suppression of visual processing in an RSVP task: An attentional blink? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 18, 849-860]). Utilizing single- and dual-target procedures, this investigation extended upon previous research. When controlling for baseline sensitivity as estimated in the dual-target condition, there was no significant difference between dyslexic and control performance. Finding no evidence of a single-target task difference or prolonged AB effect in dyslexia, it is suggested that baseline sensitivity differences relate to difficulties with task demands in dyslexic readers.","- Target word: Dyslexia

### Label: Changed

### Reason:
The usage of ""dyslexia"" in Text A and Text B has shifted to some extent in terms of the focus of research and the characteristics explored. In Text A, research is concentrated on the physical and visual aspects such as control across saccades and visual fatigue related to dyslexia. In contrast, Text B explores cognitive processing aspects, particularly the timing and attention elements, such as attentional blink and task demand difficulties in dyslexic individuals. This difference indicates a broader conceptualization and application of the term ""dyslexia"", where Text A focuses more on the physiological elements while Text B takes a psychological and cognitive approach. This distinction in focus and research implications suggests a notable shift in the connotation and understanding of dyslexia over time. Hence, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Changed""."
68,Dyslexia,"H.M. is a 17-year-old girl of at least average intelligence and with an above-average oral vocabulary. She is impaired at non-word reading in comparison to word reading. She is incapable of reading any long nonsense words or long unusual regular words correctly. Many of her non-word reading responses are lexicalizations. She reads non-words homophonic with real words better than she reads non-words that are not homophonic with real words. Her reading age is 10 years 11 months. A large proportion of her reading errors are derivational or visual paralexias. She makes no semantic errors or errors of regularization and few neologistic responses. H.M. is not influenced by the dimensions of spelling-to-sound regularity and word length. There is no effect of word class on single-word reading although a function word deficit is present when continuous text is read aloud. H.M. is impaired at word reading when the stimulus items are distorted in a manner that reduces the potential for global perception. H.M.'s spelling errors are primarily phonological, though more complex errors are made than those characteristic of surface agraphics. All of these features are consistent with reported cases of acquired phonological dyslexia. H.M. may be confidently regarded as a developmental phonological dyslexic.","In this project, the hypothesis of an auditory temporal processing deficit in dyslexia was tested by examining auditory processing in relation to phonological skills in two contrasting groups of five-year-old preschool children, a familial high risk and a familial low risk group. Participants were individually matched for gender, age, non-verbal IQ, school environment, and parental educational level. Psychophysical thresholds were estimated for gap-detection, frequency modulation detection, and tone-in-noise detection using a three-interval forced-choice adaptive staircase paradigm embedded within a computer game. Phonological skills were measured by tasks assessing phonological awareness, rapid serial naming, and verbal short-term memory. Significant group differences were found for phonological awareness and letter knowledge. In contrast, none of the auditory tasks differentiated significantly between both groups. However, both frequency modulation and tone-in-noise detection were significantly related to phonological awareness. This relation with phonological skills was not present for gap-detection.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" refers to a specific learning difficulty that particularly affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. Text A discusses a case study of an individual with developmental phonological dyslexia, focusing on detailed characteristics of the individual's reading and spelling abilities. Text B explores a research hypothesis related to auditory processing deficits in dyslexia in preschool children, looking at phonological abilities and their relation to auditory tasks. Both texts use ""dyslexia"" in the context of a condition involving challenges with language skills, particularly reading and spelling, suggesting that the core meaning of the word has remained consistent across the time periods covered by the texts. Hence, the semantic usage of ""dyslexia"" has not significantly changed.

69,Dyslexia,"Accurate reading of irregular words is generally assumed to require intact lexical reading mechanisms. A nonlexical mechanism is usually deemed insufficient for this type of stimulus processing. The maximum level of accuracy attainable by nonlexical means, however, has not been adequately evaluated. We now describe a patient with acquired dyslexia due to impaired lexical reading mechanisms who retained the ability to read irregular words. The patient's poor performance on tasks requiring lexical decision and access to word meaning provided evidence that his lexical mechanisms were impaired. Nevertheless, errors on irregular words became apparent only with special tests that circumvented the patient's ability to use his intact speaking vocabulary to ensure that reading responses were words. The results demonstrate that relatively accurate reading of irregular words is possible despite damage to lexical mechanisms and that this can be achieved by filtering potential responses through the speaking vocabulary.","Auditory cortex volume and shape differences have been observed in the context of phonetic learning, musicianship and dyslexia. Heschl's gyrus, which includes primary auditory cortex, displays large anatomical variability across individuals and hemispheres. Given this variability, manual labelling is the gold standard for segmenting HG, but is time consuming and error prone. Our novel toolbox, called 'Toolbox for the Automated Segmentation of HG' or TASH, automatically segments HG in brain structural MRI data, and extracts measures including its volume, surface area and cortical thickness. TASH builds upon FreeSurfer, which provides an initial segmentation of auditory regions, and implements further steps to perform finer auditory cortex delineation. We validate TASH by showing significant relationships between HG volumes obtained using manual labelling and using TASH, in three independent datasets acquired on different scanners and field strengths, and by showing good qualitative segmentation. We also present two applications of TASH, demonstrating replication and extension of previously published findings of relationships between HG volumes and (a) phonetic learning, and (b) musicianship. In sum, TASH effectively segments HG in a fully automated and reproducible manner, opening up a wide range of applications in the domains of expertise, disease, genetics and brain plasticity.","### Label: Changed

### Reason:
In Text A, ""dyslexia"" is discussed in the context of a clinical neuropsychology case where an individual suffers from acquired dyslexia due to damage to specific lexical reading mechanisms. The target word here is closely associated with the impairment of the ability to read, specifically affecting the processing of irregular words and access to word meaning due to brain damage.

In Text B, ""dyslexia"" is contextualized within a study examining differences in brain morphology, particularly in Heschl's gyrus and the primary auditory cortex. This text highlights a broader implication of dyslexia, linking it not only to reading impairments but also to anatomical brain differences and how these might impact phonetic learning and musicianship. Thus, ""dyslexia"" evolves from a discussion of merely a reading disorder to a more complex condition characterized by particular brain structure variations that could also influence auditory processing and other cognitive abilities related to sound.

The semantic drift is marked in the expansion of the understanding of dyslexia from a primary focus on reading impairment to include broader neurobiological substrates that affect multiple aspects of cognitive processing related to language and possibly other auditory skills."
70,Dyslexia,"Abnormalities of functional connection between specialized areas in the human brain may underlie the symptoms which constitute the schizophrenia syndrome. Callosal and intrahemispheric fibres may be equally involved. The clinical emergence of symptoms in the later stages of brain maturation may be dependent on myelination of these fibre groups, both of which have extended myelination cycles. Ontogenetically earlier variants of the same mechanism could theoretically result in dyslexia and the syndromes of Kanner and Gilles de la Tourette. As new and unique extensions of specialized function emerge within the evolving brain, biological trial and error of connection both within and between them may produce individuals possessing phylogenetically advanced abilities, or equally, others possessing a wide range of abnormalities including those which comprise the schizophrenia syndrome. A dormant phenotypic potential for schizophrenia may exist in individuals who never develop symptoms during the course of a lifetime though some of these may become clinically apparent under the influence of various precipitating factors. It is concluded that abnormal functional connection and its normal and ""supernormal"" counterparts may be natural, essential, and inevitable consequences of brain evolution, and that this may have been so throughout the history of vertebrate brain evolution.","The Mental Attributes Profiling System was developed in 2002 (Laouris and Makris, Proceedings of multilingual & cross-cultural perspectives on Dyslexia, Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C, 2002), to provide a multimodal evaluation of the learning potential and abilities of young children's brains. The method is based on the assessment of non-verbal abilities using video-like interfaces and was compared to more established methodologies in (Papadopoulos, Laouris, Makris, Proceedings of IDA 54th annual conference, San Diego, 2003), such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Watkins et al., Psychol Sch 34(4):309-319, 1997). To do so, various tests have been applied to a population of 134 children aged 7-12 years old. This paper addresses the issue of identifying a minimal set of variables that are able to accurately predict the learning abilities of a given child. The use of Machine Learning technologies to do this provides the advantage of making no prior assumptions about the nature of the data and eliminating natural bias associated with data processing carried out by humans. Kohonen's Self Organising Maps (Kohonen, Biol Cybern 43:59-69, 1982) algorithm is able to split a population into groups based on large and complex sets of observations. Once the population is split, the individual groups can then be probed for their defining characteristics providing insight into the rationale of the split. The characteristics identified form the basis of classification systems that are able to accurately predict which group an individual will belong to, using only a small subset of the tests available. The specifics of this methodology are detailed herein, and the resulting classification systems provide an effective tool to prognose the learning abilities of new subjects.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dyslexia"" is discussed in the context of neurological research and theorized as a potential byproduct of brain evolution, associated indirectly with the development of other complex syndromes and functional connections within the brain. The word is employed in a speculative, theoretical framework linking brain maturation and functional connections to various developmental disorders, including dyslexia. In contrast, Text B treats ""dyslexia"" as a specific learning disability with concrete assessment methods. It discusses a developed system for evaluating and predicting the learning abilities of children, highlighting dyslexia in a focused, practical application regarding educational and psychological assessments. The shift from theoretical and broadly neurodevelopmental associations to specific, applied methods in educational settings displays a change in connotation and context employed, thus marking a semantic drift in the usage of ""dyslexia"" towards a more structured and defined educational context."
71,Dyslexia,"The hypothesis of a general (i.e. cross-modal) temporal processing deficit in dyslexia was tested by examining rapid processing in both the auditory and the visual system in the same children with dyslexia. Participants were 10- to 12-year-old dyslexic readers and age-matched normal reading controls. Psychophysical thresholds were estimated for auditory gap and visual double flash detection, using a two-interval, two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. Significant group differences were found for the auditory and the visual test. Furthermore, temporal processing measures were significantly related to word and pseudo-word reading skills. As 70% of the dyslexic readers had significantly higher thresholds than controls for both auditory and visual temporal processing, the evidence tends to support the hypothesis of a general temporal processing deficit in children with dyslexia.","Findings concerning the relation between dyslexia and speech perception deficits are inconsistent in the literature. This study examined the relation in Chinese children using a more homogeneous sample-children with phonological dyslexia. Two experimental tasks were administered to a group of Chinese children with phonological dyslexia, a group of age-matched control children, and a group of adults. In addition to a categorical perception task, a selective adaptation task was carried out. The results indicated that Chinese children with phonological dyslexia were less consistent than both the child and adult control groups in identifying stimuli within a given phonetic category. Furthermore, they did not show any significant adaptation effects in the selective adaptation task even when the adapting stimulus was identical to an endpoint stimulus in the test continuum. It seems that children with phonological dyslexia have a general deficiency in representing and processing speech stimuli.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used with a consistent primary semantic focus on reading difficulties associated with the condition, whether approached from the angle of general temporal processing deficits (Text A) or specific phonological challenges (Text B). Although the methods and specifics of the studies differ (one emphasizing a more generalized sensory processing deficit and the other focusing on phonological aspects in a particular language), the underlying association of ""dyslexia"" with impairments in reading remains consistent across both texts. Neither of the texts suggests a shift in the fundamental understanding or definition of dyslexia, thus keeping the word's meaning stable over time in these contexts."
72,Dyslexia,"In order to study face recognition in relative isolation from visual processes that may also contribute to object recognition and reading, we investigated CK, a man with normal face recognition but with object agnosia and dyslexia caused by a closed-head injury. We administered recognition tests of up right faces, of family resemblance, of age-transformed faces, of caricatures, of cartoons, of inverted faces, and of face features, of disguised faces, of perceptually degraded faces, of fractured faces, of faces parts, and of faces whose parts were made of objects. We compared CK's performance with that of at least 12 control participants. We found that CK performed as well as controls as long as the face was upright and retained the configurational integrity among the internal facial features, the eyes, nose, and mouth. This held regardless of whether the face was disguised or degraded and whether the face was represented as a photo, a caricature, a cartoon, or a face composed of objects. In the last case, CK perceived the face but, unlike controls, was rarely aware that it was composed of objects. When the face, or just the internal features, were inverted or when the configurational gestalt was broken by fracturing the face or misaligning the top and bottom halves, CK's performance suffered far more than that of controls. We conclude that face recognition normally depends on two systems: (1) a holistic, face-specific system that is dependent on orientationspecific coding of second-order relational features (internal), which is intact in CK and (2) a part-based object-recognition system, which is damaged in CK and which contributes to face recognition when the face stimulus does not satisfy the domain-specific conditions needed to activate the face system. ","The knowledge that reading and phonological awareness are mainly reciprocally related has hardly influenced the status of a phonological awareness deficit as the main cause of a reading deficit in dyslexia. Because direct proofs for this theory are still lacking we investigated children at familial risk for dyslexia in kindergarten and first grade. The familial risk was genuine; 40% developed reading deficits in first grade. However, we did not find any relationship between a phonological awareness or other phonological processing deficits in kindergarten and reading deficits in first grade. Finally, we did not find evidence for the claim that a phonological awareness deficit assumedly causes a reading deficit via 'unstable' or otherwise corrupted letter-speech sound associations. Although earlier research indicated letter knowledge as another significant determinant of later reading deficits, we found no support for this claim. Letter knowledge learning and learning to associate and integrate letters and speech sound are different processes and only problems in the latter process seem directly linked to the development of a reading deficit. The nature of this deficit and the impact it might have on multisensory processing in the whole reading network presents a major challenge to future reading and dyslexia research.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
The usage of the term ""dyslexia"" in both Text A and Text B refers consistently to a condition impacting an individual's ability to process and recognize written language. In Text A, dyslexia is mentioned as a specific impairment (associated with object agnosia) resulting from a closed-head injury, where the subject has difficulties in reading despite normal face recognition. This points towards dyslexia as a disorder affecting reading abilities due to brain damage. In Text B, dyslexia is addressed in the context of researching the causes and correlates of reading deficits, with a focus on phonological awareness and its relationship to dyslexia. Although the aspect of dyslexia being considered may vary slightly, the core definition—as a significant reading and processing difficulty—remains consistent. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift between the two time periods in the fundamental understanding and application of the term ""dyslexia."""
73,Dyslexia,"It has been proposed that dyslexia is the result of a deficit in the magnocellular system. Reduced metacontrast masking in dyslexic readers has been taken as support for this view. In metacontrast, a masking stimulus reduces the visibility of a spatially adjacent target stimulus when the target stimulus precedes the masking stimulus by about 30-100 msec. Recent evidence indicates that the latency difference between the magnocellular and parvocellular subcortical pathways is at most 20 msec and may be as small as only 5 msec, or even less. This makes it difficult to attribute the latency in metacontrast to the latency differences between the magnocellular and parvocellular systems. It is therefore problematic to attribute reduced metacontrast masking to a deficit in the magnocellular system.","People with dyslexia have difficulty learning to read and many lack fluent word recognition as adults. In a novel task that borrows elements of the 'word superiority' and 'word inversion' paradigms, we investigate whether holistic word recognition is impaired in dyslexia. In Experiment 1 students with dyslexia and controls judged the similarity of pairs of 6- and 7-letter words or pairs of words whose letters had been partially jumbled. The stimuli were presented in both upright and inverted form with orthographic regularity and orientation randomized from trial to trial. While both groups showed sensitivity to orthographic regularity, both word inversion and letter jumbling were more detrimental to skilled than dyslexic readers supporting the idea that the latter may read in a more analytic fashion. Experiment 2 employed the same task but using shorter, 4- and 5-letter words and a design where orthographic regularity and stimuli orientation was held constant within experimental blocks to encourage the use of either holistic or analytic processing. While there was no difference in reaction time between the dyslexic and control groups for inverted stimuli, the students with dyslexia were significantly slower than controls for upright stimuli. These findings suggest that holistic word recognition, which is largely based on the detection of orthographic regularity, is impaired in dyslexia.","### Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The focus is on describing a hypothesis related to dyslexia that involves deficits in a specific visual processing system known as the magnocellular system. It discusses the neurological underpinnings including response times of visual pathways. The text treats dyslexia primarily as a neurological condition linked closely to specific sensory processing deficits.

- Text B: This text emphasizes the practical implications of dyslexia, focusing on learning difficulties, especially in recognizing and processing words. It discusses specific experimental studies assessing holistic versus analytic word recognition in individuals with dyslexia, highlighting the challenges they face with standard reading strategies.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, dyslexia is primarily discussed in the context of neurological deficits and sensory processing, providing a more technical, medical perspective focused on underlying sensory malfunction. In contrast, Text B shifts toward the pedagogical and cognitive aspects of dyslexia, discussing its impact on learning and reading strategies, portraying a shift towards the functional challenges faced by individuals. This implies a notable expansion in the scope and understanding of dyslexia from a purely neurological disorder to encompassing broader educational and cognitive dimensions. These changes reflect a significant semantic drift in the word's usage from a strictly medical to a more functional and educational context."
74,Dyslexia,"We measured brain activity, perceptual thresholds, and reading performance in a group of dyslexic and normal readers to test the hypothesis that dyslexia is associated with an abnormality in the magnocellular (M) pathway of the early visual system. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activity in conditions designed to preferentially stimulate the M pathway. Speed discrimination thresholds, which measure the minimal increase in stimulus speed that is just noticeable, were acquired in a paradigm modeled after a previous study of M pathway-lesioned monkeys. Dyslexics showed reduced brain activity compared with controls both in primary visual cortex (V1) and in several extrastriate areas, including area MT and adjacent motion-sensitive areas (MT+) that are believed to receive a predominant M pathway input. There was a strong three-way correlation between brain activity, speed discrimination thresholds, and reading speed. Subjects with higher V1 and MT+ responses had lower perceptual thresholds (better performance) and were faster readers. These results support the hypothesis for an M pathway abnormality in dyslexia and imply strong relationships between the integrity of the M pathway, visual motion perception, and reading ability.","Statistical learning (SL), the ability to pick up patterns in sensory input, serves as one of the building blocks of language acquisition. Although SL has been studied extensively in developmental dyslexia (DD), much less is known about the way SL evolves over time. The handful of studies examining this question were all limited to the acquisition of motor sequential knowledge or highly learned segmented linguistic units. Here we examined memory consolidation of statistical regularities in adults with DD and typically developed (TD) readers by using auditory SL requiring the segmentation of units from continuous input, which represents one of the earliest learning challenges in language acquisition. DD and TD groups were exposed to tones in a probabilistically determined sequential structure varying in difficulty and subsequently tested for recognition of novel short sequences that adhered to this statistical pattern in immediate and delayed-recall sessions separated by a night of sleep. SL performance of the DD group at the easy and hard difficulty levels was poorer than that of the TD group in the immediate-recall session. Importantly, DD participants showed a significant overnight deterioration in SL performance at the medium difficulty level compared to TD, who instead showed overnight stabilization of the learned information. These findings imply that SL difficulties in DD may arise not only from impaired initial learning but also due to a failure to consolidate statistically structured information into long-term memory. We hypothesize that these deficits disrupt the typical course of language acquisition in those with DD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, ""dyslexia"" consistently refers to a condition linked to impaired reading abilities due to neural or perceptual differences. Text A discusses the condition in relation to abnormal brain activity in specific neural pathways known for processing visual motion, and correlates this with reading performance in dyslexic individuals. Text B addresses a different aspect of dyslexia, focusing on statistical learning challenges and memory consolidation issues in individuals with developmental dyslexia, which also implicates cognitive processes related to language and reading skills. Despite the different scientific approaches and focuses of the texts, the underlying representation of ""dyslexia"" as a learning disorder affecting reading and associated cognitive functions remains the same. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift observed in the usage of the term ""dyslexia"" between the two texts."
75,Dyslexia,"Developmental dyslexia is a specific reading disability that affects 5-10% of the population. Recent studies have suggested that dyslexics may experience a deficit in the visual magnocellular pathway. The most extensively studied prediction deriving from this hypothesis is impaired contrast sensitivity to transient, low-luminance stimuli at low spatial frequencies. However, the findings are inconsistent across studies and even seemingly contradictory. In the present study, we administered several different paradigms for assessing temporal contrast sensitivity, and found both impaired and normal contrast sensitivity within the same group of dyslexic participants. Under sequential presentation, in a temporal forced choice paradigm, dyslexics showed impaired sensitivity to both drifting and flickering gratings. However, under simultaneous presentation, with a spatial forced choice paradigm, dyslexics' sensitivity did not differ from that of the controls. Within each paradigm, dyslexics' sensitivity was poorer at higher temporal frequencies, consistent with the magnocellular hypothesis. These results suggest that a basic perceptual impairment in dyslexics may be their limited ability to retain-and-compare perceptual traces across brief intervals.","DIP2A mutation is associated with abnormal brain development and diseases including dyslexia, autism and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role and the involved mechanisms remain unknown. To study the biological function of DIP2A during mESCs neural differentiation in early neural development, we generated a Dip2a homozygous knockout 46C ESC cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. The eighth exon of Dip2a gene was replaced with PGK-Puro-P2A-mCherry. This 46C-Dip2a KO cell line offers a useful resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms of DIP2A in the process of cell fate determination, as well as a potential source of building disease mouse model.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: Developmental dyslexia is described as a specific reading disability affecting a certain percentage of the population, emphasizing its impact on visual processing capabilities, particularly in contrast sensitivity in temporal visual stimuli. It focuses on a perceptual impairment that varies under different testing scenarios.
- Text B: Dyslexia in this context is linked with a genetic mutation (DIP2A mutation), associating the condition with other neurological diseases such as autism and Alzheimer's. It discusses using CRISPR technology for gene editing in studying early neural development and the potential mechanisms of dyslexia related to genetic factors.
- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, dyslexia is explored primarily within the context of perceptual and cognitive effects specifically related to reading and visual processing. In Text B, dyslexia is discussed in a broader neurological and genetic context, connecting it with broader developmental diseases and exploring genetic underpinnings, indicating a shift in focus from reading-specific impairments to a broader biological and developmental framework. This represents a semantic drift from a specialized educational and psychological interpretation to a more biomedical and genetic-oriented understanding."
76,Dyslexia,"The role of visual processing in dyslexia continues to stir controversy. Previous research using early components of visual evoked potentials (VEP's) has revealed differences in visual processing between dyslexics and controls. VEP's have successfully indexed binocular advantage. Intrasensory functioning could conceivably be deficient in dyslexics. This study recorded VEP's in response to contrast-reversing checkerboards binocularly and monocularly from dyslexic and control children. The overall monocular and binocular amplitudes of the major positive peaks (P100) were greater for controls than dyslexics; however, contrary to the original hypothesis, the magnitude of binocular advantage was higher for dyslexics than for the control children. Stimulus factors had an effect, but did not interact with reading ability.","Dyslexia is hard to diagnose in a second language. Poor performance on a test of reading may be caused by poor language proficiency in the second language or by limited schooling rather than by poor reading ability per se. This confound was supported in a study of 88 adult second language learners and 65 native language speakers. The incidence of dyslexia in the second language learners varied widely depending on the measure of reading. In order to reduce language and schooling confounds, a dynamic test of acquisition of basic decoding ability was developed. In the dynamic test, participants are taught three novel letters and to synthesise the letter sounds into new words. Results from the study indicated that the dynamic test provided results in accordance with the current IDA definition of dyslexia, while significantly reducing the influence second language vocabulary and amount of schooling. With the dynamic measure, the same cut-off point between dyslexic and non-dyslexic performance appeared valid in both native language speakers and second language learners.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the focus on dyslexia primarily revolves around physiological and sensory aspects, particularly visual processing and how it differs between dyslexics and controls using specific medical measurements like VEP's. This suggests a scientific and clinically-oriented approach focusing on underlying neurological or cognitive deficits related to dyslexia. On the other hand, Text B discusses dyslexia in the context of second language learning, highlighting challenges in diagnosis due to confounding factors such as language proficiency and educational background. This perspective introduces a broader, more applied understanding of dyslexia that goes beyond purely medical or physiological interpretations to include educational and linguistic dimensions. This indicates a shift in understanding and approaching dyslexia from a purely clinical view to a more inclusive view that considers environmental and educational factors."
77,Dyslexia,"The contribution of peripheral, data-driven effects is contrasted with conceptual, 'top-down' effects to the reading performance of 2 subjects with neglect dyslexia following a single right hemisphere lesion. Several tasks were administered, manipulating the physical, lexical or morphemic properties of the stimuli in an attempt to establish whether the attentional deficit disrupts reading at an early or late stage of processing. Both subjects were impaired at detecting elementary stimulus features on the left side of the display but were even more impaired at identifying conjoined features. One subject's performance was influenced by structural manipulations which altered the low-level representation of the stimulus. The other was less affected by structural changes of the stimuli but was influenced by the lexical and morphemic status of the words. This apparent double dissociation is interpreted as arising from a graded attentional deficit at a single locus, early in the reading process where low-level information is detected. When the deficit is not severe sufficient information may be picked up and may interact with higher order lexical knowledge to offset partially the peripheral malfunction. For a severe attentional deficit, top-down knowledge is not engaged as insufficient information is processed on the left-hand side. This hybrid view of attention provides insight into the mechanisms underlying neglect dyslexia and bears on the role of attention in normal visual processing.","Number processing abilities are important for academic and personal development. The course of initial specialization of ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) sensitivity to visual number processing is crucial for the acquisition of numeric and arithmetic skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of vOTC activation across five time points in kindergarten (T1, mean age 6.60 years), middle and end of first grade (T2, 7.38 years; T3, 7.68 years), second grade (T4, 8.28 years), and fifth grade (T5, 11.40 years). A combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal EEG data of a total of 62 children (35 female) at varying familial risk for dyslexia were available to form groups of 23, 22, 27, 27, and 42 participants for each of the five time points. The children performed a target detection task which included visual presentation of single digits (DIG), false fonts (FF), and letters (LET) to derive measures for coarse (DIG vs. FF) and fine (DIG vs. LET) digit sensitive processing across development. The N1 amplitude analyses indicated coarse and fine sensitivity characterized by a stronger N1 to digits than false fonts across all five time points, and stronger N1 to digits than letters at all but the second (T2) time point. In addition, lower arithmetic skills were associated with stronger coarse N1 digit sensitivity over the left hemisphere in second grade (T4), possibly reflecting allocation of more attentional resources or stronger reliance on the verbal system in children with poorer arithmetic skills. To summarize, our results show persistent visual N1 sensitivity to digits that is already present early on in pre-school and remains stable until fifth grade. This pattern of digit sensitivity development clearly differs from the relatively sharp rise and fall of the visual N1 sensitivity to words or letters between kindergarten and middle of elementary school and suggests unique developmental trajectories for visual processing of written characters that are relevant to numeracy and literacy.","- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:** In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used to describe a specific kind of cognitive or neural processing disability affecting reading and related skills. Text A discusses ""neglect dyslexia"" which refers to a subtype characterized by inattention to one side, typical in reading activities, highlighting the impact of attentional deficits on reading processing. Text B examines developmental dyslexia in the context of numerical processing and its overlaps with reading, and tracks the developmental trajectory of dyslexia risk in children through brain imaging and cognitive testing. Despite the use of dyslexia in slightly different contexts (attention in processing in Text A and developmental aspects in Text B), the underlying reference to a learning disorder affecting reading and related cognitive processes remains constant. Therefore, the fundamental meaning of ""dyslexia"" has not shifted significantly between the contexts of both texts."
78,Dyslexia,"Reading disability (RD), or dyslexia, is a common heterogeneous syndrome with a large genetic component. Several studies have consistently found evidence for a quantitative-trait locus (QTL) within the 17 Mb (14.9 cM) that span D6S109 and D6S291 on chromosome 6p21.3-22. To characterize further linkage to the QTL, to define more accurately the location and the effect size, and to identify a peak of association, we performed Haseman-Elston and DeFries-Fulker linkage analyses, as well as transmission/disequilibrium, total-association, and variance-components analyses, on 11 quantitative reading and language phenotypes. One hundred four families with RD were genotyped with a new panel of 29 markers that spans 9 Mb of this region. Linkage results varied widely in degree of statistical significance for the different linkage tests, but multipoint analysis suggested a peak near D6S461. The average 6p QTL heritability for the 11 reading and language phenotypes was 0.27, with a maximum of 0.66 for orthographic choice. Consistent with the region of linkage described by these studies and others, there was a peak of transmission disequilibrium with a QTL centered at JA04 (chi2=9.48; empirical P=.0033; orthographic choice), and there was strong evidence for total association at this same marker (chi2=11.49; P=.0007; orthographic choice). Although the boundaries of the peak could not be precisely defined, the most likely location of the QTL is within a 4-Mb region surrounding JA04.","This study investigated whether auditory, speech perception, and phonological skills are tightly interrelated or independently contributing to reading. We assessed each of these three skills in 36 adults with a past diagnosis of dyslexia and 54 matched normal reading adults. Phonological skills were tested by the typical threefold tasks, i.e., rapid automatic naming, verbal short-term memory and phonological awareness. Dynamic auditory processing skills were assessed by means of a frequency modulation (FM) and an amplitude rise time (RT); an intensity discrimination task (ID) was included as a non-dynamic control task. Speech perception was assessed by means of sentences and words-in-noise tasks. Group analyses revealed significant group differences in auditory tasks (i.e., RT and ID) and in phonological processing measures, yet no differences were found for speech perception. In addition, performance on RT discrimination correlated with reading but this relation was mediated by phonological processing and not by speech-in-noise. Finally, inspection of the individual scores revealed that the dyslexic readers showed an increased proportion of deviant subjects on the slow-dynamic auditory and phonological tasks, yet each individual dyslexic reader does not display a clear pattern of deficiencies across the processing skills. Although our results support phonological and slow-rate dynamic auditory deficits which relate to literacy, they suggest that at the individual level, problems in reading and writing cannot be explained by the cascading auditory theory. Instead, dyslexic adults seem to vary considerably in the extent to which each of the auditory and phonological factors are expressed and interact with environmental and higher-order cognitive influences. ","- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: Describes an involvement of genetics and regional brain functionality linking to dyslexic features specifically related to reading and language phenotypes. This text outlines efforts to localize genetic variability associated with dyslexia, emphasizing the complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder but considering its substantial genetic basis.
- Text B: Focuses on exploring the multifactorial nature of dyslexia in adults by examining different skill sets such as auditory processing, phonological abilities, and speech perception. It indicates how these factors might interrelate or contribute independently to the condition and highlights the variability among individuals with dyslexia.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the use of the term ""dyslexia"" retains a strong link to reading and related cognitive challenges. Both descriptions emphasize dyslexia as a complex and heterogeneous disorder, influenced by a variety of factors, either genetic, auditory, or phonological, without deviating significantly from the core understanding of dyslexia as primarily a reading-related condition. The juxtaposition shows that while the approaches and specifics of studying dyslexia have expanded or shifted focus, the fundamental characterization of dyslexia remains consistent over time."
79,Dyslexia,"Our study compares the efficiency and acceptance of two different methods of treating dyslexia in children. The first method addresses the most commonly encountered deficits in sequential processing. It relies primarly upon the ""Kieler Lese-Rechtschreibaufbau"". The second proceeds from the child's relative resources with regard to simultaneous processing as described by Kaufman. Training materials are those prescribed by Kaufman. Normally gifted primary school third-graders were trained in two groups (n = 13 and n = 12) and achieved a mean SIF score of SW = 101 on the K-ABC. As expected, the children scored significantly lower on the SED scale (SW = 95) than on the SGD scale (SW = 105). At the beginning of the respective training program their spelling ability fell 1.5 SD below the class mean. One year of regular weekly one-hour training according to the simultaneous processing method was significantly more successful than training in sequential processing, whereas girls improved significantly more than boys regardless of the method used. Acceptance of the methods did not vary. This result requires careful consideration and should be replicated in younger samples such as first- and second-graders in the early stages of learning to read and write, and/or in children whose dyslexia is more severe than that encountered in the current sample. It underscores that determination of an adequate method of remediation entails more than the mere identification of the underlying deficits.","Study of the developmental amnesias utilizing a cognitive neuropsychological methodology has highlighted the dissociations that may occur between the development of components of memory. M.M., a new case of developmental amnesia, was identified after screening from the normal population on cognitive and memory measures. Retrospective investigation found that he was of low birthweight. M.M. had impaired semantic memory for knowledge of facts and words. There was impaired episodic memory for words and stories but intact episodic memory for visual designs and features. This forms a double dissociation with Dr S. (Temple, 1992), who had intact verbal but impaired visual episodic memory. M.M. also had impaired autobiographical episodic memory. Nevertheless, learning over repeated trials occurred, consistent with previous theorizing that learning is not simply the effect of recurrent episodic memory. Nor is it the same as establishing semantic memory, since for M.M. semantic memory is also impaired. Within reading, there was an impaired lexico-semantic system, elevated levels of homophone confusion, but intact phonological reading, consistent with surface dyslexia and raising issues about the interrelationship of the semantic system and literacy development. The results are compatible with discrete semi-independent components within memory development, whereby deficits are associated with residual normality, but there may also be an explicit relationship between the semantic memory system and both vocabulary and reading acquisition.","- Label: Unchanged

Text A discusses different methods for treating dyslexia, highlighting educational strategies (sequential vs. simultaneous processing) in improving dyslexic children’s reading and writing skills. Text B explores a case study revealing the impact of developmental amnesia on dyslexia, pointing to specific impairments in reading associated with memory issues. Despite the slightly different focus in each text, the underlying meaning and context concerning ""dyslexia"" as a reading disorder remain constant. There is a consistent emphasis on the challenges associated with reading and language processing across both texts, thereby suggesting that the semantics of ""dyslexia"" have not drifted between the two periods of study."
80,Dyslexia,"Deep dyslexia is a striking reading disorder that results from left-hemisphere brain damage and is characterized by semantic errors in reading single words aloud (e.g., reading 'spirit' as 'whisky'). Two types of explanation for this syndrome have been advanced. One is that deep dyslexia results from a residual left-hemisphere reading system that has lost the ability to pronounce a printed word without reference to meaning. The second is that deep dyslexia reflects right-hemisphere word processing. Although previous attempts to adjudicate between these hypotheses have been inconclusive, the controversy can now be addressed by mapping functional anatomy. In this study, we demonstrate that reading by two deep dyslexic patients (CJ and JG) involves normal or enhanced activity in spared left-hemisphere regions associated with naming (Broca's area and the left posterior inferior temporal cortex) and with the meanings of words (the left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and the left anterior temporal cortex). In the right-hemisphere homologues of these regions, there was inconsistent activation within the normal group and between the deep dyslexic patients. One (CJ) showed enhanced activity (relative to the normals) in the right anterior inferior temporal cortex, the other (JG) in the right Broca's area, and both in the right frontal operculum. Although these differential right-hemisphere activations may have influenced the reading behavior of the patients, their activation patterns primarily reflect semantic and phonological systems in spared regions of the left hemisphere. These results preclude an explanation of deep dyslexia in terms of purely right-hemisphere word processing.",Developmental dyslexia has been associated with reduced interhemispheric neural connectivity in children. The present study investigated functional interhemispheric connectivity in male dyslexic adults.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" continues to refer to a reading-related disorder, though viewed through different research angles and in different populations (post-injury adult deep dyslexia vs. developmental dyslexia in children and adults). Despite focusing on distinct aspects (one on brain damage-related deep dyslexia and the other on developmental dyslexia linked to neural connectivity), the fundamental understanding of ""dyslexia"" as an impairment related to reading remains consistent across the texts. Therefore, the semantic drift here is minimal, leading to the label ""Unchanged""."
81,Dyslexia,"This paper deals with intervention strategies for developmental and acquired dyslexia. In Study 1 two alternative strategies for developmental surface dyslexia (dysfunctional connection between the whole word orthographic code and the phonetic or name code) were compared. In both the initial study and replication study, a modification of the selective reminding technique was superior to a traditional multisensory technique in beginning readers, presumably because it facilitated word finding or prelexical access to a phonetic code. In Study 2 an adolescent with acquired deep dyslexia (dysfunctional connection between letter and phonemic codes) who had had his angular gyrus (site of grapheme-phoneme correspondence) surgically removed, recovered reading function after a four-month phonemic analysis training program. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of theory-based intervention strategies in children with developmental reading disorders unrelated to focal lesions and in adults with acquired reading disorders related to focal lesions.","The purpose of this study was to examine graph comprehension in college students with developmental dyslexia. We investigated how graph types (line, vertical bar, and horizontal bar graphs), graphic patterns (single and double graphic patterns), and question types (point locating and comparison questions) differentially affect graph comprehension of students with and without dyslexia. Groups were compared for (1) reaction times for answering comprehension questions based on graphed data and (2) eye gaze times for specific graph subregions (x-axis, y-axis, pattern, legend, question, and answer). Dyslexic readers were significantly slower in their graph comprehension than their peers with group differences becoming more robust with the increasing complexity of graphs and tasks. In addition, dyslexic readers' initial eye gaze viewing times for linguistic subregions (question and answer) and total viewing times for both linguistic (question and answer) and nonlinguistic (pattern) subregions were significantly longer than their control peers' times. In spite of using elementary-level paragraphs for comprehension and simple graph forms, young adults with dyslexia needed more time to process linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. These findings are discussed relative to theories proposed to address fundamental processing deficits in individuals with dyslexia.","###Answer:
- **Target word:** Dyslexia
- **Text A:** Discusses dyslexia primarily in terms of acquired neurological dysfunctions, emphasizing different syndromes like developmental surface dyslexia and acquired deep dyslexia. The text focuses on the neurological and cognitive anomalies contributing to dyslexia (caused either by developmental issues or by brain injuries) and explores specific intervention strategies that aid in mitigating these deficits.
- **Text B:** Similarly studies developmental dyslexia but shifts focus more overtly onto how these cognitive challenges manifest in practical tasks like graph comprehension among college students. It includes investigations into the impact of various complexities in graphical representations on dyslexic individuals' comprehension abilities, as well as the cognitive processing speeds and patterns of attention, revealing broader impacts of dyslexia on academic and cognitive functions in a more applied setting.

- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:** In both texts, while the contexts of exploring dyslexia slightly differ (neurological vs. academic implications), the core understanding and depiction of dyslexia as a complex cognitive and neurological developmental condition remain consistent. Both texts emphasize the challenges individuals with dyslexia face, whether in acquiring reading abilities due to disrupted neurological pathways or in processing complex visual information. The underlying portrayal of dyslexia as a broader cognitive impairment affecting various aspects of learning and information processing is clear in both instances, indicating that the semantic core of the term 'dyslexia' remains stable over time."
82,Dyslexia,"Reviews of the dyslexia literature often seem to suggest that children with dyslexia perform at a lower level on almost any task. Richards et al. (Dyslexia 2002; 8: 1-8) note the importance of being able to demonstrate dissociations between tasks. However, increasingly elegant experiments, in which dissociations are found, almost inevitably find that the performance of children with dyslexia is lower as tasks become more difficult! By looking for deficits in dyslexia, could we be barking up the wrong tree? A methodological approach for circumventing this potential problem is discussed.","A theoretical framework suggests that developmental dyslexia is characterized by abnormalities in brain structures underlying the procedural learning and memory systems while the declarative learning and memory systems are presumed to remain intact or even enhanced (Procedural Deficit Hypothesis). This notion has been supported by a substantial body of research, which focused on each system independently. However, less attention has been paid to interactions between these memory systems which may provide insights as to learning situations and conditions in which learning in dyslexia can be improved. The current study was undertaken to examine these important but unresolved issues. To this end, probabilistic reinforcement learning and episodic memory tasks were examined in participants with dyslexia and neurotypicals simultaneously within a single task. Feedback timing presentation was manipulated, building on prior research indicating that delaying feedback timing shifts striatal-based probabilistic learning, to become more hippocampal-dependent. It was hypothesized that if the procedural learning and memory systems are impaired in dyslexia, performance will be impaired under conditions that encourage procedural memory engagement (immediate feedback trials) but not under conditions that promote declarative memory processing (long delayed feedback trials). It was also predicted that the ability to incidentally acquire episodic information would be preserved in dyslexia. The results supported these predictions. Participants with dyslexia were impaired in probabilistic learning of cue-outcome associations compared to neurotypicals in an immediate feedback condition, but not when feedback on choices was presented after a long delay. Furthermore, participants with dyslexia demonstrated similar performance to neurotypicals in a task requiring incidental episodic memory formation. These findings attest to a dissociation between procedural-based and declarative-based learning in developmental dyslexia within a single task, a finding that adds discriminative validity to the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis. Just as important, the present findings suggest that training conditions designed to shift the load from midbrain/striatal systems to declarative memory mechanisms have the potential to compensate for impaired learning in developmental dyslexia.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dyslexia"" is generally discussed in terms of children's performance on tasks and refers to broad learning difficulties. The focus is on the challenges and deficits associated with dyslexia, particularly in handling complex tasks. It also hints at possible methodological approaches to studying dyslexia differently. On the other hand, Text B delves into the neurological underpinnings and differentiates between types of memory and learning systems (procedural vs. declarative) affected by dyslexia. It introduces specific hypotheses like the ""Procedural Deficit Hypothesis"" and discusses dyslexia in terms of brain function and structure, highlighting a more nuanced understanding of the condition that goes beyond simple task performance. The shift from a behavioral to a more precise neurobiological and memory systems perspective indicates a significant semantic drift in the understanding and discussion of dyslexia over time."
83,Dyslexia,"Deep dyslexia evolved into phonological dyslexia in one patient. Semantic errors resolved while phonological and derivational errors persisted in reading. Nonword reading improved but remained inferior to word reading. Despite a residual semantic deficit naming improved. The Simultaneous Activation Hypothesis explains recovery from deep to phonological dyslexia and the continued dissociation between reading and naming errors. Partial recovery to all three reading routes increased constraints for word selection at the phonological output lexicon (POL) improving word reading. With recovery, the POL receives additional supportive information from the partially recovered direct oral reading route and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (GPC) eliminating semantic errors in oral reading. Nonword reading also improved because of partial recovery to all three routes. Semantic errors in naming persisted because additional constraints were unavailable at the POL to activate a phonological entry. Phonological and derivational errors were more frequent in reading than in naming the result of incomplete GPC recovery. Residual nonword reading deficits resulted from incomplete GPC recovery, indicated by the persistence of neologisms in nonwords.

84,Dyslexia,"Developmental dyslexia was until recently considered to belong solely in the domain of educational psychology. With the advent of better theories on language and reading, and better methods for assessing the structure and function of living human brains and for determining genetic transmission, dyslexia is now poised to become a focal concern of cognitive neuroscience, neurology, and genetic research. Still unresolved are questions relating to how much a reading disability represents a normal variation or a separate pathological entity, and whether the cognitive disorder is primarily cognitive, or secondary to a disorder in early perception. Recent findings from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and genetics research are reviewed. (This review is an updated version of a review first published in Current Opinion In Neurology and Neurosurgery 1992, 5:71-76.)","Research findings and positions concerning the nature of the dyslexia construct are currently diverse and increasingly complex. The ability of assessor practitioners to operationalize such knowledge and categorically diagnose dyslexia in any reliable and consistent way is being questioned. This study aimed to explore the way in which diverse and complex research findings are operationalized in the dyslexia diagnostic assessment of UK higher education students. The perspectives of 118 professional assessors of dyslexia working within the sector were collected using a questionnaire and some interviews. Data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, as appropriate, and then integrated. The results confirmed critics' concerns about the consistency and reliability of the construct as currently diagnosed within the higher education context. Key controversial aspects of practice that emerged included the contextualized interpretation of literacy difficulties, a general commitment to discrepancy concepts, scepticism about the face validity of prescribed psychometric tests, and a related reliance on professional observation and experience above test results.

85,Dyslexia,"There is evolving evidence that developmental dyslexia is associated with anomalous cerebral morphology in the bilateral frontal and left temporoparietal regions. This study examined the morphology of the corpus callosum, as possible deviations in other important structures are poorly understood in this behaviorally diagnosed syndrome.","The authors previously identified a haplotype on chromosome 6p22 defined by three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that was associated with dyslexia (reading disability) in two independent samples of families that included at least one sibling with severe reading impairment. The authors also showed that this haplotype is associated with a reduction in expression of the KIAA0319 gene. In addition, a completely independent study detected an association between KIAA0319 markers and reading disability. In the current study, the authors tested whether the KIAA0319 gene influences reading skills in the general population, rather than having an effect restricted to reading disability.","- Label: Unchanged

Thus, the fundamental understanding and application of the term ""dyslexia"" as a reading disability remain unchanged between the two texts."
86,Dyslexia,"It has been proposed that developmental dyslexia is associated with a deficit in the magnocellular pathway of the visual system. Other research focuses upon the heterogeneous nature of developmental dyslexia, and evidence that subgroups of dyslexia may be identified based on selective deficits in specific component reading skills. This study tested the hypothesis that visual processing deficits may be present in different subgroups of developmental dyslexia by comparing the visual contrast sensitivity of three subgroups of dyslexic children (phonological, surface and mixed) and controls. The stimulus designed to measure magnocellular visual function was a low spatial frequency Gaussian blob, flickered sinusoidally at a temporal frequency of 8.33 Hz. The control stimulus, designed to measure parvocellular visual function, was a relatively high spatial frequency Gaussian windowed grating (8 c/deg) slowly ramped on and off. There were no significant differences between the groups of dyslexic and control children in contrast sensitivity to either stimulus. The findings do not support the existence of a magnocellular system deficit in dyslexia.","The reading deficit for people with dyslexia is typically associated with linguistic, memory, and perceptual-discrimination difficulties, whose relation to reading impairment is disputed. We proposed that automatic detection and usage of serial sound regularities for individuals with dyslexia is impaired (anchoring deficit hypothesis), leading to the formation of less reliable sound predictions. Agus, Carrión-Castillo, Pressnitzer, and Ramus, (2014) reported seemingly contradictory evidence by showing similar performance by participants with and without dyslexia in a demanding auditory task that contained task-relevant regularities. To carefully assess the sensitivity of participants with dyslexia to regularities of this task, we replicated their study.","###Answer:

87,Dyslexia,"Developmental dyslexia has been associated with both abnormal hemispheric symmetry of the planum temporale (PT) and a deficit in the magnocellular visual pathway. We examined the relationship between these two abnormalities.

Dyslexic subjects did not deviate from normal leftward PT asymmetry, but both groups became less left-lateralized with methods that excluded sulcul tissue.

- Reason: In both texts, ""dyslexia"" is consistently referred to as a condition affecting the neurological processing of written and spoken language. While Text A focuses on the neural and anatomical correlates of dyslexia, such as hemispheric symmetry and visual pathway deficits, Text B explores the functional and perceptual consequences of dyslexia, particularly regarding speech sound discrimination. Despite these differences in focus, the fundamental conceptualization of dyslexia as a disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and related cognitive processes remains unchanged between the texts. Both texts maintain the same underlying definition and understanding of the disorder, concentrating on its neurodevelopmental aspects and implications for literacy and language processing."
88,Dyslexia,"This article addresses the neuroimaging (CT/MRI), electrophysiological (ERP/EEG), and postmortem evidence as to the neurological basis of dyslexia and discusses why these sources of evidence yield what appear to be inconsistent findings. It is concluded that what appear to be inconsistencies may relate in part to limitations of these investigative technologies. Then, important correlates of reading ability and disability are discussed in a developmental-neuropsychological context, and recommendations are made for research serving to further integrate cognitive and neurological paradigms. Of particular importance, inconsistencies between the results revealed through neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and postmortem studies, on the one hand, and neurolinguistic theory, on the other, must be addressed. Articulating the neurometabolic role-and particularly the nature of the behavioral correlates of the thalamus, supplementary motor area, and frontal cortex-in regard to bihemispheric mechanisms related to reading in developmental dyslexia should be a priority in future research.","Acquired spatial dyslexia is a reading disorder frequently occurring after left or right posterior brain lesions. This article describes several types of spatial dyslexia with an attentional approach. After right posterior lesions, patients show left neglect dyslexia with errors on the left side of text, words, and non-words. The deficit is frequently associated with left unilateral spatial neglect. Severe left neglect dyslexia can be detected with unlimited exposure duration of words or non-words. Minor neglect dyslexia is detected with brief presentation of bilateral words, one in the left and one in the right visual field (phenomenon of contralesional extinction). Neglect dyslexia can be explained as a difficulty in orienting attention to the left side of verbal stimuli. With left posterior lesions, spatial dyslexia is also frequent but multiform. Right neglect dyslexia is frequent, but right unilateral spatial neglect is rare. Attentional dyslexia represents difficulty in selecting a stimulus, letter or word among other similar stimuli; it is a deficit of attentional selection, and the left hemisphere plays a crucial role in selection. Two other types of spatial dyslexia can be found after left posterior lesions: paradoxical ipsilesional extinction and stimulus-centred neglect dyslexia. Disconnections between left or right parietal attentional areas and the left temporal visual word form area could explain these deficits. Overall, a model of attention dissociating modulation, selection control, and selection positioning can help in understanding these reading disorders.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: The text discusses dyslexia primarily from a neuroscientific perspective, exploring inconsistencies in research findings regarding neuroimaging, electrophysiological evidence, and postmortem studies. It talks about the significance of integrating cognitive and neurological paradigms to better comprehend dyslexia, particularly in developmental contexts.
- Text B: This passage deals with various manifestations and types of spatial dyslexia associated with brain lesions, differentiating between effects following left or right posterior lesions. It elaborates on how these conditions influence reading abilities, focusing on attention-related deficits in recognizing and processing spatial orientation of textual content.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The focus and implications of the term ""dyslexia"" have shifted between the two texts. Text A presents dyslexia in terms of a broader neurological context related to developmental issues and the integration of cognitive studies, while Text B is more clinically specific, delving into the nuances of spatial dyslexia induced by brain injuries, focusing on neuroanatomical deficits and attendant attentional dysfunctions. This shift from a generalized developmental disorder to detailed descriptions of type-specific impairments based on lesion locations indicates a broadening and specification in the understanding and clinical framing of dyslexia, demonstrating a semantic drift in its applied context."
89,Dyslexia,"Disorders of reading are frequently encountered in patients with acquired cerebral lesions. Investigations in the past few decades have improved our understanding of these disorders. In this article we review the peripheral dyslexias, including neglect dyslexia, attentional dyslexia, and pure alexia (or alexia without agraphia), as well as the ""central"" dyslexias, including deep, surface, and phonological dyslexia. Current accounts of acquired dyslexia are also discussed. Finally, we briefly describe the reading tasks that serve to differentiate the different reading disorders.","Reading disorder is a recognized feature in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Surface dyslexia, characterized by regularization errors, is typically seen in the English-speaking semantic variant of PPA (svPPA). However, dyslexic characteristics of other languages, particularly logographical languages such as Chinese, remain sparse in the literature. This study aims to characterize and describe the dyslexic pattern in this group of patients by comparing an English-speaking svPPA group with a Chinese-speaking svPPA group. The authors hypothesized that Chinese-speaking individuals with svPPA would likely commit fewer surface dyslexic errors. By accessing the database of Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center of the United States, the authors identified three Chinese-speaking and 18 English-speaking patients with svPPA, respectively, for comparison. The results suggest that, instead of surface dyslexia, svPPA in Chinese-speaking individuals is characterized by a profound deep dyslexic error. Based on current evidence suggesting the role of the temporal pole as a semantic convergence center, the authors conclude that this region also mediates and converges lexical-semantic significance in logographical languages.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" consistently refers to disorders related to reading. Text A discusses various subtypes of acquired dyslexia and considers multiple forms, while Text B focuses on the manifestations of dyslexia in different languages and language groups, particularly in the context of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Despite some differences in specific details and emphasis on particular aspects or subtypes of dyslexia, the fundamental meaning of the term as a reading disorder remains consistent across both texts. Thus, there has been no significant semantic drift in the meaning of ""dyslexia"" over the period spanning the years of these texts."

- Reason: Both texts discuss dyslexia within an academic or research framework, focusing on theoretical and conceptual aspects rather than changing the fundamental understanding of what dyslexia represents (a learning disability involving reading and related language-based processing skills). Text A provides general information about a meeting held to discuss advances in dyslexia, suggesting it's a gathering focused on research and theory, though precise content is not detailed. Text B specifically critiques and elaborates on concepts within the study of dyslexia, namely phonology, hinting at its complexity and challenges in definition over time, but still within the scope of how dyslexia relates to cognitive and perceptual functions.

91,Dyslexia,"Replication of linkage results for complex traits has been exceedingly difficult, owing in part to the inability to measure the precise underlying phenotype, small sample sizes, genetic heterogeneity, and statistical methods employed in analysis. Often, in any particular study, multiple correlated traits have been collected, yet these have been analyzed independently or, at most, in bivariate analyses. Theoretical arguments suggest that full multivariate analysis of all available traits should offer more power to detect linkage; however, this has not yet been evaluated on a genomewide scale. Here, we conduct multivariate genomewide analyses of quantitative-trait loci that influence reading- and language-related measures in families affected with developmental dyslexia. The results of these analyses are substantially clearer than those of previous univariate analyses of the same data set, helping to resolve a number of key issues. These outcomes highlight the relevance of multivariate analysis for complex disorders for dissection of linkage results in correlated traits. The approach employed here may aid positional cloning of susceptibility genes in a wide spectrum of complex traits.","Reading acquisition is enabled by deep changes in the brain's visual system and language areas, and in the links subtending their collaboration. Disruption of those plastic processes commonly results in developmental dyslexia. However, atypical development of reading mechanisms may occasionally result in ticker-tape synesthesia (TTS), a condition described by Francis Galton in 1883 wherein individuals ""see mentally in print every word that is uttered (…) as from a long imaginary strip of paper"". While reading is the bottom-up translation of letters into speech, TTS may be viewed as its opposite, the top-down translation of speech into internally visualized letters. In a series of functional MRI experiments, we studied MK, a man with TTS. We showed that a set of left-hemispheric areas were more active in MK than in controls during the perception of normal than reversed speech, including frontoparietal areas involved in speech processing, and the Visual Word Form Area, an occipitotemporal region subtending orthography. Those areas were identical to those involved in reading, supporting the construal of TTS as upended reading. Using dynamic causal modeling, we further showed that, parallel to reading, TTS induced by spoken words and pseudowords relied on top-down flow of information along distinct lexical and phonological routes, involving the middle temporal and supramarginal gyri, respectively. Future studies of TTS should shed new light on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of reading acquisition, their variability and their disorders.","###Answer:

Both texts focus on evaluating the effects and manifestations of dyslexia in different contexts (traffic sign recognition in adults and second language acquisition in children), but the underlying definition and implications of dyslexia as a learning disorder remain consistent.

94,Dyslexia,"Visual factors in specific learning difficulties (SpLD) are reviewed. People with SpLD fail to achieve at a level that is commensurate with their intelligence. The commonest SpLD is dyslexia, which usually results from phonological processing/decoding deficits. Additionally, there are several optometric correlates of SpLD which may, in some cases, contribute to the learning difficulty. These correlates include binocular instability and a low amplitude of accommodation. Some people with reading difficulties and perceptual distortions/eyestrain can be helped by individually prescribed coloured filters. A visual processing anomaly is also often present in the form of a deficit of the transient visual system. The role of the optometrist is discussed.","Previous studies showed that the lateral masking of a fast-moving low spatial frequency (SF) target was strong when exerted by static flankers of lower or equal to the target SF and absent when flankers' SF was higher than the target's one. These masking and unmasking effects have been interpreted as due to Magnocellular-Magnocellular (M-M) inhibition and Parvocellular-on-Magnocellular (P-M) disinhibitory coactivation, respectively. Based on the hypothesis that the balance between the two systems is perturbed in Developmental Dyslexia (DD), we asked whether dyslexic children (DDs) behaved differently than Typically Developing children (TDs) in conditions of lateral masking. DDs and TDs performed a motion discrimination task, of a .5c/deg Gabor target moving at 16 deg/sec, either isolated or flanked by static Gabors with a SF of .125, .5 or 2 c/deg (Experiment 1). As a control, they also performed a contrast detection task of a static target, either isolated or flanked (Experiment 2). DDs did not perform any different from TDs with either a static target or an isolated moving target of low spatial frequency, thus suggesting efficient feedforward Magnocellular (M) and Parvocellular (P) processing. Also, DDs showed similar contrast thresholds to TDs in the M-M inhibition condition. Conversely, DDs did not recover from lateral masking in the M-P coactivation condition. In addition, their performance in this condition negatively correlated with non-words accuracy, supporting the suggestion that an inefficient Magno-Parvo coactivation may possibly be associated to both higher visual suppression and reduced perceptual stability during reading.","###Answer:

- Reason: The fundamental concept of dyslexia remains related to learning difficulties, especially connected to reading. However, in the earlier text, dyslexia is discussed more holistically as a part of broader learning difficulties aligned with general visual processing and even possibly addressable via approaches like colored filters. In contrast, the later text illustrates a narrowed focus and a more neuroscientific approach analyzing specific visual processing deficits directly tied into reading difficulties in dyslexic individuals. This signifies a shift in understanding from a broader educational and optometric perspective to a more finely tuned neuroscience and perceptual processing emphasis.

95,Dyslexia,"A consecutive cohort of 112 children, 42 girls and 70 boys, aged 5-17 years, receiving child psychiatric inpatient care, was investigated regarding the probability of a complex background of concomitant biological and social factors. Most of the subjects showed maladjustment and depressive states, school problems, problems with peers, psychosomatic complaints and anxiety. A very high rate of factors indicating neurodevelopmental dysfunctions was found particularly in boys, who exhibited developmental delay, dyslexia, heredity for dyslexia, and a slow complex reaction time (CRT) - suggesting slow cognitive processing - considered an impairment in itself. Further, many children obtained errors on the CRT task, indicating attention deficit and deterioration during the test, pointing toward exhaustion. The social background displayed frequent problems such as broken homes, care outside the biological home, and disordered and/or abusing parents. The biological and social factors created a complex web, predisposing the child to primary, secondary and/or comorbidity problems, and leading to an interactive process reducing the child's psychosocial capacity and competence. A pattern was developed of an impaired child, living in an inadequate/insufficient family milieu in a modern society, with increasing demands on children.","Recently, a general implicit sequence learning deficit was proposed as an underlying cause of dyslexia.

The second goal of the study was to explore the role of attentional functioning in implicit and explicit learning tasks.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dyslexia"" maintains its central focus on a specific type of learning disability predominantly affecting the ability to read and spell words, reflecting a neurodevelopmental disorder. Text A talks about children in a psychiatric setting exhibiting various problems including ""dyslexia,"" indicating it in context as a condition impairing their cognitive processing related to reading and potentially other academic skills. Text B discusses a study exploring an underlying cause of dyslexia related to deficits in implicit sequence learning, which is also a cognitive processing issue impacting how people with dyslexia learn and process information.

Both texts, although exploring different dimensions and potential causes or associations (neurodevelopmental indicators and cognitive deficits in sequence learning), revolve around the fundamental meaning of dyslexia as a learning disorder with cognitive underpinnings.

Hence, the semantic drift for ""dyslexia"" between the periods covered by Text A and Text B remains unchanged."
96,Dyslexia,"Recent studies have reported an attentional feedback that highlights neural responses as early along the visual pathway as the primary visual cortex. Such filtering would help in reducing informational overload and in performing serial visual search by directing attention to individual locations in the visual field. The magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) subdivisions are two of the major parallel pathways in primate vision that originate in the retina and carry distinctly different types of information. The M pathway, characterized by its high sensitivity to movement and to low contrast stimuli, forms the predominant visual input into the dorsal, parietal stream in the neocortex. The P inputs, characterized by their colour selectivity and higher spatial resolution, are channeled mainly into the ventral, temporal stream. It is proposed that the attentional spotlight originates in the dorsal stream and helps in serially searching the field for conjunction of the relevant target features in the temporal stream, effectively performing a gating function on all visual inputs. This model predicts that a defect limited to the magnocellular or the dorsal pathway can lead to widespread deficits in cognitive abilities, including those functions that are largely based on parvocellular information. For example, the model provides a neural mechanism linking a peripheral defect in the magnocellular pathway to the reading disabilities in dyslexia. Even though there has been strong evidence for a magnocellular deficit in dyslexia, the paradox has been that the cognitive disability seems to be related to P pathway function. The scheme proposed here shows how M input may be vital for controlling sequential attention during reading.","We investigated reading skills in individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy and in readers with developmental dyslexia to understand diverse characteristics contributing to reading difficulty. Although dyslexia is a developmental disorder, left hemispherectomy requires that patients (re)establish the language process needed to perform the language-based tasks in the nondominant (right) hemisphere to become readers.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dyslexia"" is used to describe a condition related to difficulties in reading and associated cognitive processes, which may stem from differences or impairments in brain functions. Text A links dyslexia to specific neural pathways and their interactions with cognitive abilities in reading, suggesting a detailed neurological basis for the condition. Text B discusses the implications of developmental dyslexia alongside neurological adaptability in patients undergoing significant brain surgery, with a focus on reading abilities. Despite different contexts and specifics in research focus, the essential meaning of ""dyslexia"" as a learning disability affecting reading remains consistent between the texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the term ""dyslexia"" across the two time periods and contexts presented."
97,Dyslexia,"For nearly 100 years, the underlying cause of dyslexia has been a matter of much debate, with widely varying viewpoints that have ranged from considering dyslexia as largely a learning disability to claims that it is essentially a perceptual defect occurring early along the visual pathway. This paper reviews some of this literature with particular reference to the studies that have implicated a defect in the afferent visual pathways in the aetiology of the disorder, then goes on to outline a neural theory of how functionally distinct parallel pathways in vision interact with each other in the process of reading and suggests how a defect in these pathways can lead to reading difficulties. Central to the proposed scheme is the suggestion that a fast-track pathway, arising from the magnocellular cells in the retina and acting through an attentional mechanism, has a gating function in spotlighting the individual letters of a text in a sequential fashion. That such gating occurs at the level of the primary visual cortex is supported by recent physiological evidence concerning attentional mechanisms.","Although there have been frequent clinical reports about sleep disturbances in children with learning disabilities, no data are available about the prevalence of sleep disturbances in children with developmental dyslexia (DD). This study evaluated sleep disturbances in children with DD referred to a hospital clinic and compared their scores with healthy controls.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dyslexia
- Text A: This text discusses dyslexia primarily from a neurological and visual processing perspective, positing it as a perceptual defect influenced by the early visual pathway and neural processing in reading.
- Text B: This text refers to dyslexia in a broader context of developmental disorders, particularly focusing on its association with sleep disturbances, thus approaching it from a clinical perspective relating to broader developmental concerns and quality of life issues in affected children.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the focus on dyslexia is heavily tied to specific neural and perceptual pathways impacting reading, with a strong emphasis on visual processing defects as causative factors. In Text B, dyslexia is treated more holistically as part of a spectrum of developmental issues, also involving sleep disturbances, thus broadening its conceptualization beyond mere reading or visual processing troubles. This reflects a shift from a specific neurological perspective to a more integrated developmental and clinical perspective, indicating a significant semantic drift in the contextual application and understanding of dyslexia."
98,Dyslexia,"Comparisons of the developmental pathways of the first 5 years of life for children with (N = 107) and without (N = 93) familial risk for dyslexia observed in the Jyväskylä Longitudinal study of Dyslexia are reviewed. The earliest differences between groups were found at the ages of a few days and at 6 months in brain event-related potential responses to speech sounds and in head-turn responses (at 6 months), conditioned to reflect categorical perception of speech stimuli. The development of vocalization and motor behavior, based on parental report of the time of reaching significant milestones, or the growth of vocabulary (using the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories) failed to reveal differences before age 2. Similarly, no group differences were found in cognitive and language development assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Reynell Developmental Language Scales before age 2.5. The earliest language measure that showed lower scores among the at-risk group was maximum sentence length at age 2. Early gross motor development had higher correlation to later language skills among the at-risk group rather than the control children. The most consistent predictor of differential development between groups was the onset of talking. Children who were identified as late talkers at age 2 were still delayed at the age 3.5 in most features of language-related skills-but only if they belonged to the group at familial risk for dyslexia. Several phonological and naming measures known to correlate with reading from preschool age differentiated the groups consistently from age 3.5. Our findings imply that a marked proportion of children at familial risk for dyslexia follow atypical neurodevelopmental paths. The signs listed previously comprise a pool of candidates for early predictors and precursors of dyslexia, which await validation.","This article analyzes, from the standpoint of reception studies and transnational history, the different ways Lev S. Vygotsky's published work in Spanish, English, and Russian was read, discussed, and used in Argentina from 1935 to 1974. This ""early"" reception primarily involved 2 groups: writers affiliated with the Argentine Communist Party, and individuals without political affiliations who engaged in discussion with Communists. The article argues that Communism, as a cultural tradition and political organization, played a key role in the reception and diffusion of Vygotsky's work. The ideas of the Soviet psychologist were applied in 3 different areas: the psychophysiological theorizing of consciousness, the diagnosis and treatment of dyslexia, and the study of psychiatric phenomena. This article partially reconstructs the circulation of Soviet psychology in Argentina in order to provide a critical approach regarding the inclusion of certain figures in the psychological canon, the methods by which these authors have been researched in the past, the means that enable the circulation of psychological knowledge, and the ways in which the political and intellectual milieu of reception define the productivity and relevance of an author. (PsycINFO Database Record","###Answer:
- Target word: **Dyslexia**
- Text A: The text discusses the neurodevelopmental paths of children at familial risk for dyslexia through various early life stages and attempts to identify early predictors and precursors of dyslexia based on neuroscientific and developmental observations.
- Text B: The text reviews the historical and cultural reception of research and theories in psychology, including dyslexia, within different political contexts in Argentina. It mentions dyslexia in association with broader psychological and educational practices influenced by political ideologies and cultural traditions.

- Label: **Unchanged**
- Reason: In both texts, the term dyslexia is used in reference to its established meaning related to a specific learning disability that affects individuals' abilities in reading and related language-based processing skills. Despite the different focus of each text (neurodevelopmental aspects in Text A versus historical and cultural perspectives in Text B), the core meaning pertaining to the learning disorder itself remains consistent across both periods. Hence, the word ""dyslexia"" has not undergone significant semantic drift in terms of its fundamental denotation in medical and psychological lexicons, as evidenced across the two texts.
"
99,Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is a disability in acquiring reading and spelling skills that is independent of general intelligence and educational opportunity, and is highly heritable. It is known that dyslexia often co-occurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the 7-repeat allele of the 48-bp tandem repeat in exon 3 of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) has been implicated in ADHD. We, therefore, investigated DRD4 as a candidate gene for dyslexia by testing for linkage and association with 14 markers at and around the DRD4 locus on chromosome 11p15.5. Using 100 families having at least two siblings affected with dyslexia, model-free linkage analysis revealed evidence for linkage to the DRD4-exon 3 repeat (two-point MFLOD = 2.27, P = 0.001) and to HRAS located just proximal to DRD4 (two-point MFLOD = 2.68, P = 0.0004). Evidence for linkage was maximal between DRD4 and HRAS (three-point MFLOD = 3.57, P = 0.00005). However, linkage disequilibrium analysis showed no significant evidence for association between dyslexia and DRD4 or HRAS. In particular, dyslexic subjects showed no significant increase of the DRD4 7-repeat allele associated with ADHD. It is possible that other DRD4 variants, not in strong linkage disequilibrium with the exon 3 repeat polymorphism, or alternatively, another gene very closely linked to DRD4, may influence susceptibility to dyslexia.",The purpose of this study is to investigate word learning in children with dyslexia to ascertain their strengths and weaknesses during the configuration stage of word learning.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the description of ""dyslexia"" remains principally focused on its aspects related to learning abilities, particularly in the context of literacy such as reading and spelling. Text A explores the genetic links and co-occurrence with ADHD in dyslexic individuals, emphasizing its role as a learning disorder that affects certain cognitive functions related to words and language. Text B investigates word learning in dyslexic children, again highlighting the learning challenges faced by individuals with this disability. Thus, the primary understanding of dyslexia as a specific learning disability related to reading and spelling skills remains consistent across the texts, showing no significant shift in meaning or context."
0,Asperger,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders encompassing Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Semantic-Pragmatic disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Auditory integration therapy (AIT) was developed as a technique for improving abnormal sound sensitivity in individuals with behavioural disorders including autism. Other sound therapies bearing similarities to AIT include the Tomatis Method and Samonas Sound Therapy.","Although a number of advanced theory of mind tasks have been developed, there is a dearth of information on whether performances on different tasks are associated. The present study examined the performance of 21 children and adolescents with diagnoses of Asperger syndrome (AS) and 20 typically developing controls on three advanced theory of mind tasks: The Eyes Task, the Strange Stories, and the Stories from Everyday Life. The participants in the clinical group demonstrated lower performance than the controls on all the three tasks. The pattern of findings, however, indicates that these tasks may share different information-processing requirements in addition to tapping different mentalizing abilities.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers specifically to Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum. Text A lists it among various disorders within autism spectrum disorders such as Autistic Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Text B discusses performance-related studies involving individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome in cognitive tasks related to theory of mind. In both instances, ""Asperger"" is consistently used to refer to the same condition, maintaining a similar definition and connotation related to its classification as a part of the autism spectrum disorders. There is no indication of a shift in meaning or application of the term between the two texts, despite the different focus on how the term is discussed (Text A more broadly in the context of classification, Text B in a psychological study context)."
1,Asperger,"Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is characterized by peculiar psycho-behavioral patterns. Youths with PDD who commit delinquent acts often exhibit strange behavior beyond ordinary comprehension. In order to fully understand and identify PDD it is important to take a comprehensive psychosocial history. Here we report on a 19-year-old delinquent male from a juvenile detention home who was exhibiting PDD. Both the psycho-behavioral patterns of the subject and the dysfunctional family background were key factors in this case. The subject persistently stalked and harassed an elementary school girl despite repeated intervention by police and the girl's parents to stop doing so. This behavior culminated in the subject being arrested and put on probation. While on probation his behavior continued, leading to his arrest and confinement to a correctional facility for juveniles with medical needs. Several features that included sustained impairment in social interaction and repetitive patterns of behavior that are often identified in delinquents with PDD were found to exist in the subject and he was diagnosed with PDD (probably Asperger's disease). The subject presented with a superficial understanding of the consequences his behavior had on others and for himself. Also, impaired family function was found to be a major contributing factor to his delinquency. Together theses factors hindered the subject from acquiring appropriate social skills. The major responsibility for providing care and support of an individual with PDD is within the family. Failure of the family to undertake such responsibilities can lead to ineffective treatment even after a specialist has identified the disorder. Given the slow decline of the nuclear family in Japan, it is important to understand the role of the family in caring for a child with PDD. Also, public recognition of PDD and social support for individuals with the disorder is important.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Irritability related to ASD has been treated with antipsychotics. Aripiprazole, a third generation atypical antipsychotic, is a relatively new drug that has a unique mechanism of action different from other antipsychotics.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""Asperger"" appears in a context indicating the diagnosis of a specific form of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), characterized by certain behavioral patterns and social impairments, which might relate to delinquent behavior due to these impairments. Here, ""Asperger"" is classified under a probable diagnosis suggesting a label for the individual behavioral exhibition within a criminal context.

  In Text B, however, ""Asperger's Disorder"" is clearly enveloped within a broader classification called Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This reflects a more updated and inclusive understanding, distinguishing it not just as a stand-alone disorder but as part of a spectrum, indicating variability in severity and manifestations. The reference to treatment involving antipsychotics such as Aripiprazole also suggests a shift towards understanding and managing symptoms pharmaceutically, focusing more broadly on ASD-associated irritabilities and less on the specific social or behavioral traits tied uniquely to Asperger's. This shift signifies a broader, more inclusive, and possibly less stigmatizing understanding of Asperger's within the domain of ASD, highlighting a significant change in perception and clinical approach over the decades."
2,Asperger,"The study examined developmental changes in autistic symptoms retrospectively in a sample of 28 verbal children and adolescents with autism. Individuals with Asperger syndrome, PDD-NOS, and related medical conditions were not included in the study. We compared autistic symptoms present at the retrospective assessment and during the 4- to 5-year age period using the ADI-R. Our findings revealed a significant improvement in the three domains relevant for the diagnosis of autism, independent of age or IQ level. Improvement occurred in more symptoms from the social than the communication domain, and for more symptoms from the latter than the restricted interest and repetitive behavior domains. The finding that improvement was not linked to level of functioning and was found in individuals still positive for a diagnosis of autism suggests that improvement belongs to the 'natural history' of the handicap.","According to the DSM-IV, the autism diagnosis always has priority over the Asperger syndrome (AS). If a patient meets the criteria for autism, the diagnosis of AS is ruled out. However, since Lona Wing reexamined Asperger's original description and noted the similarities between autism and AS, whether autism, especially high-functioning autism (HFA), and AS were the same disorder or not has been controversial. There is no reason why we distinguish HFA from AS with regard to general intervention and social and communication skill training. From a view point of clinical features, cognitive neurophychology and neurobiology, the differentiation between HFA and AS is not clear. There are few reports on outcome in HFA and AS. Whereas, it is suggested that HFA and AS may be different in social problems such as suicide attempt. Researches on the differentiation between HFA and AS are to be needed in future.","###Answer:

- Reason: Despite slight contextual differences in both texts concerning the relationship and differentiation between autism, High-Functioning Autism (HFA), and Asperger syndrome (AS), the core semantic association and conceptual understanding of ""Asperger"" as a form of Autism Spectrum Disorder largely remains the same. Both texts discuss Asperger syndrome as closely linked with the autism spectrum, highlighting debates about its classification but not altering its fundamental definition or perception significantly. Thus, the core meaning of ""Asperger"" has not undergone a significant semantic shift or drift between the two periods presented in the texts."
3,Asperger,"It has been hypothesized that social developmental disorders (SDD) like autism, Asperger's disorder and the social-emotional processing disorder may be associated with prosopagnosic-like deficits in face recognition. We studied the ability to recognize famous faces in 24 adults with a variety of SDD diagnoses. We also measured their ability to discriminate changes in internal facial configuration, a perceptual function that is important in face recognition, and their imagery for famous faces, an index of their facial memory stores. We contrasted their performance with both healthy subjects and prosopagnosic patients. We also performed a cluster analysis of the SDD patients. One group of eight SDD subjects performed normally on all tests of face perception and recognition. The other 16 subjects were impaired in recognition, though most were better than prosopagnosic patients. One impaired SDD subgroup had poor perception of facial structure but relatively preserved imagery, resembling prosopagnosic patients with medial occipitotemporal lesions. Another subgroup had better perception than imagery, resembling one prosopagnosic with bilateral anterior temporal lesions. Overall, SDD subgroup membership by face recognition did not correlate with a particular SDD diagnosis or subjective ratings of social impairment. We conclude that the social disturbance in SDD does not invariably lead to impaired face recognition. Abnormal face recognition in some SDD subjects is related to impaired perception of facial structure in a manner suggestive of occipitotemporal dysfunction. Heterogeneity in the perceptual processing of faces may imply pathogenetic heterogeneity, with important implications for genetic and rehabilitative studies of SDD.","Literature on Asperger's syndrome (AS) has mainly described symptoms that are manifested in boys. Only recently, attention has been paid on the features in AS girls that differ from the typical clinical picture and may complicate the detection of the syndrome. Because AS girls may react passively in general or compensate or hide their difficulties by other abilities, the need for support is not necessarily brought up. In that case this developmental disorder easily remains unrecognized. Recognition of the syndrome at an early stage makes early supportive actions possible.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger's disorder/syndrome"" refers to a specific social developmental disorder that affects face recognition capabilities and other social interaction skills. Text A discusses the study of face recognition among individuals with social developmental disorders including Asperger's, analyzing their abilities in terms of face perception, facial memory, and recognition. Text B focuses on specific manifestations of Asperger's syndrome in girls and highlights how it might be under-recognized due to passive behaviors or compensation of difficulties. Despite discussing different aspects and patient demographics, the core meaning relating to Asperger's as a neurological condition that impacts social interactions and behaviors remains consistent across both texts. There is no significant semantic drift in the use of ""Asperger"" between the two texts; it retains its clinical and diagnostic implications related to a form of autism spectrum disorder that primarily affects social interactions."
4,Asperger,"Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a new diagnosis in the 10th edition of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). AS is closely related to infantile autism and belongs to the so-called pervasive developmental disorders. The characteristics of the disorder are qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests and often motor clumsiness and problems with nonverbal and social aspects of communication. The sex ratio is about eight boys to one girl and the prevalence among schoolage boys is about 0.3%. The abnormalities normally persist into adulthood. Early diagnosis and a combination of social, educational and psychiatric interventions are necessary to relieve the stress on the person with AS and his family. Differential diagnoses and assessment are discussed.","This follow-up study evaluated cognitive and language development in Asperger's disorder (AD) patients diagnosed at the age of 5 to 6 years, with initial complaints of delays in motor or language development in infancy. We evaluated 12 patients (10 males and 2 females) using two intelligence tests:Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development 2001 (K-scale) for those under 6 years, and WISC-III for those over 5-6 years. The cognitive-adaptive area (C-A) of the former test was compared to the performance IQ (PIQ) of the latter test, and the language-social area (L-S) of the former to verbal IQ (VIQ) of the latter. The mean age at the first examination was 3.2 years (range:2.1-4.6 years), and the average age at follow-up was 7.7 years (range:5.3-12.3 years). The average length of follow-up from the initial visit was 5.6 years (range:3.3-8.6 years). During follow-up, the PIQ, VIQ and full scale DQ or IQ (F-DQ/IQ) improved with age. Average scores of the 12 patients at the first examination and last follow-up evaluated by K-scale were:C-A:70.6 (first) and 84.5 (last), L-S:64.8 (first) and 85.8 (last), and F-DQ:68.5 (first) and 84.8 (last). Compared to those with AD, 12 autistic patients with the Kanner type (10 males and 2 females) who visited our clinic during almost the same period, and belonged to almost the same age group, showed average scores at the first examination and last follow-up of:C-A: 61.9 (first) and43.3 (last), L-S:43.0 (first) and43.4 (last), and F-DQ:60.2 (first) and44.5 (last). From these observations, it is apparent that AD patients also showed language delay during infancy, but they improved rapidly between the ages of 4-6 years. This developmental spurt was not seen in autistic patients with the Kanner type.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" (referred to as Asperger's syndrome in Text A and Asperger's disorder in Text B) remains consistent in its usage concerning a developmental disorder characterized by specific social and communicative challenges, alongside repetitive patterns of behavior. Text A introduces Asperger's syndrome as a diagnosis within the spectrum of pervasive developmental disorders, highlighting traits like social interaction difficulties, restricted behavior patterns, and potential motor clumsiness. Text B continues these themes, primarily evaluating cognitive and language developments within individuals diagnosed with Asperger's disorder, mapping improvements over time and comparing it with autism (Kanner type). Both texts address it within the clinical and developmental framework, indicating that the meaning around Asperger's syndrome/disorder as a specific form of autism spectrum disorder remains the same between the two periods."
5,Asperger,"The ability to attribute mental states to others ('theory of mind') pervades normal social interaction and is impaired in autistic individuals. In a previous positron emission tomography scan study of normal volunteers, performing a 'theory of mind' task was associated with activity in left medial prefrontal cortex. We used the same paradigm in five patients with Asperger syndrome, a mild variant of autism with normal intellectual functioning. No task-related activity was found in this region, but normal activity was observed in immediately adjacent areas. This result suggests that a highly circumscribed region of left medial prefrontal cortex is a crucial component of the brain system that underlies the normal understanding of other minds.","This study was designed to determine if ToM abilities of children with autism and Asperger syndrome differentiate into Intrapersonal ToM and Social ToM. A battery of Social and Intrapersonal ToM tasks was administered to 39 children with autism and 34 children with Asperger syndrome. For both groups of children, ToM differentiated and Intrapersonal ToM was stronger than Social ToM. This asymmetry was greater for children with autism, whose Social ToM was especially weak. These results support a differentiated, as opposed to integrated, ToM.

- Reason: Both text A and text B center around the cognitive features and manifestations of Asperger syndrome, particularly in the context of the theory of mind (ToM) abilities, which relate to the understanding of others' mental states. Although different aspects and details of ToM abilities are discussed in the contexts of experimental setups or developmental studies, Asperger is consistently portrayed as a variant within the autism spectrum characterized by particular cognitive processing patterns. Neither text redefines or substantially alters the underlying recognition of Asperger syndrome as a distinct, yet connected, condition within the autism spectrum. Hence, the use and meaning of ""Asperger"" have remained essentially unchanged between the contexts of these texts."
6,Asperger,"Details are given of a new advanced theory of mind task, developed to approximate the demands of real-life mentalizing in able individuals with autism. Excerpts of films showing characters in social situations were presented, with participants required to answer questions on characters' mental states and on control, nonsocial questions. When compared with control participants, adults with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome were most impaired in their ability to answer the questions requiring mind-reading ability. Although the present findings have implications for task modification, such naturalistic, dynamic stimuli are held to offer an important means of studying subtle difficulties in mentalistic understanding.","Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome and autism, is a highly genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. There is a consensus that ASD has a biological basis, and it has been proposed that it is a ""connectivity"" disorder.

However, nobody has investigated the microstructural integrity of whole brain white matter in people with Asperger syndrome.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, ""Asperger"" (referring to Asperger syndrome) is described within the context of a spectrum of autism-related conditions, specifically focusing on the cognitive and neurodevelopmental aspects of individuals with this syndrome. In Text A, Asperger syndrome is discussed in relation to its effects on social cognition and mental state comprehension — core traits frequently associated with Asperger syndrome. In Text B, although the discussion shifts towards a genetic and biological basis of Asperger syndrome (including neuroimaging analysis), the underlying thematic connection remains the focus on Asperger syndrome as part of broader Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) considerations. There's a consistent portrayal of Asperger syndrome in relation to its cognitive and neurodevelopmental characteristics, suggesting no significant semantic drift in the use of the term over the compared periods."
7,Asperger,"To study the personality characteristics of adults with Asperger syndrome, and investigate the value of self-rating personality inventories, we administered the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) to 31 outpatients with Asperger syndrome. The TCI is a self-rating personality inventory that has been validated in the Swedish general population. The results were compared with age- and sex-matched norm groups. Participants with Asperger syndrome scored significantly higher on harm avoidance and lower on self-directedness and cooperativeness. Reward dependence and novelty seeking tended to be low. They also had significantly higher rarity scores, reflecting idiosyncratic perspectives. The most common temperament configurations were 'obsessional', 'passive-dependent' and'explosive'. Character, reflecting conceptual maturity, was poorly developed in the majority of our subjects. The self-ratings of persons with Asperger syndrome thus indicated anxious personalities with coping difficulties in the areas of social interaction and self-directedness, a picture corresponding to the clinical descriptions of Asperger syndrome.","The aim of the study was to validate the German version of the Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome (ASAS). Furthermore, the scoring of the ASAS as applied by the Australian authors was verified.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""Asperger"" clearly refers to Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum characterized by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Text A provides a detailed analysis of the personality characteristics of individuals with Asperger syndrome, highlighting specific traits and challenges associated with the condition. Text B mentions the validation process of a specific scale (ASAS) designed to assess Asperger's syndrome, reinforcing the context of Asperger as a diagnosis within the clinical and psychological assessment frameworks. In both cases, the term is used consistently within the context of a developmental and psychological disorder, indicating no significant semantic drift in the term's meaning or usage over time within the described academic and medical contexts."
8,Asperger,"Eighty children, 3-17 years of age, with autism or Asperger syndrome and mild to severe distress in the presence of some sounds, were randomly allocated to two groups. The experimental group received auditory training and the control group listened to the same unmodified music under the same conditions. Significant improvements in behavior and severity of autism were maintained for 12 months by both groups. Informal data suggested that a range of abnormal responses to sound and other sensory abnormalities may also have improved. Verbal and performance IQ increased significantly 3 to 12 months after interventions. Findings suggest that some aspect of both auditory training and listening to selected unmodified music may have a beneficial effect on children with autism and sound sensitivity, and indicate a need for further research into the effects that led to these changes and the mechanisms involved in the sensory abnormalities commonly associated with autism.","Motor dysfunction is common to both autism and Asperger syndrome, but the underlying neurophysiological impairments are unclear. Neurophysiological examinations of motor dysfunction can provide information about likely sites of functional impairment and can contribute to the debate about whether autism and Asperger syndrome are variants of the same disorder or fundamentally distinct neurodevelopmental conditions. We investigated the neurophysiology of internally determined motor activity in autism and Asperger syndrome via examination of movement-related potentials (MRPs).","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" retains its usage within the framework of neurodevelopmental disorders that relate closely to, or are part of the autism spectrum. Text A discusses the impact of auditory training on children with Asperger syndrome in conjunction with autism, emphasizing therapeutic interventions and their effects on associated symptoms. Text B explores neurophysiological aspects of motor dysfunction in both autism and Asperger syndrome, examining whether they might be distinct conditions or variants of the same disorder. Despite slightly differing focuses (behavioral and neurophysiological), both texts use ""Asperger"" to label a specific form within the broader category of autism-related conditions, maintaining a consistent meaning regarding its classification as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Therefore, there does not appear to be significant semantic drift in the term ""Asperger"" between the contexts provided in these two texts."
9,Asperger,"Autism is heterogeneous with respect to clinical symptoms and etiology. To sort out this heterogeneity in autism, we investigated whether specific neurobiological markers vary in parallel to core symptomatology. Specifically, we assessed growth hormone response to the 5-HT 1d agonist, sumatriptan, and linked this measure of serotonergic function to the severity of repetitive behaviors in adult autistic patients. Eleven adult patients with autism or Asperger's disorder were randomized to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges, separated by a one-week interval. In adult autistic disorders, severity of repetitive behaviors at baseline, as measured by YBOCS-compulsion score, significantly positively correlated with both peak delta growth hormone response and area under the curve growth hormone response to sumatriptan. Thus, the severity of a specific behavioral dimension in autism (repetitive behaviors) parallels the sensitivity of the 5-HT 1d receptor, as manifest by sumatriptan elicited GH response.","Memory for action is enhanced if individuals are allowed to perform the corresponding movements, compared to when they simply listen to them (enactment effect). Previous studies have shown that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties with processes involving the self, such as autobiographical memories and self performed actions. The present study aimed at assessing memory for action in Asperger Syndrome (AS). We investigated whether adults with AS would benefit from the enactment effect when recalling a list of previously performed items vs. items that were only visually and verbally experienced through three experimental tasks (Free Recall, Old/New Recognition and Source Memory). The results showed that while performance on Recognition and Source Memory tasks was preserved in individuals with AS, the enactment effect for self-performed actions was not consistently present, as revealed by the lower number of performed actions being recalled on the Free Recall test, as compared to adults with typical development. Subtle difficulties in encoding specific motor and proprioceptive signals during action execution in individuals with AS might affect retrieval of relevant personal episodic information. These disturbances might be associated to an impaired action monitoring system.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger Syndrome (AS)"" refers to a form of Autism Spectrum Disorder characterized by specific behavioral and neurological traits. Both texts focus on research related to Asperger's, examining neurological responses and memory functions. The context and underlying association of ""Asperger"" with specific neurological and behavioral patterns remain consistent between the two texts, irrespective of different aspects being studied (serotonergic functions in Text A and memory for action in Text B). There is no evidence of a significant shift in the meaning or medical/scientific understanding of Asperger's as a distinct part of the broader autism spectrum."
10,Asperger,"The study explores the common clinical impression and previously reported finding by Hebebrand et al. (7) of reduced body weight in male children and adolescents with Asperger's disorder (AD). Body weight and height of 36 consecutively admitted male patients with AD were retrospectively assessed for the calculation of body mass indices (BMI, kg/m2). The BMIs were transformed to percentile ranks and plotted into BMI-centiles representative for the German population. In addition, comorbid psychopathology was assessed to explore a possible relationship between associated psychopathology and body weight. The mean BMI-centile of all patients was 34.7 +/- 31.8 and, thus, differed significantly from the mean centile of an age- and gender-matched psychiatric control group, which was 52.7 +/- 28.3. Thirteen patients had a BMI below the 10th centile and five even below the third. Three of the latter presented with disturbed eating behaviour. Altogether four patients showed disturbed eating behaviour. They had a significantly lower mean BMI-centile than the rest of the group. The BMI-centiles of patients with other additional psychopathology did not differ significantly from the mean percentile of the whole cohort. The results clearly show an increased risk for underweight and disturbed eating behaviour in patients with Asperger's disorder which should be evaluated in further studies.","A number of studies have reported that parents of autistic children face higher levels of stress, but few studies examined the stress associated with the home care of children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) other than autistic disorder. The aims of the present study were therefore to (i) evaluate the emotional stress level of parents caring for their children with PDD; and (ii) explore the correlates of their emotional stress. Participants were 147 families (147 mothers and 122 fathers) of 158 children with PDD (42 with autistic disorder, 35 with Asperger's disorder and 81 with PDD not otherwise specified). K6 was used to measure the stress level of the parents. Marital relationships and personality were assessed with the Intimate Bond Measure and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory, respectively. The parents also rated the characteristics of their children with PDD through the Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS). The mean K6 score of the mothers was significantly higher than that of the women in the general population in Japan. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that the emotional stress of the mothers was correlated with the personality traits of Neuroticism and Agreeableness, perceived Control by the husband, and the children's PARS score. Clinicians can deliver better service by paying appropriate attention to the emotional distress of mothers of children with not only autistic disorder but also other PDD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
  The usage of the term ""Asperger"" in both Text A and Text B refers to the specific condition known as Asperger's disorder (AD) within the spectrum of autism or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). In Text A, Asperger's disorder is discussed in the context of a study focusing on body weight and eating behaviors in male children diagnosed with this condition. In Text B, Asperger's disorder is mentioned as part of a broader study which includes families dealing with various forms of PDD, including Asperger's. Both texts from different periods use the term to denote a specific category of autism spectrum disorder characterized by its unique symptoms and challenges, without indicating a shift in meaning or connotation over time. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""Asperger"" has remained consistent, focusing on describing a subset of autism spectrum disorder with particular characteristics.

11,Asperger,"The literature is reviewed on children variously described as having 'schizoid' personality disorders, Asperger's syndrome, and schizotypal personality disorders, with the aim of clarifying the nature of these clinical syndromes, and in particular the features of those children whose follow-up characteristics are described in the following two papers.","Parental immigration has been suggested as a possible risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but findings have been inconsistent. Very few studies have focused specifically on Asperger's syndrome. The aim of this study was to examine the association between maternal and paternal immigration and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome in offspring. The study was a nested case-control study based on a national birth cohort in Finland. Children born in 1987-2005 and diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome by the year 2007 were identified from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (N = 1,783). Four matched controls for each case were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register (N = 7,106). Information on maternal and paternal country of birth and mother tongue was collected from the Finnish Central Population Register. The study showed that children whose parents are both immigrants have a significantly lower likelihood of being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome than those with two Finnish parents [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.4]. No significant associations were found between having only one immigrant parent and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. A regional analysis showed a significantly decreased likelihood of the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome in children whose mother (aOR 0.1, 95 % CI 0.01-0.5) or father (aOR 0.2, 95 % CI 0.05-0.5) was born in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings may help in identifying risk factors for different ASD subtypes. On the other hand, they might reflect service use of immigrant families in Finland.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger's syndrome, which is a consistent definition in both contexts. Text A discusses Asperger's syndrome in the framework of broader personality and developmental disorders, aiming to clarify its distinct clinical features. Text B examines Asperger's syndrome within the context of a study of its likelihood among children of immigrant parents in comparison to non-immigrant parents, still referring specifically to it as a subtype of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Despite the different foci in each text - one broadly defining and differentiating Asperger's from related conditions, and the other investigating sociodemographic factors associated with its diagnosis - the core understanding of Asperger as a specific autism spectrum disorder with distinct clinical characteristics remains unchanged between the two periods."
12,Asperger,To determine what clinical symptoms clinicians have been using to distinguish between Asperger's disorder (AsD) and autistic disorder (AD).,"Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) share common features in terms of deficits in emotion regulation and recognition, sensory sensitivity, proprioception and interoception. Nevertheless, few studies have assessed their overlap. We recruited 21 patients with FNDs, 30 individuals with ASDs without intellectual disabilities and 45 neurotypical adults (NA). Participants completed: the Autism Quotient (AQ); the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R); and a questionnaire assessing functional neurological symptoms (FNS). ASDs participants also completed the Sensory Perception Quotient-Short Form (SPQ-SF35), assessing sensory sensitivity. In the FNDs sample, no patient scored above the clinical cut-off at the AQ and the 19% scored above the cut-off at the RAADS-R, a prevalence similar to the one we found in NA (15.6%; both p > 0.05). The 86.7% of participants with ASDs reported at least one FNS, a prevalence significantly higher than the NA one (35.6%, p < 0.001). In the ASDs sample, tactile hypersensitivity was found to be a risk factor for functional weakness (OR = 0.74, p = 0.033) and paraesthesia (OR = 0.753, p = 0.019). In conclusions, FNDs individuals did not present autistic traits more than NA, but ASDs individuals presented a higher number of FNSs than NA; this rate was associated with higher sensory sensitivity, especially in the touch domain.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The term ""Asperger"" in both Text A and Text B is used in contexts that relate it directly to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In Text A, ""Asperger's disorder"" is specifically compared with ""autistic disorder,"" aligning it within the broader category of autism spectrum disorders. Text B extends this alignment by discussing ""Asperger"" as part of the studies on broader ASDs without intellectual disabilities, showing its consideration within the same spectrum but in a specific subset that may not include intellectual disabilities. Thus, across both texts from different periods, the term ""Asperger"" has maintained its meaning and association within the scope of autism spectrum conditions, showing no significant semantic drift."
13,Asperger,"The majority of children with autism show deviance and socially or psychiatrically handicapping conditions throughout life. Only a small proportion of those with classical childhood autism lead independent adult lives. Others, particularly those with 'high-functioning' autism and so-called Asperger syndrome will improve enough to live an independent adult life. The level of mental retardation and other comorbid conditions (such as medical syndromes and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy) is important in predicting outcome. An IQ below 50 around school age predicts severe restriction of social and adaptive functioning in adult life. The absence of communicative speech at 5-6 years of age is indicative of a poorer long-term overall outcome. There is a clear co-variation between IQ and level of communication, but probably there is some prognostic factor in language development apart from this. Measures of flexibility and cognitive shifting abilities tend to be good predictors of social outcome in a few studies. There is a continued need for prospective, longitudinal studies of children with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in Asperger syndrome. The role of interventions of various kinds needs to be addressed in such studies.","Patients with Asperger syndrome are often diagnosed late or are wrongly considered to have schizophrenia. Misdiagnosing Asperger syndrome creates serious problems by preventing effective therapy. Several clinical signs described in Asperger syndrome could also be considered as clinical signs of schizophrenia, including impaired social interactions, disabilities in communication, restricted interests, and delusions of persecution. A number of clinical features may facilitate the differential diagnosis: younger age at onset, family history of pervasive developmental disorder, recurring conversations on the same topic, pragmatic aspects of language use, oddities of intonation and pitch, lack of imagination, and incomprehension of social rules are more characteristic of Asperger syndrome. Accurate distinction between Asperger syndrome and schizophrenia would make it possible to offer more treatment appropriate to the patient's functioning.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger syndrome"" consistently refers to a condition characterized by specific challenges in social interactions, communication skills, and behavioral patterns. Text A focuses on the prognosis and outcomes of Asperger syndrome within the autism spectrum, mentioning features like handling independence in adulthood, associated IQ levels, and the impact of early language development on prognosis. Text B discusses the difficulties in diagnosing Asperger syndrome, highlighting the similarity of its symptoms with schizophrenia, and emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between the two for proper treatment.

Despite discussing different aspects of the condition — Text A focuses on developmental and prognostic attributes while Text B centers around diagnostic challenges — both texts portray Asperger syndrome as a distinct diagnostic entity within the broader autism spectrum, characterized by specific interaction and communication patterns. The core understanding of Asperger syndrome as a part of the autism spectrum with unique developmental and behavioral presentations remains consistent between the texts, thus indicating that the meaning of ""Asperger"" has not undergone a significant semantic drift."
14,Asperger,"Friendship is an important part of normal social functioning, yet there are precious few instruments for measuring individual differences in this domain. In this article, we report a new self-report questionnaire, the Friendship Questionnaire (FQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. A high score on the FQ is achieved by the respondent reporting that they enjoy close, empathic, supportive, caring friendships that are important to them; that they like and are interested in people; and that they enjoy interacting with others for its own sake. The FQ has a maximum score of 135 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1, we carried out a study of n = 76 (27 males and 49 females) adults from a general population, to test for previously reported sex differences in friendships. This confirmed that women scored significantly higher than men. In Study 2, we employed the FQ with n = 68 adults (51 males, 17 females) with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism to test the theory that autism is an extreme form of the male brain. The adults with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism scored significantly lower on the FQ than both the male and female controls from Study 1. The FQ thus reveals both a sex difference in the style of friendship in the general population, and provides support for the extreme male brain theory of autism.","Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is the most common and least satisfactory of the PDD diagnoses. It is not formally operationalized, which limits its reliability and has hampered attempts to assess its validity. We aimed, first, to improve the reliability and replicability of PDD-NOS by operationalizing its DSM-IV-TR description and, second, to test its validity through comparison with autistic disorder (AD) and Asperger's disorder (AsD). In a sample of 256 young people (mean age = 9.1 years) we used Developmental, Diagnostic and Dimensional (3Di) algorithmic analysis to classify DSM-IV-TR AD (n = 97), AsD (n = 93) and PDD-NOS (n = 66). Groups were compared on independent measures of core PDD symptomatology, associated autistic features, and intelligence. Contrary to the assumption that PDD-NOS is heterogeneous, almost all (97%) of those with PDD-NOS had one distinct symptom pattern, namely impairments in social reciprocity and communication, without significant repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (RSB). Compared to AD and AsD, they had comparably severe but more circumscribed social communication difficulties, with fewer non-social features of autism, such as sensory, feeding and visuo-spatial problems. These individuals appear to have a distinct variant of autism that does not merely sit at the less severe end of the same continuum of symptoms. The current draft guidelines for DSM-V, which mandate the presence of RSBs for any PDD diagnosis, would exclude such people from the autistic spectrum.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the usage of ""Asperger"" is directly linked with Asperger Syndrome as a form of autism characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It associates Asperger Syndrome within a framework of being an 'extreme male brain' theory of autism, suggesting attributes like a lower ability in forming typical friendships compared to neurotypical controls. Conversely, Text B discusses ""Asperger's disorder (AsD)"" under the broader diagnostic umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders, particularly contrasting it with other disorders like autistic disorder (AD) and PDD-NOS. Here, Asperger's disorder is described as having distinct and severe social communication difficulties, categorized distinctly from other forms of autism which include repetitive behaviors, sensory issues, etc. The use in Text B reflects a nuanced clinical and diagnostic perspective, highlighting different facets and distinctions of the disorder within the autism spectrum more comprehensively.

Thus, we observe a shift from a broader and somewhat speculative linking of Asperger Syndrome with gender-specific theories in Text A, to a more differentiated and clinically nuanced understanding in Text B, indicating a semantic drift in the contextual and diagnostic usage of the term ""Asperger."""
15,Asperger,"This follow-up study reports data on 18 children fulfilling the ICD-10 criteria for childhood autism (n = 9) and Asperger syndrome (n = 9). In connection with the present study the original child psychiatric records were reassessed according to the ICD-10 criteria. The children were followed over a period of 30 years. The mean age at the time of study was 38 years. The results show that in adulthood the autistic patients had a poorer outcome than children with Asperger syndrome as regards education, employment, autonomy, marriage, reproduction and the need for continuing medical and institutional care. Particular attention is given to pharmacotherapy and the relationship between the childhood disorder and psychiatric morbidity in adult life.","NRXN1 is highly expressed in brain and has been shown recently to be associated with ASD, schizophrenia, cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, and alcohol and nicotine dependence. We present three families, in whom we identified intragenic rearrangements within NRXN1 using a clinical targeted oligonucleotide array CGH. An approximately 380 kb deletion was identified in a woman with Asperger syndrome, anxiety, and depression and in all four of her children affected with autism, anxiety, developmental delay, and speech delay but not in an unaffected child. An approximately 180 kb tandem duplication was found in a patient with autistic disorder and cognitive delays, and in his mother and younger brother who have speech delay. An approximately 330 kb tandem duplication was identified in a patient with autistic features. As predicted by conceptual translation, all three genomic rearrangements led to the premature truncation of NRXN1. Our data support previous observations that NRXN1 may be pathogenic in a wide variety of psychiatric diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, global developmental delay, anxiety, and depression.","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In Text A, ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger syndrome, which is depicted as a condition within the autism spectrum but distinct enough from more severe forms like childhood autism. The text focuses on long-term outcomes and differences between those diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and other forms of autism. In Text B, ""Asperger"" remains contextually linked to autism spectrum disorders, even if the focus shifts slightly towards genetic influences and associations with other cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. In both texts, Asperger syndrome is treated as part of broader autism spectrum disorders, concentrating on its diagnostic features, associated conditions, and impact on life outcomes, suggesting that the understanding and classification of Asperger within the realm of psychiatric and developmental disorders has not fundamentally changed. This maintains a consistent use of the term across the decades covered by the texts, indicating no significant semantic drift."
16,Asperger,"This paper was commissioned by the committee on the Effectiveness of Early Education in Autism of the National Research Council (NRC). It provides a review of epidemiological studies of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) which updates a previously published article (The epidemiology of autism: a review. Psychological Medicine 1999; 29: 769-786). The design, sample characteristics of 32 surveys published between 1966 and 2001 are described. Recent surveys suggest that the rate for all forms of PDDs are around 30/10,000 but more recent surveys suggest that the estimate might be as high as 60/10,000. The rate for Asperger disorder is not well established, and a conservative figure is 2.5/10,000. Childhood disintegrative disorder is extremely rare with a pooled estimate across studies of 0.2/10,000. A detailed discussion of the possible interpretations of trends over time in prevalence rates is provided. There is evidence that changes in case definition and improved awareness explain much of the upward trend of rates in recent decades. However, available epidemiological surveys do not provide an adequate test of the hypothesis of a changing incidence of PDDs.","A subgroup of persons with anorexia nervosa (AN) have been proposed to have sociocommunicative problems corresponding to autism spectrum disorders [ASDs, i.e. DSM-IV pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs): autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, PDD not otherwise specified (NOS)]. Here, clinical problems, personality traits, cognitive test results and outcome are compared across 16 subjects (32%) with teenage-onset AN who meet or have met ASD criteria (AN+ASD), 34 ASD-negative AN subjects and matched controls from a longitudinal Swedish study including four waves of independent assessments from the teens to the early thirties.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers to the same condition, i.e., Asperger's disorder, which is recognized within the broader grouping of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Text A provides a clinical and epidemiological context, discussing prevalence rates and variations over time, while Text B investigates sociocommunicative problems in individuals with anorexia nervosa, comparing those with and without concurrent ASD characteristics such as Asperger's disorder. Despite the different avenues of discussion (epidemiology vs. clinical features in conjunction with another disorder), the underlying definition and perception of Asperger's disorder remain consistent between the two texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in how ""Asperger"" is understood or applied from the earlier to the later text."
17,Asperger,"This study compared the neuropsychological profiles of individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger's syndrome (AS). In comparison with matched controls, both groups were impaired on executive function tests. Only the HFA group demonstrated deficits in theory of mind and verbal memory, performing more poorly than both controls and AS subjects. These results suggest that: (1) HFA and AS are empirically distinguishable on measures independent of diagnostic criteria, and (2) impairment on theory of mind measures is not universally found among individuals with autistic spectrum conditions. The primacy of executive function and theory of mind deficits to autism is discussed.","The pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is not completely understood, but there is evidence of associations with altered immune responses. The aim of this study was to determine the serum levels of various cytokines in children with ASD and in healthy controls, in order to determine their role in ASD and its diagnostic subgroups. Sixty-five ASD patients were enrolled from an epidemiological survey in Norway, of which 30 were diagnosed with childhood autism, 16 with Asperger syndrome, 12 with atypical autism, 1 with Rett syndrome, and 6 with another ASD diagnosis. The serum levels of 12 cytokines were measured in all of the patients and in 30 healthy children. The cytokine levels did not differ significantly between the ASD group and the healthy controls. However, the interleukin-8 (IL-8) level was significantly higher (6.82 vs 4.58 pg/ml, p = 0.017) while that of IL-10 was significantly lower (2.24 vs 6.49 pg/ml, p = 0.009) in patients with childhood autism than in controls. Furthermore, the IL-8 level was significantly higher in childhood autism than in Asperger syndrome (6.82 vs 4.05 pg/ml, p = 0.013). Our study shows that the cytokine profile of children diagnosed with ASD, regardless of the subdiagnosis, does not differ from healthy controls. However, differentiation into different diagnostic subgroups reveals significantly different levels of IL-8 and IL-10. This indicates that different mechanisms may underlie the different ASD subdiagnoses. Future research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD should pay more attention to the different subdiagnoses of ASD.","- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:** In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" is used within the context of the spectrum of autism disorders. Text A discusses Asperger's syndrome (AS) in contrast to high-functioning autism (HFA), examining differences in neuropsychological profiles of these subcategories, specifically noting that both pertain to autism spectrum conditions. Similarly, Text B includes ""Asperger syndrome"" as one of the specific diagnoses within the overarching category of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), focusing on aspects such as immune response distinctions among various ASD subtypes. Therefore, across both texts, the term ""Asperger"" remains associated with a specific subtype of autism characterized by particular diagnostic features, maintaining its core meaning without any significant shift in definition or connotation between the two time periods."
18,Asperger,"Alan Turing was born in Paddington, London on June 23, 1912 . His family were middle-class and well-off. He was fascinated with science from an early age and showed precocious talent, especially in the areas of chemistry and mathematics. He attended Sherbourne Public School and then King's College, Cambridge where he studied mathematics. His areas of interest at Cambridge were probability theory and mathematical logic. It was at Cambridge that he first conceptualised the Universal Turing Machine, an idea that was to evolve into the modern theory of computing. He has been referred to as the father of the computer. He worked on a cipher machine at Princeton University between 1936 and 1938. He worked for the British Government during World War II with the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park. He was ultimately the key player in deciphering the German 'Enigma' code used by its submarines during the war. After the war he took up a post in Manchester University where he continued to work on ideas of artificial intelligence. He was arrested and charged for homosexual activity in 1952 and underwent a course of oestrogen therapy. He committed suicide in 1954. He was regarded as being socially aloof and eccentric by colleagues and friends. He was interested in mathematics, chemistry and logic from an early age, to the exclusion of other activities. This paper attempts to establish whether he fulfilled the criteria for Asperger's syndrome.","The present study examined the applicability of the double ABCX model of family adjustment in explaining maternal adjustment to caring for a child diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Forty-seven mothers completed questionnaires at a university clinic while their children were participating in an anxiety intervention. The children were aged between 10 and 12 years. Results of correlations showed that each of the model components was related to one or more domains of maternal adjustment in the direction predicted, with the exception of problem-focused coping. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that, after controlling for the effects of relevant demographics, stressor severity, pile-up of demands and coping were related to adjustment. Findings indicate the utility of the double ABCX model in guiding research into parental adjustment when caring for a child with Asperger syndrome. Limitations of the study and clinical implications are discussed.","###Label:

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" (referring to Asperger's syndrome) is used within the realm of psychological and developmental assessment, though the contexts differ slightly. Text A explores the historical figure Alan Turing and considers whether his behaviors and characteristics might retrospectively indicate Asperger's syndrome. This use highlights the diagnostic criteria and social/behavioral markers associated with Asperger's syndrome. Text B deals with psychological research related to mothers managing the care of children diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, again focusing on behavioral and psychological frameworks tied to the condition.

In both cases, despite the different applications (historical retrospective diagnosis versus contemporary family impact study), the word ""Asperger"" retains its core meaning related to a specific set of behavioral and developmental characteristics classified within the autism spectrum. Thus, there's no significant semantic drift in the term between the two periods."
19,Asperger,"In some cases of treatment-resistant chronic mental illness, it may be useful to reconsider the primary diagnosis. Patients with Asperger's syndrome, a rare pervasive developmental disorder, have characteristics such as eccentricities, emotional lability, anxiety, poor social functioning, repetitive behavior, and fixed habits that can mimic symptoms of other illnesses, including schizophrenia spectrum illness, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Their disorganizing anxiety in response to stress, which may be accompanied by increased oddness of speech, can easily be misinterpreted as psychosis. The author describes features of Asperger's syndrome, discusses differential diagnosis, and presents care examples. A habilitative treatment plan that concentrates on modifying the patient's eccentricities into strengths and carefully tailors the work and living situation may be effective with some patients.","Grunya Efimovna Sukhareva's seminal role in being the first to publish a clinical description of autistic traits in 1925, before both Kanner and Asperger, has been revealed relatively recently. Nevertheless, Sukhareva's work is little known and largely unrecognised beyond Russia. Amidst calls for greater recognition of her pivotal contribution in the genesis of autism conceptualisation and categorisation, this article provides a biographical and historical background. Sukhareva's wide-ranging psychiatric work is adumbrated and her pioneering efforts in conceptualising both schizophrenia and autism are elucidated. The article reflects on possible explanations for the belated and incomplete recognition of Sukhareva's role. The current article indicates how Sukhareva's work was ahead of its time in reflecting modern criteria for autism diagnoses and in its focus on female case studies. Sukhareva's somewhat precarious position as a foremost psychiatrist condemned in the Stalinist years for being anti-Marxist is explicated. The article outlines further directions for academic research on Sukhareva's work and contributions.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: The usage and conceptualization of the term ""Asperger"" show a significant shift between the two texts. In Text A, ""Asperger's syndrome"" is described with a focus on clinical symptoms and its differential diagnosis from other mental disorders, highlighting how it can mimic other conditions and emphasizing therapeutic approaches tailored to modify behaviors. In contrast, Text B discusses the historical and biographical context of research into the autism spectrum, mentioning ""Asperger"" in the course of detailing the contributions of early researchers in the field like Sukhareva. The reflection on historical understanding and acknowledgment in Text B suggests a broader, more historical and conceptual use of the term, diverging from the purely clinical application seen in Text A. Additionally, the overall discourse surrounding Asperger's syndrome has evolved, influenced by broader developments in the understanding of the autism spectrum. Therefore, the semantic drift in ""Asperger"" from a strictly clinical description to a context of historical and research-oriented discussion indicates a significant change in its usage and meaning over time."
20,Asperger,"This study examined the relationship between the development of theory of mind and the development of the belief terms think, know, and guess. Children with autism and Asperger syndrome, matched to children with specific language impairment and normal development, completed false belief, belief term comprehension, and belief term expression tasks. The autistic group's performance on the false belief, belief term comprehension, and belief term expression tasks was significantly poorer than that of the Asperger, language impaired, and normal groups. Across groups an association was found between false belief and belief term performance. Results support a growing body of literature demonstrating links between the development of theory of mind and communicative competence.","This is the first report from a large multiple baseline single-subject design study of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

Results indicated significant changes from pre- to post- measures on both verbal/nonverbal ""expected"" and ""unexpected"" behaviors, significant increases in the subcategories of ""expected verbal"", ""listening/thinking with eyes"", and ""initiations"", and robust decreases in the subcategories of ""unexpected-verbal"" and ""unexpected-nonverbal"".

- Target word: Asperger
- Text A: In this older text, Asperger syndrome is distinctively discussed as a separate entity from other autism spectrum disorders. The text examines cognitive aspects related to Asperger syndrome, particularly focusing on theory of mind and its development in children with the condition as compared to those with autism and other developmental issues. It stresses differences in cognitive and communicative competencies between groups, portraying Asperger syndrome in a specific clinical light.

- Text B: The newer text still acknowledges Asperger syndrome as part of the autism spectrum (ASD), aligning it closely with High Functioning Autism (HFA). The emphasis is on applying therapeutic social cognitive approaches to improve social behaviors, suggesting a functional and integrative perspective with other conditions on the spectrum. The mention of High Functioning Autism alongside Asperger's suggests a shift towards a less distinct separation of these categories within ASD.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The semantic drift in the term ""Asperger"" from Text A to Text B is evident, with usage shifting from a distinct diagnostic category to a more integrated aspect of the broader autism spectrum disorder, where it is closely associated or treated similarly to high-functioning autism. This reflects a change in conceptualization and practical approaches in the fields of psychology and therapy over the two decades, influenced by evolving diagnostic criteria and therapeutic methodologies."
21,Asperger,"The high-functioning Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) is a 27-item checklist for completion by lay informants when assessing symptoms characteristic of Asperger syndrome and other high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in children and adolescents with normal intelligence or mild mental retardation. Data for parent and teacher ratings in a clinical sample are presented along with various measures of reliability and validity. Optimal cutoff scores were estimated, using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Findings indicate that the ASSQ is a useful brief screening device for the identification of autism spectrum disorders in clinical settings.","Several studies have reported that individuals with autism and Asperger's syndrome show a local processing bias on tasks involving features and configurations. This study assessed whether this bias results from differences in the perception of features or a cognitive bias to attend to features in autism as a consequence of a deficit in attending to configurations. Children with autism and typically developing children performed a task assessing the initial perceptual representation of features and configurations following a 50 ms stimulus display and the development of the perceptual representation by grouping processes following an 800 ms stimulus display. No differences were observed between the two groups, suggesting that the perceptual and attentional mechanisms marshalled by this task operate typically in children with autism.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the use of the word ""Asperger"" remains consistent, where it is associated with a specific subset of autism spectrum disorders characterized by high-functioning individuals. Text A discusses Asperger syndrome in the context of a screening tool for autism spectrum disorders among children and adolescents who generally have normal intelligence or mild mental retardation. It emphasizes the identification and diagnostic aspects of Asperger syndrome. Similarly, Text B explores cognitive features in individuals with autism and Asperger's syndrome, focusing on their local processing bias and cognitive tendencies. In both texts, Asperger’s is discussed with respect to its manifestation and effects on cognitive processing in individuals, maintaining its medical and behavioral context without significant shifts in meaning over time."
22,Asperger,"Although lack of empathy has been considered a central characteristic of Asperger syndrome, quantitative and qualitative assessments of empathy in this syndrome are lacking. We present two cases of adolescents with Asperger syndrome who show extreme deficits on measures of both cognitive and affective empathy. Analysis of their performance on tasks assessing cognitive and affective processing did not reveal significant impairment in executive functions, nor in their ability to recognize emotions or the ability to create a mental representation of another person's knowledge. However, both patients were unable to integrate the emotional content with mental representations and deduce the other person's emotional state. These results suggest that impaired empathy in individuals with Asperger syndrome may be due to impaired integration of the cognitive and affective facets of the other person's mental state.","Although face recognition deficits in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome (AS), are widely acknowledged, the empirical evidence is mixed. This in part reflects the failure to use standardized and psychometrically sound tests. We contrasted standardized face recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) for 34 individuals with AS with those for 42, IQ-matched non-ASD individuals, and age-standardized scores from a large Australian cohort. We also examined the influence of IQ, autistic traits, and negative affect on face recognition performance. Overall, participants with AS performed significantly worse on the CFMT than the non-ASD participants and when evaluated against standardized test norms. However, while 24% of participants with AS presented with severe face recognition impairment (>2 SDs below the mean), many individuals performed at or above the typical level for their age: 53% scored within +/- 1 SD of the mean and 9% demonstrated superior performance (>1 SD above the mean). Regression analysis provided no evidence that IQ, autistic traits, or negative affect significantly influenced face recognition: diagnostic group membership was the only significant predictor of face recognition performance. In sum, face recognition performance in ASD is on a continuum, but with average levels significantly below non-ASD levels of performance.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger syndrome"" relates to descriptions of specific impairments or deficits associated with the condition, which is part of the broader Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Although the specific focus in each text differs (empathy deficits in Text A and face recognition deficits in Text B), both texts consistently present ""Asperger syndrome"" as a condition characterized by cognitive and emotional processing dysfunctions that significantly impact social interactions and perceptions. Moreover, several characteristics, including the recognition of Asperger syndrome as part of ASD and discussions around specific deficits (as opposed to a broad, non-specific discussion), appear consistent between the texts, suggesting there has been no significant semantic drift in the meaning or connotation of ""Asperger"" between the two periods."
23,Asperger,High-functioning individuals with autism (HFA) or Asperger's syndrome (AS) commonly report difficulties understanding speech in situations where there is background speech or noise. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to verify the validity of these reports; (2) to quantify the difficulties experienced; and (3) to propose possible mechanisms to explain the perceptual deficits described.,"The study starts with the hypothesis that the difficulty to identify and describe emotions and feelings, and to differentiate the feelings of bodily sensations that accompany them, are a common denominator of the construct of alexithymia and Asperger syndrome (AS).","###Answer:

- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" is used consistently to refer to Asperger syndrome (AS), a specific autism spectrum disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. In Text A, the focus is on the perceptual deficits experienced by individuals with Asperger's in noisy environments. Text B discusses challenges related to emotional identification and description in the context of Asperger's. While the specifics of the challenges discussed vary between the texts, the underlying use of ""Asperger"" to identify a set of behavioral and cognitive characteristics associated with this syndrome remains unchanged. Both texts treat Asperger syndrome as a defined clinical or psychological condition, indicating the consistency in the meaning and connotation of the term over time."
24,Asperger,"A recent finding that individuals with autism are not susceptible to illusions has been explained by Happé (1996) as a sign of ""weak central coherence"" at lower levels of processing. We investigated the phenomenon with a more sophisticated measure. In Experiment 1, individuals with autism, Asperger's syndrome, moderate learning difficulties, and typical development adjusted certain comparison lines and circles to make them appear to be the same size in four visual illusions. With a minor exception, the participants with autism and Asperger's syndrome evinced a systematic bias in their judgements in the illusion condition. The extent of this was no different from control participants. In a second experiment, a similar finding was obtained in a task where participants made verbal judgements about the stimuli. The results suggest that lower-level coherence in visual processing in autism is intact.","Autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) are characterised by impairments in social interaction, stereotypic behaviours or restricted interests. Although currently listed as distinct clinical disorders, the validity of their distinction remains controversial. This study examined gait in children with autism and AD. Eleven children with high-functioning autism and eleven children with AD completed a series of walking tasks. Results indicated distinct movement disturbance; these findings are discussed in light of seminal papers in this field by Vilensky et al. (Arch Neurol 38:646-649, 1981) and Hallett et al. (Arch Neurol 50:1304-1308, 1993) who interpret the gait of individuals with autism using parkinsonian and cerebellar-ataxia patient models, respectively. Distinctions in gait patterns implicating perhaps unique motor circuit disturbances support the hypothesis that autism and AD may have unique neurodevelopmental trajectories.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: The use of the term ""Asperger"" in both texts refers to one of the conditions within the autism spectrum, specifically designated by social interaction difficulties and restrictive, repetitive behaviors, alongside specific abilities and interests. In both Text A and Text B, Asperger's syndrome is discussed in the context of its similarities to and distinctions within the greater autism diagnosis spectrum. Text A focuses on cognitive aspects, examining visual processing and illusions in individuals with Asperger's syndrome alongside autism, suggesting intact lower-level coherence in visual processing. Text B investigates motor features in individuals with Asperger's and autism, analyzing gait patterns and proposing unique neurodevelopmental trajectories. Despite the different specific angles of research, both texts use ""Asperger"" to signify a form of autism spectrum disorder, with an emphasis on its unique characteristics but maintaining its identity within the broader autistic context. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in how ""Asperger"" is used between these two periods."
25,Asperger,"Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder belonging to autism spectrum disorders. Both children and adults with AS have subjective impairment in the initiation and continuity of sleep, and studies using objective assessment are sparse. Twenty young AS adults with frequent complaints of low sleep quality were compared to 10 age-, gender- and education-matched controls without sleep complaints using polysomnography and spectral power analysis of slow-wave sleep. AS subjects displayed a similar polysomnographic profile as compared with controls. In spectral power analysis, a statistically nonsignificant trend towards decreased relative delta power and increased theta power in slow-wave sleep was found in the AS group. It seems that nonorganic insomnia, due to anxiety inherent in AS, is responsible for the low sleep quality in these subjects.","While motor clumsiness is frequently described as an associated feature of Asperger's Disorder, little research has examined specific motor skills and the relation among aspects of motor performance in this population. The present purpose was to present preliminary findings for three aspects of Asperger's: the presence and magnitude of gross motor and fine motor deficits, the presence and magnitude of visuomotor deficits, and the relation between motor functioning and visuomotor skills. 17 boys, 6 to 13 years old, with Asperger's were tested using standardized measures of gross, fine, and visuomotor skills. Statistically significant deficits were found for the sample's scores compared with values for the general population (using one-sample t tests), but none for fine motor vs gross motor skills (using a dependent sample t test). Significant positive correlations were found for gross motor skills with visuomotor skills (.73) and for fine motor skills with visuomotor skills (.71). Tentative suggestions for clinical assessment were proposed.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The term ""Asperger"" in both Text A and Text B relates to Asperger syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that is part of autism spectrum disorders. 

- In Text A, the study is focused on sleep quality issues among young adults with Asperger syndrome, exploring issues of insomnia related to anxiety inherent in the disorder.
- In Text B, the study examines motor skills and visuomotor deficits in children with Asperger's, acknowledging the presence of motor clumsiness as a common feature in the disorder and exploring relationships between different types of motor skills.

In both cases, the term ""Asperger"" is utilized within the context of describing a form of autism characterized by specific behavioral and functional impairments, even though the specific attributes studied (sleep quality in Text A and motor skills in Text B) are different. There is no significant shift in the fundamental perception or characterization of Asperger syndrome between the two texts; it remains a disorder within the autism spectrum with a focus on distinct symptomatic areas in different studies. Hence, the meaning or connotation of the term ""Asperger"" appears consistent between the two periods, focusing on its medical and psychological implications without any notable semantic drift."
26,Asperger,"ASPERGER (1963) mentioned as a very important etiological aspect of anorexia nervosa a desintegration of intellectual and thymical functions causing the fact, that these patients are not able to accept the role of an adult, especially that one of a woman. We discuss that statment in connexion with ERIKSON'S (1974) concept about ""ego-identity"" (""Ich-Identitat"") and ""negative-identity"" (""negative Identitat""). The pathological family-structure seems to reinforce the situation and the existence of inadequate behavior of patients with anorexia nervosa, who are often introverted and predestinated for conditioning. The therapy of these patients should focuse on the development of ego-identity, including the treatment of the family members, the modification of the inadapted behavior and a special endocrinological therapy.","It has been proposed that the biological basis of autism spectrum disorder includes cerebellar 'disconnection'. However, direct in vivo evidence in support of this is lacking. Here, the microstructural integrity of cerebellar white matter in adults with Asperger syndrome was studied using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance tractography. Fifteen adults with Asperger syndrome and 16 age-IQ-gender-matched healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. For each subject, tract-specific measurements of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were made within the inferior, middle, superior cerebellar peduncles and short intracerebellar fibres. No group differences were observed in mean diffusivity. However, people with Asperger syndrome had significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the short intracerebellar fibres (p<0.001) and right superior cerebellar (output) peduncle (p<0.001) compared to controls; but no difference in the input tracts. Severity of social impairment, as measured by the Autistic Diagnostic Interview, was negatively correlated with diffusion anisotropy in the fibres of the left superior cerebellar peduncle. These findings suggest a vulnerability of specific cerebellar neural pathways in people with Asperger syndrome. The localised abnormalities in the main cerebellar outflow pathway may prevent the cerebral cortex from receiving those cerebellar feedback inputs necessary for a successful adaptive social behaviour.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The term ""Asperger"" in both texts refers unabridgedly to Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum. No significant change in the connotation or fundamental description of Asperger syndrome is evident between the two uses.

- Text A from 1963 and related discussions from the 1970s discuss Asperger in the realm of etiology concerning psychological and behavioral aspects linked with anorexia nervosa. Although the term here is nested within a complex psychological discussion involving ego identity and family dynamics, its core recognition as a part of the broader autism spectrum is implicit.

- Text B from a more recent period elaborates on biological and neuroimaging studies concerning individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, focusing on cerebellar differences and their implications for social behaviors, which directly ties into its place on the autism spectrum.

Both texts retain the association of ""Asperger"" with a broader neurodevelopmental context, specifically focusing on nuanced impacts on behavior and neurological underpinnings rather than any fundamental shift in understanding or linkages to unrelated conditions or concepts. The usage of the term remains anchored to its association with the autism spectrum across both periods, reflecting a consistent meaning over time."
27,Asperger,"This qualitative study aimed to develop an understanding of the challenges faced by teenage boys with Asperger syndrome and their mothers. A case study approach was used to collect data from two 13-year-old boys who have Asperger syndrome and their mothers in Queensland, Australia. Data were collected through the use of semistructured interviews. The words of the boys and their mothers provide a valuable insight into the personal experiences and feelings of the participants. An inductive approach to data analysis identified four themes: (1) developmental differences; (2) problems associated with the general characteristics of Asperger syndrome (i.e. communication and social difficulties, restricted range of interests, a need for routine); (3) stress; and (4) 'masquerading'. The first three themes relate strongly to the current literature, but the emergence of masquerading is of particular interest in developing a fuller understanding of the experiences of individuals with Asperger syndrome at school.","The prevalence of sleep disturbances in 52 children with Asperger syndrome (AS) as compared with 61 healthy controls (all subjects aged 5-17 years) was investigated. Problems with sleep onset and maintenance, sleep-related fears, negative attitudes toward sleeping, and daytime somnolence were more frequent among children with AS than among controls. Short sleep duration (<9 h) was almost twofold (59% vs. 32%), and the risk for sleep onset problems more than fivefold (53% vs. 10%) more common in the AS group than in the control group. Child-reported sleeping problems were also more prevalent in the AS group than in controls (58% vs. 7%). The results suggest that sleep disturbances should be routinely evaluated in children with AS.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A from an earlier period and Text B from a later period, the target word ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum characterized by social and communication difficulties along with restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors. Text A discusses various life challenges, including social and communication problems, faced by those with Asperger syndrome. Text B also touches upon additional difficulties such as sleep disturbances common among children with Asperger syndrome but maintains the core recognition of it as a developmental disorder. Despite the focus on different aspects in each text, the fundamental understanding and characterization of Asperger syndrome remain consistent over time, showing no significant semantic drift in the use of the term “Asperger.”"
28,Asperger,"Two groups of individuals, one with high-functioning autism and the other with Asperger syndrome were tested using Happé's Strange Stories Test of a more advanced theory of mind (Happé, 1994). This assesses the ability to interpret a nonliteral statement. Relative to normal controls who were IQ and age-matched, individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome performed less well on the task, while performing normally on a non-mentalistic control task. Individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome could provide mental state answers, but had difficulty in providing contextually appropriate mental state answers. Rather, their answers tended to concentrate on the utterance in isolation. This replicates Happé's result. Although the majority of both clinical groups provided context-inappropriate interpretations, the autism group had the greater difficulty. Results are discussed in relation to both weak central coherence and theory of mind.","Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging method to quantify biochemical metabolites in vivo and it can serve as a powerful tool to monitor neurobiochemical profiles in the brain. Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a type of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired social skills and restrictive, repetitive patterns of interest and activities, while intellectual levels and language skills are relatively preserved. Despite clinical aspects have been well-characterized, neurometabolic profiling in the brain of AS remains to be clear. The present study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to investigate whether pediatric AS is associated with measurable neurometabolic abnormalities that can contribute new information on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the word ""Asperger"" (or its variant ""Asperger's syndrome"") consistently refers to a type of autism spectrum disorder characterized by specific cognitive and behavioral patterns. Text A discusses Asperger syndrome in a psychological testing context, noting its effects on theory of mind and contextual understanding among individuals. Text B uses the term ""Asperger's syndrome"" while detailing a study on neurobiochemical profiles using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, still highlighting its characterization as part of the autism spectrum with preserved intellectual levels and specific impairments. In both texts, despite the different focuses (psychological vs. neurobiochemical), the underlying definition and description of Asperger (or Asperger's syndrome) as a form of autism with particular traits remains consistent. Therefore, the semantic usage of ""Asperger"" has not significantly changed between the texts."
29,Asperger,"Individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS), a high functioning variant of Autism, are often noted to possess intact language ability, yet fail to use this language capacity to engage in interactive communication. This difficulty using language in a social context has been referred to as a deficit in pragmatic language. In particular, difficulty understanding nonliteral language devices, such as irony has been observed. This paper examines the veracity of two theories that have attempted to explain the causes of pragmatic language difficulties in individuals with Asperger Syndrome; the theory of Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and Social Inference theory. Fourteen young adults with AS and 24 age-matched controls were assessed on cognitive tasks measuring WCC processes, social inference or Theory of Mind ability, and the ability to interpret ironic remarks. Results indicated that the ability to understand the belief states of others is critical to understanding ironic language in AS.","Hans Asperger is probably best known for Asperger syndrome. However, he has been accused of knowingly and willingly participating in the National Socialist Child Euthanasia programme by referring patients to the Am Spiegelgrund children's home in Vienna. This later became notorious for euthanising disabled children. We investigated those allegations.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In the given texts, we observe a significant change in the use and connotation of the term ""Asperger."" Text A addresses Asperger Syndrome (AS) as a specific clinical and psychological condition that lies within the autism spectrum disorder, focusing on cognitive and social aspects, particularly the challenges of using language in social contexts and understanding irony. This text reflects a medical and behavioral analysis of the condition.

In contrast, Text B explores a historical and ethical examination of Hans Asperger himself, notably his alleged involvement with the National Socialist Child Euthanasia program. The term ""Asperger"" in this context refers more to the historical figure and his actions rather than to the syndrome that bears his name. This represents a distinct shift from a clinical discussion to an ethical and historical critique associated with the individual, shifting the focus from a medical condition to historical controversies involving the person who initially described the syndrome.

This significant divergence in context and implications associated with the term ""Asperger"" marks a clear semantic drift from Text A's clinical use to Text B's historical and ethical considerations. Hence, the term has undergone notable semantic change in its usage and connotations over time."
30,Asperger,"In the present paper the evidence for Field Marshal Montgomery having Asperger's syndrome is examined. Biographies of Montgomery were examined to search for evidence that he met criteria for Asperger's syndrome - Gillberg (1991) and Asperger's disorder (APA.1994) and Anankastic personality disorder (WHO,1992). He demonstrates a qualitative impairment in social interaction and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities. It can be concluded that he met criteria for Asperger's disorder DSM-IV (APA.1994).","The aim of this study was to identify the outcomes expected and assessed by those providing service dogs to children with developmental disabilities. Seventeen registered service dog providers were invited to complete a mixed methods online survey. Five providers, who prepared dogs to work with a wide range of conditions and behaviours, mainly Asperger's syndrome, autism and communication disorders, completed the survey. All five participants reported that they expected to see positive changes as a consequence of the service dog placement, in both the recipient child and their family, including improvements in attention span and language skills, as well as increased familial cohesion. Survey responses indicated that not all desired outcomes were routinely assessed. The range of assessments used were interviews, intake conversations, pre-placement questionnaires, child social diaries filled in by parents, follow up surveys after placement, and child observation by parents. No specifically named valid and reliable clinical or research measures were referred to, showing an emphasis on assessments from parents and service dog providers. It is not clear whether pre-intervention assessments are repeated systematically at follow-up, which could show robust intervention effects. There is scope for professionals in developmental disability to work with service dog providers to improve the evidence base in this field.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""Asperger"" refers specifically to Asperger's syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Text A focuses on a historical analysis attempting to diagnose a historical figure retrospectively with Asperger's syndrome, using established criteria from diagnostic manuals. Text B discusses the use of service dogs to assist children with developmental disorders including Asperger's syndrome, showcasing an application of understanding and accommodating the condition in a practical, supportive context. Despite the different applications of the term, the core reference to the disorder remains consistent between both texts, indicating no significant semantic drift in the term ""Asperger"" from a diagnostic label to its application in therapeutic contexts."
31,Asperger,"An emerging literature on the neuroanatomical correlates of social cognition in pervasive developmental disorders is reviewed. Studies conducted with high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger's syndrome highlight patterns of decreased activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, amygdala, and periamygdaloid cortex, along with aberrantly increased activation in primary sensory cortices. Future studies should extend these important initial results to younger and more severely affected subjects.","From the 1970s on, case studies reported the effectiveness of therapeutic mirroring in movement with children with autism spectrum disorder. In this feasibility study, we tested a dance movement therapy intervention based on mirroring in movement in a population of 31 young adults with autism spectrum disorder (mainly high-functioning and Asperger's syndrome) with the aim to increase body awareness, social skills, self-other distinction, empathy, and well-being. We employed a manualized dance movement therapy intervention implemented in hourly sessions once a week for 7 weeks. The treatment group (n = 16) and the no-intervention control group (n = 15) were matched by sex, age, and symptom severity. Participants did not participate in any other therapies for the duration of the study. After the treatment, participants in the intervention group reported improved well-being, improved body awareness, improved self-other distinction, and increased social skills. The dance movement therapy-based mirroring approach seemed to address more primary developmental aspects of autism than the presently prevailing theory-of-mind approach. Results suggest that dance movement therapy can be an effective and feasible therapy approach for autism spectrum disorder, while future randomized control trials with bigger samples are needed. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" (or ""Asperger's syndrome"") is used to refer to a specific group within the broader category of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both texts continue to highlight the use of this term in the context of research and interventions designed to improve cognitive and social functions in individuals diagnosed with this condition. Text A discusses neurological studies and activation patterns associated with Asperger's syndrome, emphasizing its distinct neuroanatomical features within the autism spectrum. Text B investigates the efficacy of therapeutic interventions like dance movement therapy specifically in individuals labeled with Asperger's syndrome, noting improvements in social skills and well-being. Hence, the use of ""Asperger"" maintains its clinical and diagnostic connotation as a specific manifestation within the autism spectrum in both texts, indicating no significant semantic drift over time regarding the term's meaning and use within academic and clinical contexts."
32,Asperger,"Asperger's disorder or syndrome is characterized by impaired social interaction, normal intelligence, and adequate language skills in the areas of grammar and vocabulary. The symptoms are pervasive in nature and usually manifested in childhood. Despite the gravity and chronicity of the condition, the medical literature remains sparse and offers no information about possible neuropathologic underpinnings. The present study is a case report on two patients with Asperger's syndrome. Neuropathologic examination revealed no degenerative changes or gliosis. A more detailed assessment with computerized image analysis indicated abnormalities in the minicolumnar organization of the three areas examined (9, 21, 22) (P = .032). Specifically, minicolumns were smaller, and their component cells were more dispersed than normal. A similar neuropathology has recently been reported for autism and disputes the uniqueness of these findings. The minicolumnar changes provide a possible link to receptive field abnormalities and a useful clinicopathologic correlate to Asperger's syndrome.","The Test of Language Competence-Expanded Edition (TLC-E) was administered to children and adults with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Relative to controls, those with ASD were less competent on a range of TLC-E tasks. No differences were found for either child or adult ASD groups on any of the TLC-E measures when re-classified as Asperger syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA) using DSM-IV language criterion. Hierarchical cluster analyses of individuals with ASD identified subgroups within the spectrum. The use of developmental language history as an identifying marker in autism is questioned. The findings suggest that comprehensive language assessments on individuals with ASD can provide clinically relevant information regarding the heterogeneity of language skills within the autistic spectrum.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
The analysis of the term ""Asperger"" between Text A and Text B indicates a significant shift in its contextual use and conceptual understanding, suggesting a change in semantic drift.

In Text A, ""Asperger"" is treated as a distinct syndrome or disorder (referred to as ""Asperger's syndrome"" or ""Asperger's disorder"") characterizing specific symptoms like impaired social interaction, normal intelligence, and adequate language skills, mainly manifesting in childhood. The description separates Asperger's from other conditions and provides a detailed neuropathologic examination to underpin this differentiation.

In Text B, the term ""Asperger"" is used in comparison with broader categorizations in ""autism spectrum disorder (ASD)."" The term is applied interchangeably with ""high functioning autism (HFA)"" under the umbrella of ASD, demonstrating an evolution from seeing Asperger's as a distinct disorder to a condition within a broader spectrum. Additionally, the use of DSM-IV language criteria to reclassify individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) into ASD suggests a shift in diagnostic approach and understanding towards a more integrated view within the autism spectrum.

This merging of Asperger's into a larger diagnostic category (ASD) illustrates a significant semantic drift in the use of the term from a distinct syndrome to a subset within a broader spectrum, aligning with changes in diagnostic standards and perceptions in the field of psychiatry and psychology."
33,Asperger,"We tested whether dimensional measures of empathic ability, theory of mind, and intelligence would differentiate autism spectrum disorders from each other and from non-spectrum disorders. Tests were administered to children with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (AutD; n = 20), Asperger's Disorder (AspD; n = 28), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Inattentive Type) (ADHD; n = 35), Mental Retardation (Mild) (MR; n = 34), Anxiety Disorder (AnxD; n = 14), or No Psychological Disorder (NPD; n = 36). Results showed that empathic ability discriminated among groups on the autism spectrum (AutD < AspD < NPD). Because empathic ability is not independent of intelligence (AutD < AspD < NPD on intelligence; MR < ADHD < NPD on empathic ability), both dimensions are necessary to discriminate autism spectrum from non-spectrum disorders. When intelligence is covaried, empathic ability discriminated AutD, but not AspD, from other disorders (AutD < MR < ADHD < NPD = AnxD = AspD).","Using a key word search on electronic databases, two relevant journals and relevant review references, four measures of autistic symptoms (Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test, Autism Behavior Checklist, Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale) were reviewed with reference to their ability to discriminate the three major components of autism and measure across the whole spectrum of autism. None of the reviewed measures were able to effectively tap into and differentiate between all points on the spectrum. Further work is required to assess the sensitivity of the measures to independence between domains. The development of a measure sensitive to symptom change/continuity across development may be useful.","###Answer:

- Label: Changed

- Reason: The usage and context of the word ""Asperger"" in Text A and Text B demonstrate a noticeable shift in how it is understood and discussed within the field of developmental and psychological disorders. In Text A (which is likely from a time when Asperger's Disorder was considered a distinct diagnosis under autism spectrum disorders), ""Asperger"" refers to a specific category of autism spectrum disorder, differentiated from other types such as Autistic Disorder (AutD) based on criteria like empathic ability and intelligence. However, in Text B, the broader term ""autism"" and ""spectrum"" are used more generically, without highlighting ""Asperger"" as a distinct category, reflecting the shift in diagnostic criteria where the distinction between Asperger's Disorder and other forms of autism has become less pronounced and is no longer officially recognized as a separate disorder in the latest diagnostic manuals (like DSM-5, implemented since 2013). This change in usage illustrates a semantic drift where ""Asperger"" is increasingly embedded and undifferentiated within the broader autism spectrum terminology."
34,Asperger,"Investigated the use of cohesive links to create a reciprocal conversation in individuals with autism, Asperger syndrome, and a control group of children and adolescents with nonspecific social problems. All subjects engaged in a 10-minute conversation with an examiner that touched on various topics. The conversation was audiotaped, transcribed, and coded blindly for several types of cohesive links. Compared to controls, the higher functioning autistic group referred less to a previous stretch of the conversation and more to an aspect of the physical environment. The Asperger group, on the other hand, was very similar to the controls except they made more unclear references that were difficult to interpret. Implications of these findings for understanding the communicative failure of subjects with pervasive developmental disorder are discussed.","In a longitudinal study, the authors explore the course of general cognition in anorexia nervosa (AN) over time and compare general cognitive problems, executive function deficits, attentional problems and visuomotor dysfunctions across AN individuals and healthy controls. A community-based sample of adolescent onset AN cases (n=40-47) was contrasted with an age-, sex- and school matched comparison group (n=47-51) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Luria word recall test at a mean age of 24 years. Only two of the cases tested were underweight at the time of the study. The Wechsler scale had also been administered when the groups had a mean age of 21 years. There were few differences across the two groups even though the comparison group performed significantly better on the Object Assembly subtest of the WAIS-R. IQ increased slightly but significantly over time in both groups. There was no relationship between level of starvation and poor results on tests in the AN group. A subgroup of the subjects had autism spectrum disorders. In this subgroup there were cases with test profiles similar to those observed in autism and Asperger syndrome, just as there had been on testing three years previously. Ten years after AN onset, the former AN cases showed no major neuropsychological deficits. A subgroup with autistic features had test profiles similar to those observed in autism spectrum disorders. The AN group as a whole showed poor results on the object assembly subtest indicating weak central coherence with a tendency to focus on details at the expense of configural information. This cognitive style may account for their obsession with details, with implications for psychoeducational approaches in treatment programmes/interventions.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" is used similarly, identifying a subset of individuals grouped under autism spectrum disorders characterized by specific cognitive and communicative patterns. In Text A, Asperger is referred to in the context of studying communicational challenges and nuances in comparison with other groups. Text B mentions Asperger syndrome while discussing cognitive test profiles in a subgroup of autism spectrum disorders, linking it to specific patterns observed in neuropsychological assessments. Both texts use the term ""Asperger"" to describe a particular form of autism spectrum disorder without deviating significantly in the fundamental understanding of its behavioral patterns and cognitive characteristics. Thus, the semantic use of ""Asperger"" remains consistent across the two texts, indicating no significant drift in meaning over time."
35,Asperger,"We investigated a male, aged 4 years 11 months, who fulfilled the criteria of Asperger syndrome). In addition to the typical pattern of autistic symptoms, psychological testing revealed prosopagnosia in tasks for face recognition and matching. Prosopagnosia was also present when he tried to identify the faces of his parents and himself in photographs whenever these were presented with photographs of other persons. Although impairment in reciprocal social interaction in individuals with Asperger syndrome is closely correlated to their impaired perceptional abilities in non-verbal communication, especially facial expression, overt prosopagnosia seems to be a rare neuropsychological symptom in persons with autistic disorders.","In 2008, we launched a new outpatient clinic and day care service designed exclusively for adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger syndrome"" retains its use within the context of describing a specific type of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterized by high functioning and specific cognitive and social challenges. Text A describes a detailed case study involving a young individual diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, focusing on their social interaction impairments and prosopagnosia, a common symptom in autism spectrum disorders. Text B discusses a medical setup specializing in patients with ASD, including Asperger syndrome. Here, the focus is on neuroimaging studies and brain functionality, but still framed within the context of the disorder's unique attributes such as normal or high intelligence and specific social and cognitive aspects. Both texts, from different periods and with different emphases, maintain a congruent understanding of Asperger syndrome as a distinct and diagnosable condition within the autism spectrum, indicating that the semantic meaning of 'Asperger' has not significantly drifted over time in the provided contexts."

We examined the ability of auditory evoked magnetic fields to predict language and other developmental abilities in children and adolescents. Following standardized assessment of language ability, nonverbal IQ, and autism-associated behaviors, 110 trails of a tone were binaurally presented to 45 7-18 year olds who had typical development, autism (with LI), Asperger Syndrome (i.e., without LI), or SLI. Using a 151-channel MEG system, latency of left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) auditory M50 and M100 peaks was recorded. RH M50 latency (and to a lesser extent, RH M100 latency) predicted overall oral language ability, accounting for 36% of the variance. Nonverbal IQ and autism behavior ratings were not predicted by any of the evoked fields. Latency of the RH M50 was the best predictor of clinical LI (i.e., irrespective of autism diagnosis), and demonstrated 82% accuracy in predicting Receptive LI; a cutoff of 84.6 ms achieved 92% specificity and 70% sensitivity in classifying children with and without Receptive LI. Auditory evoked responses appear to reflect language functioning and impairment rather than non-specific brain (dys)function (e.g., IQ, behavior). RH M50 latency proved to be a relatively useful indicator of impaired language comprehension, suggesting that delayed auditory perceptual processing in the RH may be a key neural dysfunction underlying the overlap between subgroups of children with autism and SLI.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
  In both Text A and Text B from different years, the usage of the word ""Asperger"" appears to denote a specific condition within the autism spectrum without evidence of significant semantic change. In Text A, the focus is on employing a therapeutic intervention (Social Story) tailored for a student with Asperger syndrome, highlighting specific behavioral modifications related to daily activities. Text B examines the differences and similarities in auditory evoked responses among groups, including those diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, providing a clinical perspective on neurological and behavioral distinctions within autism and related disorders.

  The usage in both texts aligns with understanding Asperger Syndrome as a distinct category or subgroup within the broader autistic spectrum, primarily characterized by challenges in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside repetitive patterns of behavior and interests, without a mention of language impairment (as opposed to other forms of autism). The fundamental depiction of Asperger as a specific type of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains consistent, with both texts exploring different aspects of managing or understanding the condition from a medical, psychological, or educational perspective. Hence, the semantic meaning of the word ""Asperger"" holds consistent across the years, indicating no significant drift."
37,Asperger,"Autism and Asperger syndrome (ASP) are neurobiological conditions with overlapping behavioral symptoms and of unknown etiologies. Results from previous autism neuroimaging studies have been difficult to replicate, possibly owing to site differences in subject samples, scanning procedures, and image-processing methods. We sought (1) to determine whether low-functioning autism (LFA; IQ<70), high-functioning autism (HFA; IQ>or=70), and ASP constitute distinct biological entities as evidenced by neuroanatomical measures, and (2) to assess for intersite differences.","Autism spectrum disorders (autism, Asperger's syndrome, high-functioning autism) are characterized by a common pattern of marked impairments in social interactions. Deficits have been described in face processing, facial emotion recognition, and social attribution (""theory of mind"") or generally speaking in social cognition. Some studies have shown that these impairments are already detectable in early childhood, leading to the assumption that the underlying cause is an early disruption of neuronal development. Accordingly, neuroimaging data have revealed alterations of structure and function in the brains of autistic children, adolescents, and adults. The present review gives a systematic overview of the existing literature on functional imaging studies using experimental paradigms of social cognition, i.e. face discrimination, facial emotion recognition, and theory of mind in autistic disorders.","### Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" specifically refers to Asperger syndrome, commonly understood as part of the autism spectrum disorders characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Text A deals with Asperger syndrome in the context of differentiating it from other forms of autism based on IQ and neuroanatomical measures. Text B contextualizes Asperger's along with other autism spectrum disorders, emphasizing impairments mainly related to social cognition and their detection through neuroimaging studies in social cognition. The essential reference to Asperger’s syndrome as a specific facet within the broader autism spectrum, marked by distinct neurodevelopmental and social interaction patterns, remains consistent between the texts. Thus, the semantic meaning associated with the term ""Asperger"" has not undergone significant changes over the period between these texts. Both texts use it to refer to a form of autism with particular characteristics without drifting into a fundamentally different interpretation."
38,Asperger,"The current status of autism studies was reviewed based on English articles published during the 1990s. Although the concepts of autism and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are established, diagnostic criteria of PDDNOS or atypical autism, which is frequently difficult to differentiate from autism, need to be established. The prevalence of autism has been estimated as about 0.05% in the U.S and many European countries, while it was reported to be 0.1% or higher in Japan and some European countries, though the reasons for this difference are unclear. High-functioning (IQ > or = 70) autism may not be as rare a condition as previously thought and both its difference from and similarity to Asperger's syndrome, the highest functioning PDD subtype, need clarification. About 20 to 40% of children with autism lose meaningful words by the age of 2 years and display autistic symptoms thereafter. Such autism, called the setback type in Japan, has been demonstrated to have a poorer adolescent/adult outcome compared to autism without setback and its relationship with childhood disintegrative disorder, which displays a clearer regression after normal development for at least the first 2 years of life, needs to be addressed. The etiology of autism is now considered mostly genetic for reasons, such as the significantly higher concordance rate of autism in identical twin pairs (60-80%) than in fraternal twin pairs (0-10%) and an 3-5% incidence of autism among sibs of an autism proband, 30 to 100 times higher than that in the general population. The involvement of several genes is implicated to create susceptibility for autism, yet the responsible genes have not been identified. Although there is no medication to cure autism, some psychotropic drugs, such as antipsychotics and SSRIs, seem effective for behavior problems in autism patients. Psychosocial treatments are the main therapeutic approach to autism, though they are yet to be well systematized. It is important to evaluate various autism treatments now practiced and to integrate effective ones into an efficient therapeutic system. Early diagnosis of PDD, support for the mother to develop a better relationship with her autistic infant, enrollment of an autistic infant in a day care for handicapped or non-handicapped infants, education in a relevant school, vocational training, treatment of behavior problems, and establishing social welfare services are a framework of the therapeutic system of autism. Much should be done to improve the long-term outcome of autism patients, including high-functioning autism.","In this study, three hundred and sixty-eight participants answered a questionnaire consisting of three vignettes describing a person with depression, severe Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder/Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Each vignette was followed by thirteen questions concerning the participant's knowledge about diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Participants demonstrated good mental health literacy (MHL) for depression, but were poor at diagnosing ASD. Drug therapy was rated as the least effective treatment and 'talking to a family member of friend' was rated as the most effective for each disorder. The highest prognosis ratings were given to depression, and the lowest given to ASD. Participants demonstrated better MHL than expected, possibly due to the availability of information on the Internet and the increase in prevalence of mental illnesses such as depression and ASD among the general population.","###Answer:
- Target word: Asperger
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" is used to refer to a form of high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder. Text A discusses Asperger's syndrome as a subtype of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) that needs further differentiation from other forms of autism, noting that it is considered the highest functioning subtype of PDD. Text B refers to Asperger's Syndrome within the context of high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which aligns with Text A’s description in terms of portraying it as a comparatively mild or high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Despite the evolving nature of diagnostic criteria and understanding of autism-related conditions, the essential characteristic of Asperger's as a high-functioning autism condition remains consistent between the two texts from different periods. Thus, the term ""Asperger"" has not undergone a significant semantic shift in medical or popular understanding as evidenced by its use in these contexts, hence it is labeled as ""Unchanged""."
39,Asperger,"A meta-analysis was performed on the 133 cognitive and behavioral papers in autism using comparison groups in the 1999-2002 period. High-functioning (average IQ: 84.7), adolescents (average, 14.4 years) are largely dominant. IQ is the most frequent matching variable in use (51.2%). The instruments that are most frequently used to determine IQ or general level are Wechsler scales (46.9%), British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS; 22.3%), and Raven Progressive Matrices (RPM; 16.9%). In order to determine if these instruments were equivalent when applied to individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), Wechsler IQ, EVIP (a French Canadian translation of the BPVS), and RPM were given to a group of 14 individuals with autism and 12 with Asperger syndrome. Comparison of Wechsler and RPM IQs values, expressed as percentiles, to percentile values of EVIP score revealed that EVIP (and to a lesser extent RPM) considerably overestimates the level of all PDD participants as compared to Wechsler Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), or Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), whereas these instruments are reported to be strongly correlated in typically developing individuals. This study reveals that identification of objects from a verbal label--the BPVS-PPVT-EVIP task--is a peak of ability in high functioning individuals with PDDs. This peak of ability, even superior to that of block design, has a detrimental effect on matching based on this instrument. A recommendation to replace BPVS/PPVT/EVIP or RPM by Wechsler scale as a basis of IQ/level matching is provided. Accordingly, the former instruments are a potential source of type-1 (for cognitive deficits) or type-2 (for cognitive hyperfunctioning) errors.","The prevalence of Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism, appears to be rapidly increasing. This developmental disorder affects children and adults and can present challenges to providing medical care. In this update on Asperger syndrome, we offer guidance on how to interact with adult patients with the disorder. We also address proposed diagnostic changes scheduled to take effect in 2013.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: 
In Text A, ""Asperger"" is discussed in a highly technical, clinical context focusing on cognitive and behavioral aspects when comparing with other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which includes detailed assessments through various psychological measurement tools. This highlights a strict clinical and cognitive evaluation perspective within a research framework around the year 2002.

In contrast, Text B reflects a broader socio-medical perspective on Asperger syndrome, emphasizing its increasing prevalence and the challenges it poses in medical and social care settings. The focus here shifts away from the narrow clinical cognitive assessments to a more integrated understanding of the disorder's impact on daily life and social interactions, preparing for changes in diagnostic criteria. This text from around 2013 shows a semantic broadening and a shift towards practical management and interaction guidelines in medical and social environments.

Thus, the use of the term ""Asperger"" seems to have expanded from a strictly defined clinical diagnostic category to include broader socio-medical implications and considerations, indicating significant semantic drift."
40,Asperger,"Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, and Clubley (2001) constructed brief, self-administered instruments named the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a Japanese version of this new instrument. Three groups of Japanese subjects were assessed. Group 1 (n = 57) consisted of adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA). The other two groups were control groups. Subjects of Group 2 (n = 194) were normal adults and those of Group 3 (n = 1 050) were students selected from five Universities in Tokyo and Chiba. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 37.9 (SD = 5.31), which was significantly higher than the two control groups (Group 2: X = 18.5, SD = 6.21, and Group 3: X = 20.7, SD = 6.38). While eighty-eight percent of the adults with AS/HFA scored more than 33 points, only 3% of subjects in the two control groups indicated those points. Among the controls, males scored slightly but significantly higher than females. The reliability of the AQ in both test-retest and inter-rater measures were significantly high.",Higher education requires more than academic skills and everyday student-life can be stressful.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger Syndrome (AS)"" refers to a condition that is part of the autism spectrum, characterized by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Text A provides a detailed account of quantitative assessment of these traits in adults recognized to have AS or high-functioning autism, while Text B mentions the need for support due to difficulties in social functioning among students with Asperger syndrome. Both texts focus on the social interaction challenges, a consistent and defining aspect of Asperger syndrome, indicating that the use and meaning of the word ""Asperger"" have remained largely unchanged."
41,Asperger,"Thirteen children and adolescents with diagnoses of Asperger syndrome (AS) were matched with 13 nonautistic control children on chronological age and verbal IQ. They were tested on their ability to recognize simple facial emotions, as well as facial emotions paired with matching, mismatching, or irrelevant verbal labels. There were no differences between the groups at recognizing simple emotions but the Asperger group performed significantly worse than the control group at recognizing emotions when faces were paired with mismatching words (but not with matching or irrelevant words). The results suggest that there are qualitative differences from nonclinical populations in how children with AS process facial expressions. When presented with a more demanding affective processing task, individuals with AS showed a bias towards visual-verbal over visual-affective information (i.e., words over faces). Thus, children with AS may be utilizing compensatory strategies, such as verbal mediation, to process facial expressions of emotion.","We developed a 28-item Chinese Eyes Test and tested its psychometric properties with a mixed sample of high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger syndrome and neurotypical adults. The Chinese Eyes Test showed good convergent and divergent validity, satisfactory known-group discrimination, and acceptable internal consistency. The identified cutoff score of 18 or below (Sensitivity: 66.7%; Specificity: 84.0%) should be useful for identifying clinically significant levels of social cognitive deficits, in terms of difficulty with the perceptual understanding of others' mental states, in high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger syndrome.","- Label: Unchanged

Both texts explore abilities or challenges specifically associated with Asperger syndrome, such as facial emotion recognition in Text A and the perceptual understanding of others' mental states in Text B. The fundamental conceptualization of Asperger syndrome as a form of autism spectrum disorder focused on specific cognitive and social characteristics remains consistent between the two periods. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the term's usage over the examined time frame."
42,Asperger,"To identify genetic loci for autism-spectrum disorders, we have performed a two-stage genomewide scan in 38 Finnish families. The detailed clinical examination of all family members revealed infantile autism, but also Asperger syndrome (AS) and developmental dysphasia, in the same set of families. The most significant evidence for linkage was found on chromosome 3q25-27, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 4.31 (Z(max )(dom)) for D3S3037, using infantile autism and AS as an affection status. Six markers flanking over a 5-cM region on 3q gave Z(max dom) >3, and a maximum parametric multipoint LOD score (MLS) of 4.81 was obtained in the vicinity of D3S3715 and D3S3037. Association, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analyses provided some evidence for shared ancestor alleles on this chromosomal region among affected individuals, especially in the regional subisolate. Additional potential susceptibility loci with two-point LOD scores >2 were observed on chromosomes 1q21-22 and 7q. The region on 1q21-22 overlaps with the previously reported candidate region for infantile autism and schizophrenia, whereas the region on chromosome 7q provided evidence for linkage 58 cM distally from the previously described autism susceptibility locus (AUTS1).","There are still no good quantitative methods to be applied in psychiatric diagnosis.

- Reason:
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" (or ""Asperger's disorder"" in Text B) refers to a specific category within the broader spectrum of autism-related disorders. Text A discusses social communication interventions appropriate for students with Asperger syndrome, identifying it as a subset of autism requiring tailored educational approaches. Text B places Asperger's disorder within the spectrum of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), indicating that it is one of several disorders characterized by specific impairments in communication, social interaction, and behavior.

  In both texts, the context suggests that ""Asperger"" is used to describe a form of autism with specific characteristics, without significant changes in connotation or implication between the two time periods. Both texts emphasize specialized approaches or understanding for those with Asperger's as part of the broader discussion about autism, maintaining a consistent clinical and developmental perspective on the disorder."
44,Asperger,"Two experiments compared incidental (implicit) and intentional (explicit) memory performance in adults with Asperger's syndrome and individually matched controls. Experiment 1 involved perceptual tests using word fragment cues, following study tasks in which the participants either generated the words from contextual cues or read the words alone, with no contextual cues. Experiment 2 involved conceptual tests using paired associate cues, following study tasks in which the paired associates were rated either for their relatedness or for their readability. Performance in both the incidental tests was similar for both groups. Performance in both the intentional tests was also similar for both groups, with one exception. The adults with Asperger's syndrome were more likely to falsely recall words that had not actually been studied. These findings further delimit the nature of memory impairments in adults with Asperger's syndrome, which seem restricted to certain aspects of episodic memory that include the tendency to make more intrusion errors in recall.","Childhood maltreatment is known to increase the risk of future psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we explored the impact of experienced maltreatment on the prevalence and comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in a high-risk population of adolescents in residential care units. We also studied the impact of poly-victimization. The participants of the study were adolescents in residential care units in Norway (n=335, mean age 16.8 years, girls 58.5%). A diagnostic interview (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment Interview) was used, yielding information about previous maltreatment (witnessing violence, victim of family violence, community violence, sexual abuse) and DSM-IV diagnoses present in the last three months. Exposure to maltreatment was reported by 71%, and in this group, we found significantly more Asperger's syndrome (AS) (p=.041), conduct disorder (CD) (p=.049), major depressive disorder (MDD) (p=.001), dysthymia (p=.030), general anxiety disorder (GAD) (p<.001), and having attempted suicide (p=.006). We found significantly more comorbid disorders in the maltreated group. Poly-victimization was studied by constructing a scale comprised of witnessing violence, victim of family violence, victim of sexual abuse and household dysfunction. We found that poly-victimization was associated with significantly increased risk of MDD, GAD, AS, CD, and having attempted suicide (p<.01). The complexity of the clinical outcomes revealed in this study suggest that longer-term treatment plans and follow-up by psychiatric services might be needed to a greater extend than for the rest of the child and adolescent population, and that trauma informed care is essential for adolescents in residential youth care. ","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In the given texts, the context and implications associated with the target word ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger's syndrome"" have shown a noticeable shift over the period between Text A and Text B. In Text A, Asperger's syndrome is discussed primarily in terms of cognitive and memory-based research, where the condition is looked at under a scientific and somewhat neutral experimental lens, examining specific memory functionalities in adults diagnosed with the condition. The context is clinical and focuses on understanding cognitive attributes or deficiencies related to Asperger's syndrome without any explicit negative or stigmatized connotations.

On the other hand, Text B positions Asperger's syndrome within a much broader, socio-medical context, emphasizing psychiatric comorbidities and the intersections with childhood maltreatment and trauma. The discussion includes a variety of psychiatric disorders and their co-occurrence with Asperger's, highlighting a more problematized and complex view of the condition, which is tied deeply with severe and negative life experiences like victimization and maltreatment. This reflects a shift towards understanding Asperger's syndrome not just as a standalone cognitive or neurological condition but also within the framework of broader psychiatric, social, and trauma-informed narratives.

Thus, the semantic drift from a primarily cognitive-focused description to one involving significant psychiatric and social dimensions suggests a broader, more integrated understanding of Asperger's syndrome in mental health contexts."
45,Asperger,"Autism is considered by many to be the most strongly genetically influenced multifactorial childhood psychiatric disorder. In the absence of any known gene or genes, the main support for this is derived from family and twin studies. Two recent studies (Greenberg et al. 2001; Betancur et al. 2002) suggested that the twinning process itself is an important risk factor in the development of autism. If true, this would have major consequences for the interpretation of twin studies. Both studies compared the number of affected twin pairs among affected sib pairs to expected values in two separate samples of multiplex families and reported a substantial and significant excess of twin pairs. Using data from our epidemiological study in Western Australia, we investigated the possibility of an increased rate of autism in twins. All children born between 1980 and 1995 with autism, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) were ascertained. Of the 465 children with a diagnosis, 14 were twin births (rate 30.0/1,000) compared to 9,640 children of multiple births out of a total of 386,637 births in Western Australia between 1980 and 1995 (twin rate weighted to number of children with autism or PDD per year 26.3/1,000). These data clearly do not support twinning as a substantial risk factor in the etiology of autism. We demonstrate that the high proportion of twins found in affected-sib-pair studies can be adequately explained by the high ratio of concordance rates in monozygotic (MZ) twins versus siblings and the distribution of family size in the population studied. Our results are in agreement with those of two similar studies by Croen et al. (2002) in California and Hultman et al. (2002) in Sweden.","The case of a 35-year-old biological woman with Asperger syndrome (AS) and gender identity disorder (GID) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria is reported.

Whilst we explain GID as a secondary feature of AS, we examine the assumption of the necessity of treating GID in AS as a primary GID in accordance with international standards. We consider the treatment of GID as compelling, particularly because curative therapy for AS is lacking and with GID treatment in this vein, the patient gains psychosocial improvement.","###Answer:

In comparison, Text B addresses Asperger syndrome with an emphasis on the psychological and social dimensions, specifically in relation to comorbid conditions like gender identity disorder. This shift from a purely clinical and genetic analysis to a more psychosocial and individual-based discussion across the texts suggests a notable semantic drift in how Asperger syndrome is approached and understood in different contexts."
46,Asperger,Autism spectrum conditions are diagnosed on the basis of impaired imagination. The present study used a totally free story-telling method to assess if narratives produced by children with autism or Asperger Syndrome (AS) contained fewer imaginative events.,A high prevalence of subjective insomnia in adults with Asperger syndrome has been reported. In the present study the sleep quality of these patients was studied using wrist actigraphy. Nineteen adults with Asperger syndrome and frequent feelings of insomnia were compared with 10 controls devoid of neuropsychiatric disorders and subjective sleep problems during six consecutive nights. The patients had similar actigraphic sleep profile to the controls. The subjective low sleep quality in patients was not reflected in actigraphic assessment of sleep. This finding suggests that pervasive anxiety inherent in persons with Asperger syndrome predisposes them to insomnia complaints.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger Syndrome, which is consistently understood as being part of the autism spectrum. In Text A, the focus is on a specific characteristic associated with Asperger Syndrome relating to impaired imagination in narrative skills. Text B discusses sleep issues in individuals with Asperger Syndrome, exploring another dimension of the condition. Despite discussing different aspects of Asperger Syndrome, both texts maintain a consistent usage relating to the condition itself, indicating that the semantic meaning of ""Asperger"" has not undergone significant change between the texts. Both texts portray Asperger Syndrome as a specific diagnostic category within the broader autism spectrum, maintaining its core semantic identity in different contexts of discussion."
47,Asperger,"DSM-IV specifies that Asperger's disorder is a type of pervasive developmental disorder without clinically significant cognitive or language delay. There are no data, however, on the outcome of children with Asperger's disorder or on whether their outcome differs from that of children with autism. The objectives of this study were to compare the outcome of groups of children with these disorders over a period of 2 years on variables independent of the defining criteria and to identify variables that might account for these differences.","The objective of this article is to decompose the level of functioning phenotype in autism to see if it can be conceptualized as two simpler, but still familial, dimensional phenotypes of language and non-verbal IQ. We assembled 80 sibpairs with either autism, Asperger syndrome or atypical autism. To see whether the familial correlation on language scores was accounted for by the familial correlation on non-verbal IQ, residual language scores were calculated for each member of the sibpair based on a multiple regression equation using their IQ score as an explanatory or independent variable and controlling for the age and gender of the affected individual. These residual scores were then used to calculate intraclass correlations between affected sibs. This process was repeated using IQ as the dependent variable and language as a covariate. Within affected individuals there was a strong relation between non-verbal IQ (as measured by the Leiter performance scale) and language (as measured by the Vineland Communication Scale). In addition, there was familial correlation between sibs on both measures. Evidence of familial aggregation on both non-verbal IQ and language remained even after partialling out the effect of the covariates by regression analysis and by generalized estimating equation. These findings suggest that non-verbal IQ and language in PDD may arise from independent genetic mechanisms. The implications of this finding for linkage analysis and for identifying genetically informative phenotypes are discussed.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" (referred to as Asperger's syndrome, Asperger syndrome, or Asperger's disorder) maintains a relatively consistent meaning, still oriented around its identification as a type of developmental disorder characterized by certain phenotypic behavioral aspects that distinguish it from broader categories such as autism. Text A focuses on outlining and comparing Asperger’s disorder alongside autism regarding developmental outcomes, emphasizing its recognition as a distinct condition without significant cognitive or language delays typically associated with other forms of autism. Text B, while dealing with genetic research and the linkage of cognitive traits such as non-verbal IQ and language in pervasive developmental disorders (including Asperger syndrome), still treats it as a distinct subtype of autism, effectively maintaining the semantic boundary established in Text A. Both texts consider it under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders but highlight its particular traits and differentiation, showing continuity in the term's specific clinical and genetic research contexts over time."
48,Asperger,"Recent neuropathological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated developmental disturbances of neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex of autistic subjects. We report neuroradiological findings in two patients with Asperger's syndrome, a less severe variant of autism. One patient had left frontal macrogyria; the other had bilateral opercular polymicrogyria. A computer tomography (CT) scan performed on one of the patients' first-degree relatives (who had a bipolar disease) also showed cortical migration anomalies.","Across the autism spectrum, level of intelligence is highly dependent on the psychometric instrument used for assessment, and there are conflicting views concerning which measures best estimate autistic cognitive abilities. Inspection time is a processing speed measure associated with general intelligence in typical individuals. We therefore investigated autism spectrum performance on inspection time in relation to two different general intelligence tests. Autism spectrum individuals were divided into autistic and Asperger subgroups according to speech development history. Compared to a typical control group, mean inspection time for the autistic subgroup but not the Asperger subgroup was significantly shorter (by 31%). However, the shorter mean autistic inspection time was evident only when groups were matched on Wechsler IQ and disappeared when they were matched using Raven's Progressive Matrices. When autism spectrum abilities are compared to typical abilities, results may be influenced by speech development history as well as by the instrument used for intelligence matching.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: 
In both Text A and Text B, the word `Asperger` is used in a context that refers to a specific subset or condition within the autism spectrum. Text A discusses Asperger's syndrome in terms of its neurobiological aspects (reporting specific neurological findings like macrogyria and polymicrogyria in patients diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome), which supports its classification as a variant of autism. Text B, although focusing more on cognitive and psychological aspects, still identifies ""Asperger subgroup"" within the broader category of autism spectrum disorders and examines cognitive differences related to intelligence and developmental history (e.g., speech development).

Both texts use the term `Asperger` in line with its standard definition as a less severe form of autism characterized by specific neurodevelopmental differences without a significant shift in the basic understanding or application of the term. By consistently referencing it as part of the autism spectrum and discussing aspects specific to this condition, both textual contexts imply a stable meaning of the term over the time periods considered."
49,Asperger,"College students, with or without disabilities, are faced with numerous stressful situations within the university environment. For an individual diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, success at this level requires non-traditional supports. With limited knowledge of this disorder, the university staff are faced with a distinct disadvantage in their efforts to outline an appropriate plan. While providing traditional academic assistance is now commonplace, federal laws mandate that universities widen the scope of support so as not to exclude any student from campus activities or programs. In an effort to provide a framework for support, this article interfaces diagnostic information with the realities of college life. Areas of focus include the transition process, social rules, engagement in academic activities, and mastering a new life of independence. It is hoped that the presented suggestions might prove helpful as universities begin to establish service support teams and outline plans of support.","The goal of this paper is to illustrate the application of the tools of genetic epidemiology, particularly the family study method, to inform the classification of psychiatric disorders in adults and children. The first section describes family studies of adults designed to investigate the causes of comorbidity of anxiety and depression. The analysis of familial traits provides stronger evidence for the validity of certain sub-types of anxiety and mood disorders that co-occur within the same individual and within families. The second section presents an example of the use of the family study method to examine the validity of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A review of these studies suggests that the most consistently familial traits in ASD are language and communication skills, insistence on sameness and non-verbal IQ. These are also the traits most commonly associated with the differentiation of autism from Asperger disorder and PDDNOS using both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. From these data, a new classification system of the ASDs is proposed based on these familial traits.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The term ""Asperger"" in both Text A and Text B refers to Asperger Syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum characterized by its impact on social interactions and cognitive behaviors. Text A focuses on the implications and requirements for supporting individuals with Asperger Syndrome in a college setting, detailing their unique needs in transition, social interactions, and academic engagement. Text B, while discussing broader psychiatric conditions and family studies related to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), specifically references Asperger disorder as a differentiated aspect of ASD based on certain traits.

In both contexts, the usage of the word ""Asperger"" directly relates to the clinical and social understanding of Asperger Syndrome as part of the broader autism spectrum. Although Text B addresses genetic and familial studies which might suggest a deeper scientific exploration, the core understanding and application of the term concerning individuals with these traits remain consistent. Thus, there has been no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of ""Asperger"" between the contexts provided in Text A and Text B."
50,Asperger,"""Theory of mind,"" the ability to make inferences about others"" mental states, seems to be a modular cognitive capacity that underlies humans"" ability to engage in complex social interaction. It develops in several distinct stages, which can be measured with social reasoning tests of increasing difficulty. Individuals with Asperger""s syndrome, a mild form of autism, perform well on simpler theory of mind tests but show deficits on more developmentally advanced theory of mind tests. We tested patients with bilateral damage to orbito-frontal cortex (n = 5) and unilateral damage in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 5) on a series of theory of mind tasks varying in difficulty. Bilateral orbito-frontal lesion patients performed similarly to individuals with Asperger""s syndrome, performing well on simpler tests and showing deficits on tasks requiring more subtle social reasoning, such as the ability to recognize a faux pas. In contrast, no specific theory of mind deficits were evident in the unilateral dorsolateral frontal lesion patients. The dorsolateral lesion patients had difficulty only on versions of the tasks that placed demands on working memory.","Thalamic abnormalities have been reported in people with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) including Asperger's Disorder (ASP). The aim of the present study was to compare the volume and volume fraction of the thalamus and the metabolite concentrations in children and adolescents with ASP using the magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, the relationships between thalamic abnormalities and clinical features were examined.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both text excerpts provided, the term ""Asperger"" — relating to Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism spectrum disorder — is used within the context of neurodevelopmental studies addressing its specific characteristics and manifestations in individuals.

- **Text A** discusses deficits and functioning in social cognition tasks in individuals with Asperger’s syndrome, indicating their capacity in simpler theory of mind tests while highlighting struggles with more complex social reasoning challenges. This text aligns with the clinical perception of Asperger's syndrome as involving peculiarities in social interactions and cognitive processing. The mention of Asperger's syndrome here situates it in a scientific study comparing different brain regions and their respective impacts on the disorder.

- **Text B**, on the other hand, focuses more on structural brain differences in individuals with Asperger's disorder through imaging and spectroscopy studies. This text similarly underscores the biological and neurological facets of Asperger’s disorder, indicating a continuation of the medical and clinical view of Asperger's as part of the broader category of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). 

In summary, between the two periods represented, the target word ""Asperger"" maintains its reference to a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by particular cognitive and social interaction patterns. Both texts discuss Asperger’s within a clinical and neurodevelopmental framework albeit using different scientific methods. Thus, there's no significant semantic drift in terms of the fundamental meaning or connotation of ""Asperger""."
51,Asperger,"Subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS) are impaired in social interaction and imitation, but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. Because the mirror-neuron system (MNS) that matches observed and executed actions has been suggested to play an important role in imitation and in reading of other people's intentions, we assessed MNS functions in 8 adult AS subjects and in 10 healthy control subjects during imitation of still pictures of lip forms. In the control subjects, cortical activation progressed in 30 to 80-millisecond steps from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal sulcus, to the inferior parietal lobe, and to the inferior frontal lobe, and finally, 75 to 90 milliseconds later, to the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres. Similar activation sites were found in AS subjects but with slightly larger scatter. Activation of the inferior frontal lobe was delayed by 45 to 60 milliseconds and activations in the inferior frontal lobe and in the primary motor cortex were weaker than in control subjects. The observed abnormal premotor and motor processing could account for a part of imitation and social impairments in subjects with AS.","This study evaluated Mind Reading, an interactive systematic guide to emotions, for its effectiveness in teaching adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) to recognize complex emotions in faces and voices. Experiment 1 tested a group of adults diagnosed with AS/HFA (n = 19) who used the software at home for 10-15 weeks. Participants were tested on recognition of faces and voices at three different levels of generalization. A matched control group of adults with AS/HFA (n = 22) were assessed without any intervention. In addition, a third group of general population controls (n = 24) was tested. Experiment 2 repeated the design of Experiment 1 with a group of adults with AS/HFA who used the software at home and met in a group with a tutor on a weekly basis. They were matched to a control group of adults with AS/HFA attending social skills training and to a general population control group (n = 13 for all three groups). In both experiments the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group on close, but not distant, generalization tasks. Verbal IQ had significant effects in Experiment 2. Using Mind Reading for a relatively short period of time allows users to learn to recognize a variety of complex emotions and mental states. However, additional methods are required to enhance generalization.","###Answer:
- Target word: Asperger
- Text A: This text discusses Asperger's syndrome (AS) primarily in terms of its neurological and cognitive impairments, focusing on challenges in imitation and social interaction that are framed within the context of specific brain mechanisms, notably the mirror-neuron system (MNS). The usage here presents AS as a condition associated with distinguishable neural differences impacting social and motor skills.
- Text B: Here, Asperger syndrome (AS) is approached in a more interventionist context, describing an experimental study involving a tool designed to help individuals with AS (and high-functioning autism, HFA) improve their emotional recognition skills. The text highlights actions undertaken to manage or mitigate the symptoms of AS, focusing on the potential for individuals to learn and adapt despite the condition.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: From both texts, the core concept of ""Asperger syndrome"" remains largely the same, relating to a specific set of cognitive and behavioral traits that differentiate it from other conditions, with emphasis on social interaction and cognitive processing challenges. While Text A centers on a more detailed neurological exploration and Text B looks at practical interventions for associated symptoms, neither deviates fundamentally from the portrayal of AS as a condition characterized by specific cognitive and social difficulties. The primary focus stays on managing or understanding these challenges rather than redefining what Asperger syndrome is fundamentally about."
52,Asperger,"This study examines the narrative abilities of 28 high-functioning children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome and 22 typically developing children across two different discourse contexts. As compared with the typically developing children, the high-functioning group performed relatively well in the storybook context but exhibited difficulty imbuing their narratives of personal experience with the more sophisticated characteristics typically employed by the comparison group. Furthermore, children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome demonstrated impairments inferring and building on the underlying causal relationships both within and across story episodes in both narrative contexts. Findings further revealed that the narrative abilities of children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome were associated with performance on measures of emotional understanding, but not theory of mind or verbal IQ. Findings are discussed in relation to the social and emotional underpinnings of narrative discourse.","The rise in Infantile Autism, learning problems, cognitive decline with age, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Diseases and the SIDS epidemic, has a common cause in the rising dietary deficit in Omega-3 brain-food. This paper suggests that aside from the wider concept of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), the rise in Infantile Autism (IA) in the last decade is the effect of deficient brain-food (Omega-3). The consequent delay of development prolongs the 2nd regressive event in infancy to pruning of the centre in the Medial Frontal Lobe System that connects Hippocampus and Cingulum. With a consequently defective Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), the Delayed Response Function is affected leading to persistent psychosis. Post-Pubertal Episodic Psychoses are associated with acute reduction of excitation, a risk of breakdown of circuitry, insufficient fill-in mechanisms, and silent spots. An acute psychosis occurs if the silent spots comprise of SMA. Only two brain areas have continuous neurogenesis, indicating their important functions: the Hippocampus and Olfactory Bulb that belongs to the Lateral Frontal Lobe System essential to survival. Concerned with necessity of action in response to the environment, it relies upon short-term memory and Acute Feedback Mechanisms influenced by emotion and motivation from the external world. In contrast, the Medial Frontal Lobe network is controlled by Feed-Forward Predictive Mechanisms related to storage of information. The Delayed Response Function is mastered at 7 months, when 2nd event occurs with pruning of axons and dendrites. An abolished or defective Delayed Response Function seriously incapacitates an individual: A defective ""Social Brain"" with an inability for conscious action and to communicate, predominates in IA. There is a near lack of speech, despite normal vision and hearing in the minority without marked adversity in pregnancy, at delivery or in infancy. I propose that the recent rise in IA despite no rise in adversity signifies a rising deficiency in brain-food. That this is so is suggested by a changing clinical picture: no Mental Retardation in an IA majority. Deficit in Olfaction is pathognomonic in schizophrenia since 30 yrs and distinguishes the Asperger Syndrome. If brain-food deficiency alone sufficiently prolongs pruning to cause absent activity in SMA in infancy, less mentally retarded IA from other causes might be observed. Deficit in brain-food was evident in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: birthweight averaged 200-300 g lower than sibs, Omega-3 levels in brainstem were lower than controls. Only 20 % SIDS died in first hypoxic episode, suggesting such episodes are more frequent than we imagined. Children with learning-behaviour problems have similarly depressed birthweight. A general deficiency in Omega-3 contributes to the lacking reduction in Schizophrenia, despite early puberty predominates. Olfactory Bulb is first affected in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Cognitive decline with age, Hippocampal dysfunctions rise markedly irrespective of disease, but the major mental illnesses and Infantile Autism in particular, benefit from ""brain-food"" that might also prevent a development of these disorders. To secure optimal brain function in the coming generations, there is a need to change the diet now from its emphasis on protein for body growth to food for the brain. This means there is a need to increase fish and sea food consumption.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""Asperger"" specifically identifies a condition within the autism spectrum, highlighting particular narrative and emotional understanding challenges in children diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. The focus is on the cognitive and social impairments related to this specific diagnosis. In Text B, however, the usage of ""Asperger"" is embedded in a broader discussion of various neurological conditions and developmental issues under the umbrella of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and also ties it with nutritional deficiencies affecting neurological development. The term seems less about the specific social and cognitive impairments and more about being a part of a wide range of disorders influenced by dietary factors. This expansion into a broader diagnostic context and emphasis on dietary causes represents a noticeable drift from the more focused clinical perspective seen in the earlier text."
53,Asperger,"Children with diagnoses of either autism or Asperger's syndrome were matched on measures of verbal mental age with nonautistic control children. They were tested on their abilities to process both facial and nonfacial stimuli. There were no significant differences between the low ability autistic and control groups, but the high ability autistic and Asperger's children performed significantly worse than controls across all tests. Group averages masked substantial individual variation. The results are seen as indicating a general perceptual deficit that is not specific to faces or emotions. This appears to be a common correlate of autism and Asperger's syndrome, rather than a core symptom.","Sleep patterns of 32 school-age children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) were compared to those of 32 typically developing age- and gender-matched children, using parent survey and one week of diary and actigraphic monitoring. Parents of children with AS/HFA more commonly reported that their children had difficulty falling asleep. One week of sleep recording with diary and actigraphy confirmed that children in the AS/HFA group spent a longer time awake in bed before falling asleep than children in the control group, possibly because the children in the AS/HFA group had earlier bedtimes. Other essential aspects of sleep patterns coincided between the groups. The sleep patterns of children with AS and HFA did not differ.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In the two texts provided, the term ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger's syndrome, which is consistently described as a condition or syndrome within the autism spectrum. Text A discusses the abilities of children diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome along with other forms of autism in processing various stimuli. Text B discusses the sleep patterns of children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA), again in a context that does not deviate from its recognized medical and behavioral implications associated with the autism spectrum. There is a strong implication in both texts that Asperger's is a subset of autism-related conditions, focusing on specific challenges or characteristics (perceptual deficits in Text A and sleep issues in Text B) without changing the underlying definition of Asperger's syndrome itself. Hence, there is no significant shift in meaning or connotation of the word ""Asperger"" between these texts."
54,Asperger,"A health questionnaire based on parental observations of clinical signs of fatty acid deficiency (FAD) showed that patients with autism and Asperger's syndrome (ASP) had significantly higher FAD scores (6.34+/-4.37 and 7.64+/-6.20, respectively) compared to controls (1.78+/-1.68). Patients with regressive autism had significantly higher percentages of 18:0,18:2n-6 and total saturates in their RBC membranes compared to controls, while 24:0, 22:5n-6, 24:1 and the 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 ratio were significantly higher in both regressive autism and ASP groups compared to controls. By comparison, the 18:1n-9 and 20:4n-6 values were significantly lower in patients with regressive autism compared to controls while 22:5n-3, total n-3 and total dimethyl acetals were significantly lower in both regressive autism and ASP groups compared to controls. Storage of RBC at -20 degrees C for 6 weeks resulted in significant reductions in highly unsaturated fatty acid levels in polar lipids of patients with regressive autism, compared to patients with classical autism or ASP, or controls. Patients diagnosed with both autism and ASP showed significantly increased levels of EPA ( approximately 200%) and DHA ( approximately 40%), and significantly reduced levels of ARA ( approximately 20%), 20:3n-6 and ARA/EPA ratio in their RBC polar lipids, when supplemented with EPA-rich fish oils, compared to controls and non-supplemented patients with autism. Patients with both regressive autism and classical autism/Asperger's syndrome had significantly higher concentrations of RBC type IV phospholipase A2 compared to controls. However, patients with autism/ASP, who had taken EPA supplements, had significantly reduced PLA2 concentrations compared to unsupplemented patients with classical autism or ASP.","This study was designed to identify items of the ADI-R that allow an early and sensitive identification of children with possible Asperger syndrome (AS). The aim was to obtain an economic short interview suitable for screening purposes. The study was based on data from a clinical sample of 5-18-year-old children and adolescents (mean age 10.9 years) with either Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; n = 43) or AS (n = 62). The introductory questions and 36 items, which contribute to the diagnostic algorithm of the ADI-R, were subjected to content analysis and stepwise discriminant function analysis. Eight meaningful items were found, which were shown to be good predictors of AS and to discriminate between the children with AS and those with ADHD. The short interview was especially useful for the assessment and screening of children up to 11 years in our sample, because in this subgroup, sensitivity was even higher (.92) and specificity was also excellent (.90). Eight items with high discriminatory power allowed sensitive and economic screening for young children with suspected AS.","###Answer:
- Target word: Asperger
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""Asperger"" (referring to Asperger syndrome or AS) is used to denote a specific condition within the autism spectrum. Text A discusses clinical observations and biochemical data associated with patients diagnosed with autism and Asperger's syndrome, focusing on fatty acid profiles and their implications. Text B focuses on diagnostic strategies for identifying children with Asperger syndrome using a specific diagnostic tool (ADI-R). Despite the different focuses—Text A on biochemical research and Text B on clinical diagnosis—the underlying usage of the term ""Asperger"" remains consistent, referring to the same diagnostic category within the broader spectrum of autism-related conditions. There is no significant change in the meaning or clinical understanding of Asperger syndrome between the two texts, suggesting that the target word has not undergone semantic drift within this context."
55,Asperger,"Three studies are reported that address the often described impoverished creativity in autism. Using the Torrance Creativity Tests, Experiment 1 found that children with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS) showed impairments. Experiment 2 tested two explanations of these results: the executive dysfunction and the imagination deficit hypotheses. Results supported both hypotheses. Children with autism and AS could generate possible novel changes to an object, though they generated fewer of these relative to controls. Furthermore, these were all reality-based, rather than imaginative. Experiment 3 extended this using a test of imaginative fluency. Children with autism and AS generated fewer suggestions involving attribution of animacy to foam shapes, compared to controls, instead generating reality-based suggestions of what the shapes could be. Although this is evidence of executive dysfunction, it does not directly account for why imaginative creativity is more difficult than reality-based creativity.","Individuals with Asperger's disorder and high functioning autism often don't have diagnosis during the childhood because of their high intelligence. It is not easy to diagnose adults as pervasive developmental disorder, because the information about their state and episodes in the childhood depends on the retrospective memories by caregivers and themselves. Although some researchers proposed that biological indicators might be useful for diagnosis, they have not found reliable indicators yet. Diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder based only on biological indicators has limitations, because pervasive developmental disorder is biologically heterogeneous, and the diagnosis criteria were made based on abnormal behaviors, but not on the biological characteristics. However it is expected that the biological indicators that are useful to diagnose will be found in the near future. The outlines of neuroimaging and eye tracking studies that are relatively simple and useful methods, including findings of our studies, are introduced in this review.","###Answer:

Despite exploring different contexts—Text A observing challenges related to creativity in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and Text B discussing diagnostic challenges and heterogeneity in adults—the essential use and reference of 'Asperger' in the context of autism spectrum remains clearly the same. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning or connotation of the word 'Asperger' between the two periods."
56,Asperger,The purpose of the study was to examine behavioral/cognitive and neuroradiological features of patients with concurrent Tourette's disorder (TD) and Asperger's syndrome (AS).,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impairments in social/communication abilities and restricted behaviors. The present study aims to examine color vision discrimination in ASD children and adolescents without intellectual disability. The participants were also subdivided in order to compare color vision thresholds of autistic participants and those who achieved diagnostic criteria for Asperger Syndrome (AS). Nine subjects with autism, 11 participants with AS and 36 typically developing children and adolescents participated in the study. Color vision was assessed by the Cambridge Color Test (CCT). The Trivector protocol was administered to determine color discrimination thresholds along the protan, deutan, and tritan color confusion lines. Data from ASD participants were compared to tolerance limits for 90% of the population with 90% probability obtained from controls thresholds. Of the 20 ASD individuals examined, 6 (30%) showed color vision losses. Elevated color discrimination thresholds were found in 3/9 participants with autism and in 3/11 AS participants. Diffuse and tritan deficits were found. Mechanisms for chromatic losses may be either at the retinal level and/or reflect reduced cortical integration.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both texts provided, the target word ""Asperger"" is consistently used to denote a specific form of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterized by higher-functioning individuals on the autism spectrum with specific behavioral and social interaction patterns. Text A focuses on examining behavioral and neuroimaging features of patients with Asperger's syndrome alongside Tourette's disorder, while Text B distinguishes Asperger Syndrome within the broader context of Autism Spectrum Disorders, specifically in relation to color vision discrimination capacities. 

There is no indication that the fundamental understanding or meaning of the term ""Asperger"" has shifted significantly between the contexts or time periods of the texts. Both instances maintain a clinical and diagnostic perspective, highlighting a specialized subcategory of autism with a focused set of symptoms and characteristics, regardless of the broader analysis encompassing various aspects of ASD in Text B. Thus, the semantic use of ""Asperger"" remains similar and stable, focused on denoting a specific autism profile."
57,Asperger,"The social impairments of autism, which are especially salient in autism of the Asperger type, have been attributed to a failure of affective processing, and more recently to a failure to develop a ""theory of mind"". Recent research evidence bearing on these theories is reviewed and a new hypothesis is put forward, based on research in progress, which posits a developmentally earlier abnormality of the ""social gaze response"": the inherent tendency of the normal infant to focus gaze and attention on social cues and, later, on objects in the environment as indicated by the gesture of gaze of others. Weakness or absence of the social gaze response is enough, it is argued, to account for many of the typical symptoms of autism, including the failure to acquire a theory of mind.","Including children with autism in regular classrooms has become prevalent; yet some evidence suggests such placements could increase the risk of isolation and rejection. In this study, we used social network methods to explore the involvement of children with autism in typical classrooms. Participants were 398 children (196 boys) in regular 2nd through 5th grade classes, including 17 children (14 boys) with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. Children reported on friendship qualities, peer acceptance, loneliness, and classroom social networks. Despite involvement in networks, children with autism experienced lower centrality, acceptance, companionship, and reciprocity; yet they did not report greater loneliness. Future research is needed to help children with autism move from the periphery to more effective engagement with peers.","###Answer:
- Target word: Asperger
- Label: Unchanged

####Reason:
Both Text A and Text B utilize the term ""Asperger"" within the context of autism spectrum disorders, emphasizing its association with social interaction impairments and cognitive aspects characteristic of this particular subtype of autism. 

In Text A, ""Asperger"" is described with a specific focus on social impairments and the theoretical perspectives of affective processing and development of a ""theory of mind."" It suggests that individuals with ""Asperger type"" autism exhibit distinct social and cognitive symptoms, focusing on the inability to develop typical social responses and cognitive understanding of others' mental states.

Text B, while discussing social integration within educational settings, continues to highlight similar attributes of Asperger's syndrome, albeit with a focus on how these individuals interact in typical social environments like classrooms. It mentions children with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome facing challenges in peer acceptance and involvement in social networks despite not feeling lonelier, thus reinforcing that the impairments primarily affect observable social interactions and acceptance, consistent with perspectives in Text A.

Both texts maintain a consistent understanding of Asperger's syndrome as a variant of autism characterized by significant social interaction difficulties, cognitive peculiarities, and challenges in navigating typical social environments. There is no significant semantic drift in terms of its fundamental descriptions or the attributes associated with it between the periods covered by Text A and Text B."
58,Asperger,"Two experiments are described in which the memory of adults with Asperger's syndrome is compared with that of verbal IQ controls. The results of the first experiment showed that the Asperger subjects resembled autistic adults and children in their failure to use category information to aid their free recall. In the second experiment, both groups of subjects showed similar priming effects in an implicit stem completion task and similar performance on an explicit cued recall task. Moreover, both groups also showed more priming for items that they had read at study and better recall for items that they had to generate at study, suggesting that the cued recall of the Asperger subjects did not result from contamination by automatic or involuntary processes.","To examine the implications for research of the use of three alternative definitions for Asperger syndrome (AS).

- Text A (Timeframe Unknown): The context presents Asperger's syndrome within the realm of developmental disorders characterized by specific difficulties in memory processes similar to those observed in other forms of autism. The study focuses on behavioral aspects and cognitive challenges faced by individuals with Asperger's syndrome, emphasizing a similarity in memory dysfunctions compared to autistic individuals.

- Text B (Timeframe Unknown): This text discusses Asperger syndrome with a focus on the diagnostic criteria and the implications of using different definitions across nosologic systems. It highlights an interest in understanding varying IQ profiles, comorbid symptoms, and the impact of familial aspects on social and other psychiatric symptoms among individuals diagnosed under different systems.

###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
While Text A explores cognitive and behavioral aspects of individuals with Asperger’s syndrome, primarily focusing on memory functionalities and comparison with autism, Text B concentrates more on the diagnostic differences and considerations in clinical research related to Asperger syndrome. Despite these differences in focus, the underlying concept of Asperger's as a developmental and psychological condition characterized by specific symptoms and cognitive profiles remains consistent between both texts. There is no evidence of a significant semantic shift in the meaning or the societal understanding of the term 'Asperger' between the two texts. Both texts use it to describe a neurodevelopmental condition, maintaining a stable semantic comprehension over time in medical and psychological contexts."
59,Asperger,"Sleep disturbances are common in patients with Asperger disorder. Although these sleep problems are often persistent and may significantly impair the child's daytime well-being, no treatment studies have been reported. In this open clinical trial, the effectiveness of melatonin was studied in a sample of 15 children with Asperger disorder (13 boys, 2 girls) aged 6-17 years using several questionnaires and actigraph measurements. They included assessments of sleep quality, tiredness, and behavior. Melatonin (3 mg/day) was used for 14 days. All the measurements were made three times: before the treatment period, during the treatment (days 12-14), and 3 weeks after the discontinuation of the treatment. The sleep patterns of all the children improved, and half of them displayed excellent responses to melatonin. In particular, actigraphically measured sleep latency decreased from 40.02 +/- 24.09 minutes to 21.82 +/- 9.64 minutes (p = 0.002), whereas sleep duration remained steady at 477.40 +/- 55.56 minutes and 480.48 +/- 50.71 minutes. Despite the short duration of the treatment, behavioral measures also displayed a significant improvement, and most of the effect disappeared after the discontinuation of the melatonin (p = 0.001). In conclusion, melatonin may provide an interesting new and well-tolerated treatment option for children with Asperger disorder suffering from chronic insomnia. However, these results must be confirmed in a controlled study.","Asperger's syndrome in adulthood is frequently associated with depression, but few studies have explored the lifetime experience of self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide plans or attempts in this clinical group. We aimed to assess this prevalence in a clinical cohort of patients in the UK.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger disorder"" in Text A refers to a specific form of autism spectrum disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. The text mainly discusses the treatment of sleep disturbances in children diagnosed with this disorder. In Text B, the term ""Asperger's syndrome"" similarly refers to a form of autism, emphasizing the psychological challenges like depression and suicidal ideation faced by adults diagnosed with this condition. Although the texts focus on different life stages and associated challenges (childhood sleep issues vs. adult depression and suicidal tendencies), the core meaning of the term relating to a specific form of autism remains consistent across both texts without significant semantic drift in the definition or understanding of Asperger disorder or Asperger's syndrome."
60,Asperger,"In a population study, 55 children aged 13 years and under were diagnosed as suffering from autistic disorder according to DSM-III-R criteria. Fifteen of these children (27%) were born to parents, at least one of whom had migrated to Sweden. These 15 cases were analysed in some detail with a view to finding possible background factors that could account for the relatively high prevalence of autism among some immigrant populations. In a few cases, autism or Asperger syndrome had been diagnosed in a native Swedish parent who went abroad in order to find a spouse. In several other cases, the child was the first child born in Sweden after the mother had moved there. The contribution of genetic and other prenatal factors to autism in immigrant populations is discussed.","Although Asperger syndrome is described by international classifications as a category of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), its validity as a specific entity distinct from autistic disorders remains controversial. The syndrome, first described by Hans Asperger, could not be distinguished from high functioning autism (onset, symptoms, outcome...). However, international classifications propose a distinction between the two syndromes based on a delayed onset, the absence of speech delay, the presence of motor disorders and a better outcome in Asperger syndrome. This categorical differentiation is not confirmed by current studies and in the absence of biological markers, no clinical, neuropsychological or epidemiological criteria makes it possible to distinguish high functioning autism from Asperger syndrome. From a clinical perspective, it is nevertheless of interest to isolate Asperger syndrome from other autistic disorders to propose specific assessment and therapy.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: The meaning and context of the term ""Asperger"" appear to have undergone a notable semantic drift between Text A and Text B. In Text A, ""Asperger"" is referred to in the context of clinical diagnoses alongside autism, particularly highlighting a family study involving genetic and prenatal factors. Asperger syndrome is not distinguished sharply from other forms of autism, and it seems somewhat interchangeable or closely aligned with broader autism diagnoses. By contrast, Text B delves into detailed comparative discussions distinguishing Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism based on criteria such as onset, absence of speech delay, presence of motor disorders, and overall outcomes. It also underscores the controversial and uncertain nature of categorizing Asperger syndrome distinctly from autism, highlighting the ongoing debates and lack of clear biological markers or other distinguishing criteria. Thus, the conceptual treatment of ""Asperger"" appears to shift from a clinical diagnosis closely related to autism without significant differentiation, to a disorder whose specific classification is being actively debated and scrutinized, pointing to a semantic shift in how the term is understood and used in professional discourse."

It has been suggested that the sex difference in 2D:4D arises early in development and that finger ratio is a correlate of prenatal testosterone and oestrogen. In children, 2D:4D has been reported to be associated with measures of fetal growth, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, developmental psychopathology, autism and Asperger's syndrome. However, little is known of the patterns of sex and ethnic differences in the 2D:4D ratio of children.","Asperger's disorder (ASP), like other autism spectrum disorders, is associated with altered responsiveness to social stimuli. This study investigated learning and responsiveness to nonsocial, but motivational, stimuli in ASP. We examined choice behavior and galvanic skin conductance responses (SCRs) during the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara et al., 1994) in 15 adolescents and young adults with ASP and 14 comparison subjects. We examined aspects of learning, attention to wins and losses, and response style with a formal cognitive model, the Expectancy-Valence Learning model (Busemeyer & Stout, 2002). The ASP group did not differ from the comparison group in proportions of selections from advantageous decks. However, ASP participants showed a distinct pattern of selection characterized by frequent shifts between the four IGT decks, whereas comparison participants developed clear deck preferences. SCR results showed some evidence of reduced responsiveness in the ASP group during the IGT. Results from the cognitive model indicated that, in contrast to the comparison group, the ASP group's selections were less consistent with the motivational significance they assigned to decks. Findings are discussed in the context of the neurobiological substrates associated with IGT performance.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, ""Asperger's syndrome"" is discussed in the context of developmental and biological correlations such as prenatal hormone influences and its association with autism. Here, Asperger's is primarily placed within a biological framework in relation to physical and developmental features. On the other hand, Text B uses ""Asperger's disorder"" and focuses more directly on the psychological and behavioral aspects, investigating cognitive and emotional responsiveness in social and motivational contexts. The terminology change from ""Asperger's syndrome"" to ""Asperger's disorder"" also reflects a shift in how the condition is perceived and classified; emphasizing a broader, more integrated understanding of Asperger's as part of the autism spectrum disorders that include cognitive and emotional aspects, along with a neurobiological basis. This points to an enriched understanding in the study and discourse around Asperger's, taking into account behavioral science and neurobiology more evidently over time."
62,Asperger,"Pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation is a new clinical category including high-functioning autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder non otherwise specified. Its recognition is recent and still problematic in many regards. This article reviews the historical, theoretical and clinical relations between pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation and bordering disorders. The consequences of an inadequate diagnosis on measures of assistance for these patients is also investigated. The authors conclude on the necessity in considering, independently of the diagnosis, the description of symptoms, the intellectual level and the adaptative level in order to take the most appropriate educational and psychosocial decisions regarding pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation.","Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction, alongside unusually repetitive behaviours and narrow interests. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differs from classic autism in that in AS there is no language or general cognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are implicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity and neurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility to ASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) gene encodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes, neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia. A mutation in this gene has been identified in individuals with ASC and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been nominally associated with AS and autistic traits in previous studies.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger Syndrome, which is consistently described as a form of higher functioning within the autism spectrum without cognitive or significant language delays. Text A discusses this in the context of pervasive developmental disorders, emphasizing diagnostic boundaries and educational needs, while Text B elaborates on its genetic factors and distinct characteristics under the broader category of Autism Spectrum Conditions. Both texts, albeit highlighting different aspects, maintain the core definition and understanding of Asperger Syndrome as part of the autism spectrum focusing on social and communication difficulties without general developmental delays, indicating that the term has not undergone significant semantic drift."
63,Asperger,"Forty-seven individuals (28 male and 19 female) referred for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in childhood were followed-up 15 years later (range 6-22 years) in respect of psychiatric and personality disorders. In early adulthood, the patients could be sub-divided into 4 groups of about equal size. One group had no later OCD, another had OCD on a sub-clinical level, a third group had an episodic course of OCD, and a final group had a chronic and often very disabling OCD. Outcome was similar in males and females, except that more girls had an episodic course. Eating disorder was diagnosed in 4 (21%) of the females, and Asperger syndrome in 2 (7%) of the males, at follow-up.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), comprising classic autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified, represent complex neurodevelopmental conditions characterised by impaired social interactions, difficulties with communication and repetitive, stereotyped behaviours. It is estimated that up to 1% of the general population may be affected by an ASD. Whether due to improved diagnostic techniques or a true rise in incidence, the prevalence of patients with ASD is rising, and these individuals are increasingly encountered in a variety of healthcare settings. Care givers of patients with an ASD report frequently that lack of awareness of the complications of these disorders and the method of appropriately assessing these individuals impair the effective delivery of healthcare to this patient population. It is now clear that patients with an ASD, in addition to the defining characteristics of these disorders, can present to the outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings with a variety of psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, nutritional/metabolic, dental, ophthalmological, cardiovascular, gynaecological, traumatic and musculoskeletal conditions that can require acute intervention. In addition, the common treatments given to patients with an ASD may result in side effects and complications that may require acute intervention. For physicians who encounter patients with an ASD, the combination of impaired social interactions, difficulties with communication and stereotyped behaviours creates an additional barrier to diagnosis and treatment of these individuals. Careful preparation of the examination environment, direct engagement of care givers and the patient and the use of communication techniques and pharmacological adjuncts can aid physicians in treating the patient with an ASD in the outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings.","###Answer:
- **Target word**: Asperger
- **Label**: Changed
- **Reason**: In **Text A**, the word ""Asperger"" is specifically linked to a discussion of individual cases where Asperger syndrome was diagnosed among a group of patients primarily referred for OCD. It treats Asperger syndrome as a distinct clinical entity within a narrow context. In **Text B**, the concept of ""Asperger syndrome"" is included under the broader umbrella of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), which suggests a more integrated perspective on neurodevelopmental disorders. The text emphasizes a complex, multi-faceted view of ASDs, of which Asperger is just one part, indicating a shift towards viewing these conditions as part of a spectrum with shared characteristics rather than strictly isolated diagnoses. This change reflects a broader, more nuanced understanding of Asperger syndrome in relation to other autism spectrum disorders, aligned with contemporary shifts in diagnostic criteria and frameworks, particularly after the changes reflected in the DSM-5 published in 2013."
64,Asperger,To discuss special behavioural problems shown by a patient with Asperger's disorder from adolescence onward.,"Angela is an 18-year-old college freshman who made an appointment with her pediatrician because of academic and social difficulties at college. She was diagnosed with Asperger disorder at age 6 based on difficulties relating to adults and peers, perseverative patterns of interest, and normal language development.She received special education services in middle school to help follow directions and complete assignments. She reports feeling very isolated during this time. In freshman year of high school, she insisted on discontinuing special education and managed with weekly private individual psychotherapy.In sophomore year, Angela learned strategies to get additional help from her teachers about assignments, and her grades improved. Socially, she formed a close friendship with a classmate who was also on the autistic spectrum, and she found a group of friends through this individual. As a senior with an upward grade trajectory and good SAT scores, she was admitted to a competitive 4-year college. In a precollege consult 6 months ago, she was anxious about fitting in.Angela began college classes without accommodations, but she now describes a challenging semester. She has not made many friends. She finds her courses difficult and does not fully understand assignments. She believes her peers dislike her. She thinks she would benefit from receiving note-taking and other services and asks you to document her disability for the college so that she might obtain accommodations.You point out that the DSM-5 eliminates the Asperger category. Angela is concerned. She does not believe that her profile is consistent with autism spectrum disorder, and she fears that being labeled as autistic will be prejudicial at school. Yet she is worried about retaining eligibility for services on the basis of a disability. How do you counsel her?","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the use of the term ""Asperger's disorder"" is presented as a diagnostic label concerned specifically regarding behavioral problems from adolescence onward, indicating emphasis on certain developmental aspects unique to Asperger’s. However, in Text B, the term ""Asperger disorder"" relates to a broader context including educational and social difficulties and integrates personal choices and social implications surrounding the diagnostic label. Moreover, Text B transitions to discuss the changes made in the DSM-5, revealing an evolution in the understanding and classification of Asperger's disorder under the broader ""autism spectrum disorder"" category. This shift reflects a significant change in the medical and societal perception of Asperger’s disorder, from a distinct diagnosis to an integrated part of the autism spectrum, which impacts how individuals like Angela receive and perceive their diagnosis and available support, signifying semantic drift in medical and societal contexts."
65,Asperger,"The author presents the data of 4- to 25-year-long observation of a group of boys distinguished since the early age by a pronounced disproportionaity of the psychic development: an accelerated development of abstract-logical thinking with gross defects of sensuous perception, emotions, psychomotor functions, and adaptive behaviour as a whole. Despite the evolutional course of the state most of the patients appeared to be unable to independent social adaptation. The degree and structure of this disharmonic underdevelopment allow one to regard this pathology as a variant of nervous system dysontogenesis differing from, but bordering on such forms as Kanner's autism, Asperger's psychopathy, or mental retardation with partial giftedness.","Although people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often have severe problems with pragmatic aspects of language, little is known about their pragmatic reasoning. We carried out a behavioral study on high-functioning adults with autistic disorder (n = 11) and Asperger syndrome (n = 17) and matched controls (n = 28) to investigate whether they are capable of deriving scalar implicatures, which are generally considered to be pragmatic inferences. Participants were presented with underinformative sentences like ""Some sparrows are birds"". This sentence is logically true, but pragmatically inappropriate if the scalar implicature ""Not all sparrows are birds"" is derived. The present findings indicate that the combined ASD group was just as likely as controls to derive scalar implicatures, yet there was a difference between participants with autistic disorder and Asperger syndrome, suggesting a potential differentiation between these disorders in pragmatic reasoning. Moreover, our results suggest that verbal intelligence is a constraint for task performance in autistic disorder but not in Asperger syndrome.","###Label: Changed

###Reason:
In Text A, ""Asperger"" is discussed within the context of a specific type of psychopathy or psychological disorder, identified distinctly and separate from other forms of autism or mental conditions. The text outlines a specific developmental pattern and social adaptation challenges unique to what they refer to as ""Asperger's psychopathy,"" suggesting a clear, isolated diagnosis.

Text B, however, refers to ""Asperger syndrome"" more in the broader spectrum of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), highlighting differences but ultimately categorizing it under the larger umbrella term of ASD. The focus is on the comparison of pragmatic language capabilities between Asperger syndrome and other forms of autism, inferring that while differences exist, they are all part of a continuum of disorders.

The semantic drift observed here indicates a shift from viewing Asperger as a distinct, separate psychopathy (or condition) in earlier understandings (as seen in Text A) to a more integrated view where Asperger syndrome is understood as a variation within the broader spectrum of autism disorders (as seen in Text B). This demonstrates a significant change in the conceptualization and diagnostic framework surrounding the term ""Asperger."""
66,Asperger,"Asperger syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder widely regarded as a mild variant of autism.

Males with AS showed a trend toward lower Apgar scores at one minute (chi-square = 4; df = 1; P = 0.04) and were more likely to have been born to mothers outside the optimal age group of 20-30 years (chi-square = 5; df = 1; P = 0.02). They were also less likely to have been irritable and floppy as infants (chi-square = 3.8; df = 1; P = 0.05).

Alex has long-standing history of social difficulties, impulsivity, lying, controlling, manipulative behaviors, violent outbursts at home with subsequent lack of remorse, and excessive chatter. You referred Alex to an interdisciplinary child development clinic 2 years ago, where he was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He was noted to have normal cognitive and language skills. Attachment therapy, stimulant therapy, and school accommodations for ADHD were recommended.Alex received some individual counseling with the school psychologist for a year after the first evaluation, with little improvement in core behaviors. The following year, Alex established care with a psychiatrist and a private counselor. The psychiatrist prescribed a succession of stimulants, each of which worked for only a short time and then had waning effect. The counselor worked with Alex and his parents on managing Alex's behavior, which the family reports has been somewhat helpful.Alex's parents express great frustration and sadness that parenting Alex has been such an ongoing struggle since he was adopted. They note that Alex is superficially friendly, chatty, and charming, with everyone he encounters, including strangers, but he never progresses past such superficial interaction, even with his adoptive parents. The parents express that they are deeply wounded that Alex is not more loving and is not more appreciative of the fact that they rescued him from the orphanage.His parents asked his pediatric clinician about Autism as they observe Alex's lack of real affection and social connection with parents or peers. They also note that Alex has difficulty verbalizing his feelings and that he lies frequently, chatters tangentially, and he can watch the Discovery channel for hours.

### Reason:
In Text A (date unspecified, but appears to reference older clinical perspectives), Asperger syndrome (AS) is described in a clinical context as a mild variant of autism with specific comparisons to high-functioning autism concerning developmental history and obstetric factors. The focus is predominantly on the neurological and developmental aspects, viewing it through a clinical and somewhat narrow lens focused on symptoms and comparisons to conventional autism.

In Text B (also date unspecified, reflecting more recent perspectives likely post-2013 when the DSM-5 merged Asperger's into the autism spectrum disorder category), Asperger's syndrome characterization shifts to a more comprehensive, behavioral, and social context. It's depicted through a narrative involving a child with complex social and emotional difficulties and treatments encompassing different therapeutic approaches and educational accommodations. The usage of Asperger's here is holistic, emphasizing the social interaction difficulties in real-world settings rather than just a clinical diagnosis based on developmental checks.

The semantic drift is significant between the two texts. Text A uses Asperger primarily in a clinical-diagnostic context as a variant of autism with neurological differences, while Text B frames it within a broader narrative that includes social, emotional, and behavioral dimensions, recognizing it as part of a broader spectrum requiring multi-disciplinary interventions. The term's use has evolved from a strictly clinical designation to a more nuanced recognition of the varied manifestations and the need for integrated therapeutic strategies. This reflects the broader shift in understanding and addressing neurodevelopmental disorders within society."
67,Asperger,"The author describes some aspects of a once-weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy of a 12-year-old boy diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The patient's emotional and cognitive development had been impaired since early life, possibly due to an internal deficit and to the likelihood of inadequate environmental holding. He was unaware of having difficulties but was underachieving academically, was socially isolated and often visibly unhappy in his life. The patient's denial, splitting, and projection of emotion and insight presented the therapist with the difficult task of how to reach him. In order to communicate with him emotionally, the therapist created a modified technique which reflected the patient's development from part-object to whole-object relationships. This development became apparent in the sessions and was interpreted in the transference relationship. An account of the patient's early years was pieced together from a detailed commentary of what was being observed and intuited by the therapist during the sessions, as well as by an understanding of the countertransference. By the end of two years' treatment, the patient's sensitivity and creativity, which had been buried beneath a self-sufficient, autistic-like encapsulation, finally began to emerge in his communications with his therapist.","A 6-year-old boy had progressive muscle weakness since age 4 and emotional problems diagnosed as Asperger syndrome.

Respiratory chain activities were reduced for all enzymes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits, especially COX. Sequence analysis of the 22 tRNA genes revealed a novel G10406A base substitution, which was heteroplasmic in multiple tissues of the patient by RFLP analysis (muscle, 96%; urinary sediment, 94%; cheek mucosa, 36%; blood, 29%). The mutation was not detected in any accessible tissues from his mother or siblings. It appears that this mutation arose de novo in the proband, probably early in embryogenesis.","### Answer:

- Text A: Discusses the psychological and developmental aspects of Asperger's syndrome. The focus is on psychotherapeutic interventions tailored for a child diagnosed with Asperger's, highlighting the emotional, social, and academic challenges faced due to the disorder. The text describes in detail the therapy approaches and the psychological constructs (like part-object to whole-object relationships) utilized in treating the syndrome.
- Text B: Addresses a medical and genetic investigation into a boy with muscle weakness and emotional issues initially diagnosed as Asperger syndrome. The text focuses on a biological and genetic study, identifying a novel mutation affecting mitochondrial function, not directly related to Asperger's but possibly influencing the child's condition. The mention of Asperger's appears more as a part of the patient's broader clinical profile rather than the central topic of investigation.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""Asperger"" is used to describe and focus on the psychological and social aspects of Asperger's syndrome within the realm of psychotherapy. In Text B, while Asperger syndrome is mentioned, the focus is predominantly on genetic and mitochondrial abnormalities, suggesting that the syndrome's diagnosis might be incidental or secondary to the primary medical condition being investigated. The shift from a primarily psychological perspective around interpersonal and emotional development to a genetic and medical context suggests a significant semantic drift in the application and context of the term ""Asperger"" over time."
68,Asperger,"Asperger syndrome is an autistic disorder which was first described in 1944 without further acceptance in the literature over almost four decades. Following several publications in the ""80's, the disorder became more widely known. Asperger syndrome was introduced into ICD-10 and DSM-IV as a new diagnosis in 1988 and 1994, respectively. Several authors developed own criteria. Until now, some of the diagnostic criteria of Asperger syndrome remain controversial. We present a survey and a comparison of the criteria in the classification of DSM-IV, ICD-10 and of other authors.

Text A discusses the historical development and diagnostic criteria of Asperger syndrome as classified under various medical standards. Text B, though more focused on the broader social implications, specifically disability discrimination related to individuals with conditions such as Asperger syndrome, still refers to it as an aspect of the autism spectrum. Neither text deviates from identifying Asperger syndrome as a form related to autism, indicating that there has not been a significant semantic shift or drift in the usage of the term between the two texts from a medical classification perspective and its societal implications regarding discrimination."
69,Asperger,"Episodic memory is identified with autonoetic consciousness, which gives rise to remembering in the sense of self-recollection in the mental re-enactment of previous events at which one was present. Autonoetic consciousness is distinguished from noetic consciousness, which gives rise to awareness of the past that is limited to feelings of familiarity or knowing. Noetic consciousness is identified not with episodic but with semantic memory, which involves general knowledge. A recently developed approach to episodic memory makes use of 'first-person' reports of remembering and knowing. Studies using this approach have revealed many independent variables that selectively affect remembering and others that selectively affect knowing. These studies can also be interpreted in terms of distinctiveness and fluency of processing. Remembering and knowing do not correspond with degrees of confidence in memory. Nor does remembering always control the memory response. There is evidence that remembering is selectively impaired in various populations, including not only amnesic patients and older adults but also adults with Asperger's syndrome. This first-person approach to episodic memory represents one way in which that most elusive aspect of consciousness, its subjectivity, can be investigated scientifically. The two kinds of conscious experiences can be manipulated experimentally in ways that are systematic, replicable and intelligible theoretically.","The present population-based, case-control study examines associations between specific parental psychiatric disorders and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including childhood autism, Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD-NOS). The cohort includes 4713 children born between 1987 and 2005 with diagnoses of childhood autism, Asperger's syndrome or PDD-NOS. Cases were ascertained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register, and each was matched to four controls by gender, date of birth, place of birth, and residence in Finland. Controls were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Parents were identified through the Finnish Medical Birth Register and Finnish Central Population Register. Parental psychiatric diagnoses from inpatient care were collected from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess whether parents' psychiatric disorders predicted ASD after controlling for parents' age, smoking during pregnancy and weight for gestational age. In summary, parental schizophrenia spectrum disorders and affective disorders were associated with the risk of ASD regardless of the subgroup. PDD-NOS was associated with all parental psychiatric disorders investigated. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings. These results may facilitate the investigation of shared genetic and familial factors between ASD and other psychiatric disorders.","### Answer:

The usage of Asperger’s syndrome here is within the scope of autism spectrum disorders and explores the potential genetic and familial links within these conditions.

#### Label: Unchanged
#### Reason:
Both Text A and Text B describe Asperger as part of a functional or situational context conforming to a type of autism spectrum disorder, focusing on its effects on cognitive or developmental aspects, thus the core significance of the term ""Asperger"" as it relates to a variant of autism remains constant despite evolving discussions around its implications and genetic associations. The basic understanding of Asperger as a form of autism hasn't significantly shifted between the contexts provided by these texts."
70,Asperger,"Since the introduction of a separate diagnosis for Asperger's syndrome in the ICD-10 and DSM-IV classification systems, a controversial debate has continued on whether Asperger's syndrome is a specific, clearly distinguishable disorder within the autistic spectrum or whether it represents a milder phenotypical variation of autism. The effect on the amount of autistic symptoms of the variables language delay and level of intelligence was analyzed within a sample of individuals exhibiting autism diagnosed by standardized methods. Both variables showed a significant effect on the degree of autistic symptoms in that impairments in social interaction were less noticeable. In addition, a subsample of individuals exhibited symptoms assumed to be characteristic for Asperger's syndrome. The findings support the assumption that autism and Asperger's syndrome represent ""extreme points"" on a scale of severity, which leads to the suggestion that the classification of different subtypes of autism could be abandoned in favor of a dimensional (multiaxial) approach.","Here we present the case of a 17-year-old male patient, affected by Asperger syndrome, who reached the emergency division of our hospital after anal insertion of some stylus batteries.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the word ""Asperger"" (referring to Asperger's syndrome) is used to describe a form of autism spectrum disorder characterized by symptoms and behaviors indicative of the condition. Text A focuses on the clinical and diagnostic aspects, discussing whether Asperger's syndrome should be seen as a distinct disorder or simply a milder form of autism. Text B describes a clinical situation involving a patient with Asperger's syndrome, emphasizing the behavioral manifestations of the syndrome. While the contexts in which the word is used are different, the fundamental meaning of ""Asperger"" as a specific autism spectrum disorder remains consistent and unaltered between the two texts."
71,Asperger,"With publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV), standardized criteria for Asperger Disorder, a putative subtype of Pervasive Developmental Disorder, are now available. This paper examines the four cases Asperger originally presented in his seminal paper (1991/1994), using DSM-IV criteria to determine whether a diagnosis of Autistic or Asperger Disorder is most appropriate. We found that all four cases met DSM-IV criteria for Autistic Disorder, rather than Asperger Disorder. This suggests that the syndrome Asperger originally described may not be captured by present diagnostic criteria. Implications for future research are discussed.","It is unclear whether the increase in autism over the past two decades is a real increase or due to changes in diagnosis and ascertainment of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which include autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers to a subtype or category within the broader spectrum of autism-related disorders, specifically related to distinct diagnostic criteria and clinical characteristics. Text A addresses how cases previously analyzed by Hans Asperger would fit into the then-modern DSM-IV criteria, potentially aligning more closely with Autistic Disorder rather than Asperger Disorder despite its original classification. Text B also addresses the diagnostic aspect by considering Asperger syndrome within the spectrum of autism diagnoses, mentioning how its diagnosis might be influenced by changes in diagnostic criteria. Thus, although there is an ongoing discussion and potential reevaluation of where Asperger's fits within the autism spectrum, the fundamental concept related to its classification, diagnosis, and differentiation remains consistent between the two texts."
72,Asperger,"Cytoarchitectonic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, mammillary bodies, and septum were reported in a postmortem study of autism. Previously, the authors found smaller cingulate volume and decreased metabolism of the cingulate in seven autistic patients. In this study, they measured the volume and glucose metabolism of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus in an expanded group of 17 patients with autism spectrum disorders (autism [N=10] or Asperger's disorder [N=7]) and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.","Deficits in social functioning are a core feature of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), being linked to various cognitive and developmental factors, but there has been little attempt to draw on normative models of social cognition to understand social behaviour in ASD. The current study explored the utility of Crick and Dodge's (1994) information processing model to studying social cognition in ASD, and examined associations between social information processing patterns, theory of mind skills and social functioning. A matched-group design compared young people with Asperger syndrome with typically developing peers, using a social information processing interview previously designed for this purpose. The Asperger syndrome group showed significantly different patterns of information processing at the intent attribution, response generation and response evaluation stages of the information processing model. Theory of mind skills were found to be significantly associated with parental ratings of peer problems in the Asperger syndrome group but not with parental ratings of pro-social behaviour, with only limited evidence of an association between social information processing and measures of theory of mind and social functioning. Overall, the study supports the use of normative social information processing approaches to understanding social functioning in ASD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" refers to a specific form of Autism Spectrum Disorder characterized by particular patterns of behavior and cognitive functions, especially affecting social interaction and processing, without a general delay in language or cognitive development. Text A uses ""Asperger's disorder"" within a clinical study context to designate a subgroup of autism spectrum disorders, evaluating anatomical and metabolic features in comparison with other autistic disorders and controls. Text B discusses ""Asperger syndrome"" in the scope of a social and cognitive processing model, examining how individuals with this syndrome interpret and respond to social situations differently compared to typically developing peers. Both texts treat ""Asperger"" as a distinct category within the broader autism spectrum focusing on its unique impact on social cognition, and there's no significant semantic shift in the term's usage over time despite the different focuses in research context."
73,Asperger,"An 8 year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome had difficulties in communicating with his teachers and classmates. He occasionally stole out of the classroom. He could not sleep at night recalling his awful experience and kept crying every night and refused to go to school. The treatment with fluvoxamine was started at the dose of 25 mg daily. Four weeks after the treatment, his repetitive behavior and hyperactivity decreased and night crying diminished. Although he still has difficulties in communicating with others, he is now able to attend extra-curricular classes in a private school.

- Reason: The use of the term ""Asperger"" has undergone semantic drift from Text A to Text B in terms of medical categorization and perceptual understanding. In Text A, ""Asperger's syndrome"" is referred to as a specific disorder with characteristic symptoms and management using fluvoxamine, emphasizing its distinct nature. The description focuses on individual symptoms and an individualized treatment plan. In contrast, Text B reflects the modern classification where ""Asperger's syndrome"" is encapsulated under the broader category ""Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)"" alongside other related disorders. This shift represents a move towards a more integrated and spectrum-based view of what was previously considered a standalone disorder. This evolution in its categorization implies a broader, more inclusive understanding of Asperger's syndrome within the context of autism spectrum disorders, affirming a notable change in the perception and clinical approach to Asperger's syndrome over time."

Three also developed Tourette syndrome: the co-occurrence of the two disorders, and methods of intervention, are discussed.","We combined eye-tracking technology with a test of facial affect recognition and a measure of self-reported social anxiety in order to explore the aetiology of social-perceptual deficits in Asperger's syndrome (AS). Compared to controls matched for age, IQ and visual-perceptual ability, we found a group of AS adults was impaired in their recognition of fearful and sad expressions and spent significantly less time fixating the eye region of all faces. For AS subjects, but not controls, the extent of the failure to fixate the eyes predicted the degree of impairment at recognising fearful expressions. In addition, poor fear recognition and reduced fixation of the eyes were independently associated with greater levels of social anxiety in AS individuals. These findings support the hypothesis that avoidance of emotionally arousing stimuli, such as eyes, contributes to social-perceptual impairment in AS. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with theories implicating amygdala-mediated over-arousal and anxiety in the development of these social-perceptual deficits.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The meaning of the target word ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger's syndrome"" (AS) retains a consistent definition and context between the two texts. 

In Text A, Asperger's syndrome is discussed with a focus on its diagnostic criteria, differentiating it from similar disorders like infantile autism. The primary emphasis is on providing a clinical, traditional perspective on understanding and recognizing the disorder through cases and psychological criteria.

Text B, while more centered on specific research employing eye-tracking technology and social-perceptual experiments, still maintains Asperger's syndrome within the framework of a developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication. Although the techniques and focus areas (like the eye-tracking study and exploration of social anxiety) are modernized, the core concept of Asperger's syndrome as a developmental disorder with specific impairments remains consistent.

Both texts view Asperger's syndrome through a clinical and psychological lens, focusing on identifying, analyzing, and understanding the behavioral and neurodevelopmental characteristics of the disorder. There is no evidence of a semantic shift in the term ""Asperger's syndrome"" between the two texts. The exploration depth, methodologies, and aspects of the disorder might vary, but the underlying identification and conceptualization of Asperger's syndrome remain unchanged."
75,Asperger,"Satisfaction with disclosure of the diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder was investigated using a self-report questionnaire completed by 126 parents. On a rating of satisfaction, 55 percent indicated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the disclosure. Parents were more likely to be satisfied if they gave positive ratings to the manner of the professional and the quality of the information provided; if they had been given written information and the opportunity to ask questions; and if their early suspicions had been accepted by professionals. These factors were combined into a global index of satisfaction; those gaining higher scores were more likely to have been given the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (as opposed to autism), to have had a definite diagnosis, and to have children who were not currently in an educational placement. These results underline the importance of the interaction between parent and professional during the disclosure interview.","Can adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) infer what happened to someone from their emotional response? Millikan has argued that in everyday life, others' emotions are most commonly used to work out the antecedents of behavior, an ability termed retrodictive mindreading. As those with ASD show difficulties interpreting others' emotions, we predicted that these individuals would have difficulty with retrodictive mindreading. Sixteen adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome and 19 typically developing adults viewed 21 video clips of people reacting to one of three gifts (chocolate, monopoly money, or a homemade novelty) and then inferred what gift the recipient received and the emotion expressed by that person. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they viewed the videos. Results showed that participants with ASD were only less accurate when inferring who received a chocolate or homemade gift. This difficulty was not due to lack of understanding what emotions were appropriate in response to each gift, as both groups gave consistent gift and emotion inferences significantly above chance (genuine positive for chocolate and feigned positive for homemade). Those with ASD did not look significantly less to the eyes of faces in the videos, and looking to the eyes did not correlate with accuracy on the task. These results suggest that those with ASD are less accurate when retrodicting events involving recognition of genuine and feigned positive emotions, and challenge claims that lack of attention to the eyes causes emotion recognition difficulties in ASD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" (or ""Asperger's syndrome"") refers distinctly to a category within the broader classification of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Text A discusses satisfaction related to the disclosure of diagnoses within the autism spectrum, explicitly mentioning Asperger syndrome as a specific diagnosis as opposed to general autism. Text B explores the ability of individuals with Asperger's syndrome, referred to within the context of high-functioning autism, to infer emotions and reactions in social contexts. Despite the evolving understanding and terminologies in the domain of ASD, the specific reference to Asperger's syndrome in both texts concerns the characterization of a particular set of behavioral and cognitive features that distinguish it from other forms on the autism spectrum. The usage points to a consistent application of the term with regard to its distinction within the broader autism category, without significant drift in meaning or application between the texts from different periods."
76,Asperger,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysfunction in three core behavioral domains: repetitive behaviors, social deficits, and language abnormalities. There is evidence that abnormalities exist in peptide systems, particularly the oxytocin system, in autism spectrum patients. Furthermore, oxytocin and the closely related peptide vasopressin are known to play a role in social and repetitive behaviors. This study examined the impact of oxytocin on repetitive behaviors in 15 adults with autism or Asperger's disorder via randomized double-blind oxytocin and placebo challenges. The primary outcome measure was an instrument rating six repetitive behaviors: need to know, repeating, ordering, need to tell/ask, self-injury, and touching. Patients with autism spectrum disorders showed a significant reduction in repetitive behaviors following oxytocin infusion in comparison to placebo infusion. Repetitive behavior in autism spectrum disorders may be related to abnormalities in the oxytocin system, and may be partially ameliorated by synthetic oxytocin infusion.","The present study was undertaken in order to determine whether a set of clinical features, which are not included in the DSM-IV or ICD-10 for Asperger Syndrome (AS), are associated with AS in particular or whether they are merely a familial trait that is not related to the diagnosis.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""Asperger"" is primarily used to describe a subset of autism spectrum disorders characterized by specific repetitive behaviors and is considered a distinctive disorder within the broader autism spectrum. The text discusses clinical treatments aimed at alleviating symptoms specific to Asperger's disorder using medical interventions, in this case, oxytocin infusion.

In Text B, the term ""Asperger Syndrome (AS)"" is examined in a diagnostic context, focusing on whether certain clinical features align with DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Here, the term is addressed in terms of diagnostic classification, exploring traits that may or may not be exclusive to Asperger Syndrome versus being shared familial traits unrelated to the disorder.

The semantic drift from Text A to Text B highlights a shift from focusing on therapeutic interventions for a behaviorally defined group within the autism spectrum towards a more nuanced discussion about the diagnostic criteria and the definition of Asperger Syndrome itself. This change reflects an evolving understanding of Asperger Syndrome in the broader context of diagnostic standards and the differentiation or potential overlap of traits within family lines and other diagnoses."
77,Asperger,"Theory of mind (ToM) deficits are central to autistic spectrum disorders, including Asperger syndrome. Research in psychotic disorders has developed a cognitive model of paranoid delusions involving abnormal causal attributions for negative events. Possible aetiologies of these include deficits in social reasoning, specifically ToM. The present study investigated this attributional model of paranoia in Asperger syndrome. Participants diagnosed with Asperger syndrome scored significantly higher on a measure of paranoia and lower on a measure of ToM, compared with the control group. They did not differ in self-concept and causal attributions, contrary to the attributional model of paranoia. A regression analysis highlighted private self-consciousness as the only predictor of paranoia. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","Subjects with Asperger's syndrome without intellectual disabilities have significant difficulties in establishing social relationships despite their IQ being within the normal range. One of the effects of social deficit is depression. The question arises whether loneliness and dimensions of meaning in life correlate with the severity of depression and whether the average severity of depression, loneliness and dimensions of meaning in life differentiate the following groups: people with Asperger's syndrome and depression, people with Asperger's syndrome without depression, people with depression without Asperger's syndrome and healthy subjects. The study was conducted on a total of 170 people, including: 43 people with Asperger's syndrome and depression, 41 people with Asperger's syndrome without depression, 40 people with depression without Asperger's syndrome and 46 healthy people (without Asperger's syndrome and without depression). All were administered a demographic survey, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Life Attitude Profile-Revised. Asperger's syndrome and depressive episodes were diagnosed on the basis of ICD-10 research criteria still applicable in Poland. In the group with Asperger's syndrome and depression the highest levels of loneliness and the lowest values of the dimensions of the sense of meaning in life, except for the acceptance of death, were observed. This result was significantly different from the results obtained in the other study groups. Both in people with Asperger's syndrome without depression and in people with depression without Asperger's syndrome, the values of the dimensions of the sense of meaning in life and the level of loneliness differ significantly from the results obtained in the control group. The BDI-II scores correlated positively with the loneliness values and negatively with the sense of meaning in life values in all groups. The results indicate that both suffering from depression and having Asperger's syndrome are associated with an increased sense of loneliness and a reduced sense of meaning in life. People with Asperger's syndrome and depression have the highest values of loneliness and the lowest values of dimensions of the sense of meaning of life compared to the other groups studied. The limitation of the work is the deliberate selection of groups, because it would be interesting to answer the question whether Asperger's syndrome is a risk factor for depression in the population.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" is used consistently to refer to Asperger Syndrome, a disorder on the autism spectrum. Despite the different focuses in the contexts of the two texts, the essential definition of ""Asperger"" as relating to a specific autism spectrum condition does not alter. Text A explores the cognitive aspects and psychological implications associated with Asperger Syndrome, particularly in relation to paranoia and theory of mind deficits. Text B investigates the interplay between Asperger Syndrome and depression, with an emphasis on social and emotional impacts. Therefore, the underlying semantic usage of ""Asperger"" as denoting a particular type of autism spectrum disorder remains stable across the two texts."
78,Asperger,"Research has shown that individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome are impaired in humor appreciation, although anecdotal and parental reports provide some evidence to the contrary. This paper reviews the cognitive and affective processes involved in humor and recent neurological findings. It examines humor expression and understanding in autism and Asperger syndrome in the context of the main psychological theories (Theory of Mind, Executive Functions, Weak Central Coherence and Laterization models) and associated neural substrates. In the concluding sections, examples of humor displayed by individuals with autism/Asperger syndrome which appear to challenge the above theories are analyzed and areas for further research are suggested.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed on the basis of behavioral symptoms, but cognitive abilities may also be useful in characterizing individuals with ASD. One hundred seventy-eight high-functioning male adults, half with ASD and half without, completed tasks assessing IQ, a broad range of cognitive skills, and autistic and comorbid symptomatology. The aims of the study were, first, to determine whether significant differences existed between cases and controls on cognitive tasks, and whether cognitive profiles, derived using a multivariate classification method with data from multiple cognitive tasks, could distinguish between the two groups. Second, to establish whether cognitive skill level was correlated with degree of autistic symptom severity, and third, whether cognitive skill level was correlated with degree of comorbid psychopathology. Fourth, cognitive characteristics of individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) were compared. After controlling for IQ, ASD and control groups scored significantly differently on tasks of social cognition, motor performance, and executive function (P's < 0.05). To investigate cognitive profiles, 12 variables were entered into a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved good classification accuracy (81%) at a level significantly better than chance (P < 0.0001). After correcting for multiple correlations, there were no significant associations between cognitive performance and severity of either autistic or comorbid symptomatology. There were no significant differences between AS and HFA groups on the cognitive tasks. Cognitive classification models could be a useful aid to the diagnostic process when used in conjunction with other data sources-including clinical history.","### Label: Changed

### Reason:
In Text A, the target word ""Asperger"" is used explicitly to refer to Asperger syndrome as a distinct diagnosis within the autism spectrum, emphasizing its unique characteristics in cognitive and affective processes like humor appreciation. The text examines how individuals diagnosed specifically with Asperger syndrome differ in their cognitive function from others, mainly focusing on the context of humor.

However, in Text B, the term ""Asperger"" is used in a comparative manner alongside high-functioning autism (HFA) within the broad category of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The text analyzes cognitive differences and similarities between these subgroups but eventually highlights the findings that there are no significant differences in cognitive performances between individuals classified with Asperger Syndrome and high-functioning autism. This suggests a shift towards viewing ""Asperger Syndrome"" and ""high-functioning autism"" under a more unified or less distinct framework within ASD, rather than as separate or distinctly different diagnoses.

This shift indicates a semantic drift in the usage of ""Asperger"", moving from a term that denotes a distinct condition (as seen in Text A) to one that is increasingly integrated into a broader ASD diagnosis, reflecting changes in diagnostic approaches and classifications over time. Thus, the term ""Asperger"" has undergone a notable change in its usage and connotation between the two periods."
79,Asperger,"We describe the coexistence of Asperger and Tourette syndromes (AS and TS) caused by discrete hypoxic-ischaemic necrosis of the midbrain, infrathalamic and thalamic nuclei, and striatum in an adolescent male with positive family history for tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Behavioural ratings, cognitive tests, and volumetric measurements of the basal ganglia were performed in the patient and five other individuals with AS-TS unassociated with MRI lesions. Cognitive deficits in attentional, executive, and visual-spatial domains were found both in the patient and control AS-TS group, though deficits were more severe in the former. MRI showed reduction of the left basal ganglia volume compared with the right in the patient, whereas the control group showed reduction of right basal ganglia volume compared with the left. It is suggested that individuals with a genetic predisposition to TS may develop AS and TS after involvement of midbrain and related components of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits normally implicated in the integration of emotional, cognitive, and motor functions.","A case of Asperger's syndrome with unusual cerebral pathological changes is reported. A 22-year-old male had been having diagnostic Asperger's syndrome since the age of eight and had epilepsy during the past two years. Radiological studies revealed a focal intra-axial cortical and subcortical cerebral lesion with hyper-intensity and non-enhancing contrast in the left frontal lobe. Histological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the lesion consisted of cortical laminar disorganization, neuronal dysmorphism and increased heterotopic neurons in sub-cortical white matter. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Asperger's syndrome with focal cerebral pathological abnormalities rather than mini-columnar changes and the gyrial malformation reported in the literature. ","###Answer:
- Target word: Asperger
- Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the term ""Asperger"" remains consistent in context and meaning, associating it with a neurodevelopmental disorder forming part of the autism spectrum. Both texts discuss the syndrome in relation to physical and neuroanatomical abnormalities, confirming that the core understanding of Asperger's as a neurodevelopmental issue remains largely unchanged between the studies. While each text highlights specific cases with unique complications or observations (such as coexistence with Tourette syndrome in Text A and unusual cerebral pathological changes in Text B), the fundamental context and application of ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger's syndrome"" strongly ties back to its established medical and psychological implications, reflecting no significant semantic drift over the period considered."
80,Asperger,"Asperger disorder is a complex behavioral disorder that may be related to autism. We examined a 49-year-old man with Asperger disorder who had multiple neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities, including colobomatous defects involving the optic discs and peripapillary retina, and abnormal ocular motility with an oculocephalic dyskinesia. Asperger disorder may be associated with a variety of neuro-ophthalmologic disturbances.","We conducted a 5-year follow-up systematic review and meta-analysis to determine change in frequency of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis since diagnostic and statistical manual 5 (DSM-5) publication and explore the impact of Social Communication Disorder (SCD). For 33 included studies, use of DSM-5 criteria suggests decreases in diagnosis for ASD [20.8% (16.0-26.7), p < 0.001], DSM-IV-TR Autistic Disorder [10.1% (6.2-16.0), p < 0.001], and Asperger's [23.3% (12.9-38.5), p = 0.001]; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified decrease was not significant [46.1% (34.6-58.0), p = 0.52]. Less than one-third [28.8% (13.9-50.5), p = 0.06] of individuals diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR but not DSM-5 ASD would qualify for SCD. Findings suggest smaller decreases in ASD diagnoses compared to earlier reviews. Future research is needed as concerns remain for impaired individuals without a diagnosis.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, ""Asperger"" is used in a clinical context pertaining specifically to a diagnosis with distinct neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms as part of Asperger disorder, highlighting its individual identification within the autism spectrum disorders. In contrast, Text B reflects a significant update in psychiatric classification where the use of ""Asperger"" as a distinct diagnosis has been reviewed and essentially absorbed under a broader definition of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with the publication of DSM-5. The term's meaning and diagnostic criteria have shifted to no longer distinguish Asperger's as a separate entity but as part of a wider spectrum, significantly changing its clinical connotation and diagnostic usage."
81,Asperger,"This paper describes a total population study of Asperger syndrome using a two-stage procedure. All school children in an outer Göteborg borough were screened. Final case selection based on clinical work-up showed a minimum prevalence of 3.6 per 1.000 children (7-16 years of age) using Gillberg and Gillberg's criteria and a male to female ratio of 4:1. Including suspected and possible Asperger syndrome cases, the prevalence rose to 7.1 per 1.000 children and the male:female ratio dropped to 2.3:1. These findings are discussed as they relate to previously published results in the field and to findings obtained using Szatmari et al.'s and ICD-10 draft criteria for the disorder.",It is a case report of improvement of tactile defensiveness after taking sertraline in a woman with major depressive disorder and Asperger's syndrome.,"- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum characterized by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Text A provides epidemiological data and diagnostic criteria about Asperger syndrome, focusing on prevalence and gender ratios. Text B mentions Asperger's syndrome in the context of a clinical case involving a woman with major depressive disorder, indicating it as part of her diagnosis. Despite the different contexts (epidemiological study versus clinical case report), the fundamental reference to Asperger syndrome remains constant, focusing on it as a distinct diagnostic category of autism spectrum disorders without a shift in meaning or connotation over the time periods contrasted."
82,Asperger,"The question of whether Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism should be considered as the same or different conditions has been a source of debate and controversy over recent years. In the present study, 34 adults with autism who had shown early delays in language were compared with 42 individuals who were reported to have had no such delays, either in their use of words or phrases. All participants were at least 18 years of age, had a nonverbal IQ of 70 or above and met ADI-R criteria for age of onset, communication and social impairments, and stereotyped behaviors. Those in the language delay group were diagnosed as having high-functioning autism. The remainder were designated as having Asperger syndrome. The groups were matched for age, nonverbal IQ and gender. No significant differences were found between the groups either in their total ADI-R algorithm scores, or in their algorithm scores on individual domains. Social outcome ratings and ADI-R scores based on current functioning also failed to differentiate between the groups. Scores on tests of language comprehension and expression were also similar, but in both groups language abilities were well below chronological age level. The implications of these results with respect to the differences between Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are discussed. The poor performance on language tests also challenges the assumption that early language development in Asperger syndrome is essentially normal.","The differential diagnosis of dissociative disorders includes many psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders (especially bipolar II disorder), depressive disorder (especially atypical depression), epilepsy, Asperger syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. The theme of this paper is the differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia. Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia are common in dissociative disorders, especially in dissociative identity disorder (DID). Many DID patients have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenics and treated with neuroleptics. We compared and examined Schneiderian symptoms of schizophrenia and those of dissociative disorders from a structural viewpoint. In dissociative disorders, delusional perception and somatic passivity are not seen. ""Lateness"" and ""Precedence of the Other"" originated from the concept of ""Pattern Reversal"" (H.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger syndrome"" is consistently referenced as a specific category or diagnosis within the broader context of autism spectrum disorders. Text A deals primarily with the clinical classification and differentiation between Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism, while Text B discusses Asperger syndrome within the context of differential diagnosis of various psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and dissociative disorders. In both contexts, Asperger syndrome is recognized as a distinct condition with particular clinical features that need to be identified and differentiated from other disorders. There has not been a significant shift in the meaning or connotation of the term ""Asperger"" itself between the two texts despite their slightly different focus in the field of mental health."
83,Asperger,"A total population study of children, aged 13 years and under, suggested that there has been an apparent rise in the frequency of autistic disorder and autistic-like conditions (excluding Asperger's syndrome) in one area of western Sweden over the last ten years. The frequency was 4.0/100,000 in 1980, 7.5/10,000 in 1984 and 11.6/10,000 in 1988 in the city of Göteborg. Even though the prevalence rates refer to slightly different age cohorts, it was concluded that the apparent increase is in part due to better detection, but also to new cases born to immigrant parents. Typical cases of autistic disorder accounted for 75% of cases, and 20% had normal or near-normal IQs.","Sleep problems are commonly reported in children with autistic disorders. Most studies are based on sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, but polysomnographic and actigraphic data have also been used. In this study we investigated sleep in older individuals (aged 15-25 years) with autism and Asperger syndrome, using sleep questionnaires, sleep diaries and actigraphy. Although the sleep questionnaires completed by parents and caretakers revealed only a moderate degree of sleep problems, greater sleep disturbance was recorded with actigraphy. Using the latter method, low sleep efficiency (below 85 percent) or long sleep latency (more than 30 minutes) were found in 80 percent of the individuals. There was no early morning awakening, contrary to some earlier reports. This study suggests that even though subjective complaints of sleep disturbances are less common in adolescents and young adults with autism, this may be due to an adaptation process rather than an actual reduction in sleep disturbances.","### Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" (related to Asperger syndrome) consistently refers to a specific category within the broader autistic spectrum disorders. Text A primarily discusses the prevalence and detection rates of autistic disorders including Asperger’s syndrome, while Text B examines sleep disturbances in individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome. Despite different focal points (prevalence vs. sleep studies), the use of the term ""Asperger"" in both contexts does not diverge from its association with a particular form of autism spectrum disorder characterized by certain developmental differences. The core meaning of the term remains stable across both periods, highlighting it as a distinct subtype of autism, maintaining its diagnostic and categorical usage."
84,Asperger,"DSM-IV states that Asperger Disorder may be distinguished from Autistic Disorder by a lack of a delay in early language development. The aim of this study was to establish whether the presence or absence of early language delay would predict autistic symptomatology in children diagnosed with a PDD/autism spectrum disorder. Forty-six language-delayed and 62 normal language onset individuals (M age 11 years) were compared on ICD-10 research criteria and DSM-IV criteria, receptive language, and developmental history variables. Retrospective data were also obtained to determine whether language onset predicted autism symptomatology when young (< 6 years). We found that early language delay predicts more autistic symptomatology when young, but not at an older age. Early language delay is also associated with developmental motor milestone delays and lower receptive language abilities. The results question the use of early language delay as a valid discriminating variable between PDD subgroups.","This paper highlights the clinical challenges faced when assessing patients with stalking behaviors with psychotic disorders, suggesting the need for an accurate assessment of adult autism spectrum symptoms.

When assessed for adult autism spectrum symptoms upon an accurate clinical evaluation, he reported elevated scores in the mentalizing deficit and social anxiety domains by means of the 14 item Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale (RAADS-14). Authors discuss a possible role of adult (subthreshold) autism spectrum symptoms, generally disregarded in adult psychiatry, on the type of psychotic features and stalking behavior developed that may help for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" (related to Asperger Disorder or autism spectrum symptoms) consistently refers to a subset within autism spectrum disorders characterized by certain specific traits or symptoms. In Text A, the concept is discussed in the context of differentiating Asperger Disorder from Autistic Disorder based on early language development and its implications on autism spectrum symptomatology during different stages of development. Text B, meanwhile, explores adult assessments, specifically mentioning Asperger's in the context of identifying and understanding adult autism spectrum symptoms and their impact on behavior (such as stalking in the context of psychosis).

In both texts, despite different application settings (developmental versus adult psychiatric assessment), the fundamental use of ""Asperger"" to denote a spectrum within broader autism-related diagnoses remains consistent. Neither text diverges fundamentally in denoting a change in the definition, diagnostic criteria, or conceptual understanding of Asperger's, pointing towards an unchanged semantic use of the term over time."
85,Asperger,"Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4% of men did so. Twice as many men (40%) as women (21%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6% of the student sample scored 32+ on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component whose knowledge evolves quickly. Next-generation sequencing is the only effective technology to deal with the high genetic heterogeneity of ASD in a clinical setting. However, rigorous criteria to classify rare genetic variants conferring ASD susceptibility are currently lacking. We have performed whole-exome sequencing to identify both nucleotide variants and copy number variants (CNVs) in 253 ASD patients, including 68 patients with intellectual disability (ID) and 90 diagnosed as Asperger syndrome. Using explicit criteria to classify both susceptibility genes and susceptibility variants we prioritized 217 genes belonging to the following categories: syndromic genes, genes with an excess of de novo protein truncating variants and genes targeted by rare CNVs. We obtained a susceptibility variant detection rate of 19.7% (95% CI: [15-25.2%]). The rate for CNVs was 7.1% (95% CI: [4.3-11%]) and 12.6% (95% CI: [8.8-17.4%]) for nucleotide variants. The highest rate (30.1%, 95% CI: [20.2-43.2%]) was obtained in the ASD + ID subgroup. A strong contributor for at risk nucleotide variants was the recently identified set of genes (n = 81) harboring an excess of de novo protein truncating variants. Since there is currently no evidence that the genes targeted here are necessary and sufficient to cause ASD, we recommend to avoid the term ""causative of ASD"" when delivering the information about a variant to a family and to use instead the term ""genetic susceptibility factor contributing to ASD"".","### Label: Unchanged

One hundred males aged 5 years 6 months to 24 years 6 months, with a mean age of 11 years 4 months (SD 3y 10mo), who had a clinical diagnosis of AS were included in the study. An in-depth review of their medical records and neuropsychological test data was performed. There was a high rate (51%) of non-verbal learning disability (defined as Verbal IQ more than 15 points higher than Performance IQ), but otherwise there was little or no support for the notion of right-hemisphere brain dysfunction being at the core of the syndrome. There was a very high rate of close relatives with autism spectrum problems, but also high rates of prenatal and perinatal problems, including prematurity and postmaturity. In comparison with general population data, those with AS very often had a combination of genetic and prenatal and perinatal risk factors. Non-verbal learning disability test results applied in about half the group. There was a subgroup of individuals with AS who had macrocephalus. However, there was no support for an association of AS with low body mass index.","Although daily hassles and coping are associated with behavior and emotional problems in non-clinical populations, few studies have investigated these relationships in individuals with high-functioning autism/Asperger's Disorder (HFASD). This study examined the relationships between daily hassles, coping and behavior and emotional problems in adolescents with HFASD. Thirty-one adolescents with HFASD completed questionnaires assessing their coping and behavior and emotional problems, and completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment run via a mobile phone application on their coping and daily hassles. Parents completed questionnaires of the adolescents' daily hassles, coping, and behavior and emotional problems. The disengagement coping style was associated with significantly higher levels of behavior and emotional problems regardless of respondent or methodology, suggesting it may be a valuable target for intervention.

- Reason: The term ""Asperger"" (or ""Asperger syndrome"" and ""Asperger's Disorder"" in full) retains a similar context and connotation when analyzed between the two texts. In both Text A and Text B, ""Asperger"" refers to a form of autism spectrum disorder characterized chiefly by social and communication difficulties and repetitive or restricted patterns of behavior and interests. Text A focuses more on clinical observations, background, and associated cognitive and developmental attributes of individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Text B, meanwhile, addresses behavioral and emotional challenges faced by adolescents with High Functioning Autism/Asperger's Disorder (HFASD), also underlining similar psycho-social and developmental themes. The semantic field surrounding ""Asperger"" remains consistent in terms of referring to a specific set of developmental and clinical characteristics within the autism spectrum, without a notable shift in meaning or application in different contexts over the span between the two texts."
88,Asperger,"Two cognitive anomalies have been found in autism: a superiority on the Embedded Figures Task and a deficit in ""theory of mind."" Using adult-level versions of these tasks, the present study investigated if parents of children with Asperger Syndrome might show a mild variant of these anomalies, as might be predicted from a genetic hypothesis. Significant differences were found on both measures. Parents were significantly faster than controls on the Embedded Figures Task and slightly but significantly less accurate at interpreting photographs of the eye region of the face in terms of mental states. The results are discussed in terms of the broader cognitive phenotype of Asperger Syndrome and in terms of their implications for cognitive neuroscientific theories of the condition. ","The question of whether Asperger syndrome can be distinguished from autism has attracted much debate and may even incur delay in diagnosis and intervention. Accordingly, there has been a proposal for Asperger syndrome to be subsumed under autism in the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, in 2013. One approach to resolve this question has been to adopt the criterion of absence of clinically significant language or cognitive delay--essentially, the ""absence of language delay."" To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of people with autism to compare absence with presence of language delay. It capitalizes on the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to systematically explore the whole brain for anatomic correlates of delay and no delay in language acquisition in people with autism spectrum disorders.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""Asperger"" is discussed in the specific context of Asperger Syndrome as a distinct diagnostic entity, with cognitive anomalies compared between parents of children with Asperger Syndrome and controls, focusing on genetic hypotheses and cognitive traits specific to the syndrome. However, in Text B, the semantic usage of ""Asperger"" shifts towards considering its diagnostic indistinguishability from broader autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The text argues for the potential subsuming of Asperger syndrome under a broader autism diagnosis in the upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, reflecting a shift in understanding towards a less distinct and more integrated view of Asperger syndrome within ASDs. This change illustrates the evolving nature of its classification and understanding within the psychiatric and medical communities."
89,Asperger,"The validity of Asperger syndrome (i.e., apart from high-functioning autism) continues to be the topic of considerable debate. Consistent with Asperger's original description of the condition there appear to be some important potential differences from autism if both conditions are strictly defined. Although the importance of genetic factors in the transmission of autism is increasingly clear it also appears that genetic factors may play an even more important role in Asperger syndrome (AS). The nosological validity of this condition and its relation to the various PDD spectrum disorder remains an important topic for future research. Well-designed and carefully controlled studies are needed in which patterns of comorbidity and associated problems in family members can be carefully assessed. Such studies will contribute to our understanding of the relationship of AS and autism and may clarify important genetic mechanisms of relevance to autism.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include three main conditions: autistic disorder (AD), pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. It has been shown that many genes associated with ASDs are involved in the neuroligin-neurexin interaction at the glutamate synapse: NLGN3, NLGN4, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, and SHANK3. We screened this last gene in two cohorts of ASD patients (133 patients from US and 88 from Italy). We found 5/221 (2.3%) cases with pathogenic alterations: a 106 kb deletion encompassing the SHANK3 gene, two frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons, a missense mutation (p.Pro141Ala), and a splicing mutation (c.1820-4 G>A). Additionally, in 17 patients (7.7%) we detected a c.1304+48C>T transition affecting a methylated cytosine in a CpG island. This variant is reported as SNP rs76224556 and was found in both US and Italian controls, but it results significantly more frequent in our cases than in the control cohorts. The variant is also significantly more common among PDD-NOS cases than in AD cases. We also screened this gene in an independent replication cohort of 104 US patients with ASDs, in which we found a missense mutation (p.Ala1468Ser) in 1 patient (0.9%), and in 8 patients (7.7%) we detected the c.1304+48C>T transition. While SHANK3 variants are present in any ASD subtype, the SNP rs76224556 appears to be significantly associated with PDD-NOS cases. This represents the first evidence of a genotype-phenotype correlation in ASDs and highlights the importance of a detailed clinical-neuropsychiatric evaluation for the effective genetic screening of ASD patients.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger syndrome"" is primarily connected with a form of autism or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), which is consistent across the two texts despite them being from different time periods.

- **Text A** discusses Asperger syndrome as a distinct condition from other forms of autism but still under the wider umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), emphasizing genetic factors and the ongoing debate over its nosological status (classification and diagnostic criteria). It acknowledges the unique clinical presentations consistent with Asperger's original descriptions, which include potential differences compared to other autism forms if strictly defined.
  
- **Text B** similarly includes Asperger syndrome within the category of ASDs, describing it alongside other disorders such as autistic disorder (AD) and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It points out the genetic studies conducted which involve Asperger syndrome as part of broader ASD research, further supporting the genetic linkage and its impact on neuroligin-neurexin interaction which is crucial for synaptic development—consistent with the discussions in Text A about genetic relevance.

Both texts situate Asperger syndrome within the broader framework of Autism Spectrum Disorders and focus on the genetic and clinical aspects of the disorder. Despite the advancement in genetic research methods and deeper understandings of gene involvement over time (as indicated in Text B), the fundamental conceptualization of ""Asperger syndrome"" as a form on the autism spectrum remains largely the same. Thus, the term has not undergone significant semantic drift in its use and understanding between the time periods represented by Text A and Text B."
90,Asperger,"Gender is a concept that is frequently discussed in the literature on stress, coping and illness. Research has reported that women are more vulnerable than men are to stressful events and use different strategies to cope with them. Furthermore, it is often asserted that these gender-based differences in coping may partially explain the differential impact of stressful events on men and women. Unfortunately, much of this research has equated gender with sex and failed to contextualise the experience of illness and coping. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the role of gender and coping among parents of children with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in an Australian sample. It attempts to analyse the different meanings of the disability for mothers and fathers and describes the various strategies that parents use to cope with their child's disability.","Mentalizing refers to making inferences about other people's mental states, whereas visuospatial perspective taking refers to inferring other people's viewpoints. Both abilities seem vital for social functioning; yet, their exact relationship is unclear. We directly compared mentalizing and visuospatial perspective taking in nineteen adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and fifteen control participants with the same stimulus material. Stimuli depicted virtual characters surrounded by two different objects. Virtual characters expressed a preference for one of the objects indicated by facial expression, gestures or head/body orientation. Compared to controls, participants with AS showed significantly increased reaction times and decreased accuracy for mentalizing (i.e., when inferring the virtual character's preference from the character's nonverbal bodily cues). By contrast, there were no significant group differences in perspective taking (i.e., by mental own-body transformations). These findings demonstrate, first, specific deficits in AS when mental states have to be inferred from nonverbal social cues. Second, visuospatial perspective taking may not necessarily be related to social impairments occurring in autism spectrum disorders.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" refers to Asperger Syndrome (AS), a condition on the autism spectrum characterized by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors. Text A discusses coping mechanisms among parents of children with Asperger's syndrome, emphasizing its impact on family dynamics and coping strategies in a social context. Text B explores the cognitive dimensions of Asperger Syndrome, particularly focusing on difficulties in mentalizing and perspective taking in social interactions among adults with AS. Despite the different focuses of these texts, the essential definition and understanding of Asperger Syndrome as a specific autism spectrum disorder with unique social and cognitive challenges remains consistent between both texts. Thus, the meaning of the word ""Asperger"" has not undergone significant semantic drift over the examined periods."
91,Asperger,"The case of a young man is presented who initially appeared to be quite normal and very intelligent, if somewhat immature. Profound prosopagnosia was discovered in the course of a psychological assessment. Closer investigation revealed definite autistic features of the Asperger type, and both conditions ran in the family in a milder form. Questions arising from observations and experiments as well as from the case history are discussed, and an attempt is made to elucidate some problems in the light of the original theories about these conditions. It is suggested that prosopagnosia may be an essential symptom in one of the autism spectrum disorders, perhaps of a specific subgroup of Asperger syndrome. Visual hypo-emotionality is suggested as a possible common denominator of the two conditions.",Spontaneous classification was assessed using a free serial search task in 18 school-aged children at the high functioning end of the autistic spectrum and compared with results from age-matched typically developing controls. The task required participants to touch shapes in an exhaustive non-repetitive sequence. The positions of the items varied randomly between touches. The objective was to measure the extent to which children with autism and Asperger's syndrome could spontaneously utilise category information such as shape and color to organise their search. There were no group differences on measures of sequential control and levels of categorization once age and IQ had been partialled out. The results are contrasted with findings from the same lab using a size seriation task.,"###Answer:
- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Asperger"" refers to a form of autism, specifically part of the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Text A delves into a psychological case study where the individual exhibits autistic features specific to Asperger Syndrome, alongside an associated condition (prosopagnosia) and familial links to the same. On the other hand, Text B explores cognitive abilities in children with Asperger's syndrome, focusing on their capacity to categorize information in cognitive tasks compared to neurotypical controls. 

In both texts, the usage of ""Asperger"" pertains directly to the same underlying reference—Asperger's syndrome as a distinct form within the spectrum of autism disorders, which affects social interaction and cognitive organization without a significant change in the overall understanding or conceptual framing of the condition. The contexts show different aspects and research focuses but retain the core clinical gist of Asperger's as situated within autism spectrum conditions."
92,Asperger,"A case report is presented of an 11-year-old boy who has been diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome. There follows a review of the clinical features, course, prognosis and management of this condition.","Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) affect more males than females. This suggests that the neurobiology of autism: 1) may overlap with mechanisms underlying typical sex-differentiation or 2) alternately reflect sex-specificity in how autism is expressed in males and females. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test these alternate hypotheses. Fifteen men and fourteen women with Asperger syndrome (AS), and sixteen typically developing men and sixteen typically developing women underwent fMRI during performance of mental rotation and verbal fluency tasks. All groups performed the tasks equally well. On the verbal fluency task, despite equivalent task-performance, both males and females with AS showed enhanced activation of left occipitoparietal and inferior prefrontal activity compared to controls. During mental rotation, there was a significant diagnosis-by-sex interaction across occipital, temporal, parietal, middle frontal regions, with greater activation in AS males and typical females compared to AS females and typical males. These findings suggest a complex relationship between autism and sex that is differentially expressed in verbal and visuospatial domains.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger syndrome"" refers to a specific neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests, which forms part of the broader autism spectrum. In Text A, the mention of Asperger's syndrome is focused on diagnosing and understanding the clinical features and management of the condition. In Text B, although there is a discussion about the neurobiological and sex-specific aspects using fMRI studies, the core reference to ""Asperger syndrome"" still pertains to it being a part of the autism spectrum conditions with specific manifestations that warrant such study. There is no change in the fundamental meaning or representation of Asperger syndrome as a form of autism spectrum disorder. Thus, the semantic understanding of the term remains consistent over the two texts."
93,Asperger,"Asperger's Syndrome is a distinct variant of autism, with a prevalence rate of 10 to 26 per 10,000 of normal intelligence, and 0.4 per 10,000 in those with mild mental retardation. The syndrome now has its own clinical entity and diagnostic criteria. It is being officially listed in the ICD-10 under pervasive developmental disorder. Two such cases are described in this article. Case One lacked the ability to relate to others, was excessively preoccupied with the late actor P. Ramlee and demonstrated a peculiar behaviour of holding on to toothbrushes in his early childhood. Cognitively, he was unable to synthesise words into meaningful sentences. Similarly, Case Two was unable to relate well to others and was preoccupied with the planets and its constellations. Though he appeared intelligent with an IQ score of 101, he was unable to follow instructions at school. Both children had motor clumsiness and fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome.","A variant of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) known as Asperger syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe issues with interpersonal, verbal, and nonverbal communication as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and activities. Although there is no known cause for ASD, various genetic as well as non-genetic risk factors that may act either alone or in combination to induce ASD have been identified. The occurrence of ASD has been increasing worldwide. Co-occurring neuropsychological diseases are frequently present as well. The premise for diagnosis is the observation of abnormal conduct, with diagnostic criteria emphasizing limitations in social interaction and communication as well as constrained, repetitive behavioral patterns, activities, or hobbies. The degree of the illness and the presence of intellectual impairment have a significant impact on the prognosis. Like autism, Asperger's can neither be prevented nor treated. There is no specific medical therapy that can effectively cure all of the symptoms of autism. However, medications may be used as adjuvant therapy for maladaptive behaviors and co-occurring mental problems. The treatment aims to reduce core impairments, increase functional ability, and reduce harmful behaviors that could limit functional skills. It is crucial to provide proper care, establish supportive networks for individuals who are affected and their families, and use effective therapies to enhance functioning and results.","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The use of the term ""Asperger"" in both Text A and Text B reflects a description associated with a variant of autism, highlighting challenges related to social interactions, communication, and restrictive repetitive patterns of behavior. Text A describes Asperger's Syndrome through case studies, emphasizing diagnostic criteria and behavioral descriptions specific to the syndrome. Text B expands upon these aspects within the broader categorization under Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including potential co-occurring conditions and treatment approaches. Despite differences in detail and context (Text A focuses on individual cases and specific behaviors, while Text B discusses broader ASD aspects and management approaches), the fundamental definition of Asperger as a form of autism characterized by specific behavioral patterns and cognitive aspects remains consistent. There is no significant shift in the semantic essence of the term ""Asperger"" between the two texts; it still specifically refers to a syndrome within the larger framework of autism spectrum disorders with clearly defined symptoms and diagnostic criteria."
94,Asperger,"The diagnostic criteria of Asperger's syndrome (AS), considered a part of the autistic spectrum disorder, are still unclear. A critical marker, which distinguishes AS from autism, is the presence of language. The ability of a child with AS to acquire and use language early results in the fact that AS usually is diagnosed much later than autism. Autism is not usually diagnosed until around the age of 3, whereas AS usually is not diagnosed until the child is 6 or 7 years of age. In the present article, using Eshkol-Wachman movement notation, we present evidence that abnormal movement patterns can be detected in AS in infancy. This finding suggests that AS can be diagnosed very early, independent of the presence of language. As shown earlier by us, almost all of the movement disturbances in autism can be interpreted as infantile reflexes ""gone astray""; i.e., some reflexes are not inhibited at the appropriate age in development, whereas others fail to appear when they should. This phenomenon appears to apply to AS as well. Based on preliminary results, a simple test using one such reflex is proposed for the early detection of a subgroup of children with AS or autism.","Prior investigations suggest that birth order position may be associated with the risk for developing a pervasive developmental disorder. This retrospective chart review examined the birth order status of 29 psychiatrically-referred patients with Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Eighty-six percent of the subjects were first born. The finding was statistically significant when compared to an expected random distribution of AS subjects χ(2) (1, N = 29) = 9.18, p < 0.01. The reasons for such an association are unclear though birth stoppage, obstetric complications, and immunological mechanisms may play a role.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger's Syndrome (AS)"" refers to a specific condition that is part of the broader category of autism spectrum disorders, characterized by particular diagnostic criteria though distinct in certain ways from other forms of autism. Text A discusses detailed aspects of diagnostic criteria and early identification based on cognitive and motor markers specific to Asperger's syndrome. Text B explores potential epidemiological factors influencing the incidence of Asperger's syndrome, specifically regarding birth order, but still within the clinical and diagnostic framework of the condition. Both texts, despite different focal points and depths of discussion, fundamentally treat ""Asperger"" as a specific autism spectrum disorder with unique criteria and implications, without any drastic shift or change in the general understanding of what Asperger's entails. Thus, the semantic context and usage of ""Asperger"" appears to remain consistent between the two texts."
95,Asperger,"Seven children and young adults with definite signs of Asperger syndrome were administered a battery of tests designed to test: intelligence; left and right cerebral hemisphere functioning; ability to discriminate eye gaze; and social judgment. The subjects revealed a non significant tendency to have a higher verbal IQ than visual IQ; and their right hemisphere functioning seemed impaired. They were also poorer at discriminating eye gaze and revealed difficulties in making hypothetical social judgments. The data are considered with reference to Rourke's (1988) work on non-verbal learning disabilities together with the ideas of Tantam (1992) on the ""social gaze response"" and Baron-Cohen's (1993) Eye-Detection Detector model. The possible links between social judgment and theory of mind (Frith, 1991) are briefly explored.","There are over 200,000 people in the UK diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome (AS).

###Reason:
The term ""Asperger"" or ""Asperger syndrome"" retains a consistent medical and diagnostic connotation across both texts, emphasizing its status as a long-term developmental disorder. In Text A, details focus on specific characteristics and cognitive aspects of individuals with Asperger syndrome, such as differences in verbal and visual IQ and challenges in social judgments and eye gaze discrimination. The text aligns closely with the clinical and psychological evaluation aspect of the disorder.

Text B acknowledges the historical and diagnostic framework of Asperger syndrome, reflecting on how many individuals might have been undiagnosed in the past due to its relatively recent formal recognition. This text speaks more to the societal and demographic aspects of the condition.

Both texts, despite their differing focuses—one on detailed clinical observations and the other on demographic and historical insights—still fundamentally refer to Asperger syndrome as a recognizable developmental disorder without straying into new meanings or connotations. Hence, the semantic drift for the word ""Asperger"" between the two texts is labeled ""Unchanged."""
96,Asperger,"Patients with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS) are impaired in mindreading and imitation skills. One possibility would be that their 'mirror neuron' system, which matches action execution and observation, does not function properly. To test this hypothesis we compared action-viewing related motor cortex functions in an AS group (one autistic and four AS subjects) and eight control subjects. In both groups viewing hand actions modified the neuromagnetic approximately 20 Hz oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex to the same extent. Thus impaired mindreading and imitation skills found in AS and autism do not seem to result from dysfunction of the motor cortex part of the action execution/observation system.","This study presents the case of a 4-year-old healthy child admitted to the paediatric ward for suspected accidental intoxication due to ingestion of narcoleptic drugs (methylphenidate, sertraline and quetiapine), taken on a regular basis by his 8-year-old brother affected by Asperger syndrome.Intoxication can be objectively assessed by measurements of drugs and metabolites in biological matrices with short-term (blood and urine) or long-term (hair) detection windows. At the hospital, the child's blood and urine were analysed by immunoassay (confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sertraline and quetiapine and their metabolites were identified. The suspicion that the mother administered drugs chronically prompted the analysis of six, consecutive 2-cm segments of the child's hair, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, thereby accounting for ingestion over the previous 12 months. Quetiapine was found in the first four segments with a mean concentration of 1.00 ng/mg ± 0.94 ng/mg hair while sertraline and its metabolite, desmethyl-sertraline, were found in all segments with a mean concentration of 2.65 ± 0.94 ng/mg and 1.50 ± 0.94 ng/mg hair, respectively. Hair analyses were negative for methylphenidate and its metabolite (ritalinic acid). Biological matrices testing for psychoactive drugs disclosed both acute and chronic intoxication with quetiapine and sertraline administered by the mother.

Text B presents a case study involving a child diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, with the focus on a related medical incident involving drug intoxication. Despite the different contexts (neurological research vs. medical case study), the term ""Asperger"" consistently refers to the same syndrome, identifying a specific group within the autism spectrum without any shift in its fundamental meaning or connotation between the texts. Thus, the semantic usage of ""Asperger"" remains unchanged across the two texts."
97,Asperger,"Previous work suggests children with autism show superior performance (in relation to their general mental age) on the Embedded Figures Test (EFT). Frith interprets this as showing that they have ""weak central coherence"". In Experiment 1, using an adult level version of this task, we aimed to replicate and extend this finding, first, by collecting response time (RT) data; second, by testing adults with autism of normal intelligence; and third, by testing a group of adults with Asperger syndrome, in order to test for differences between autism and Asperger syndrome. Both clinical groups were significantly faster on the EFT. In Experiment 2, we investigated if this difference was due to a preference for local over global processing, using a novel drawing task based on the classical Rey Figure. The clinical groups did not differ significantly on this test, but there was a trend towards such a difference. Alternative explanations for the EFT superiority in autism and Asperger syndrome are considered.","In patients with a language developmental delay, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), specific language impairment, and mental retardation. It is important that pediatricians recognize the signs and symptoms of ASDs, as many patients with language developmental delays are ultimately diagnosed with ASDs. Pediatricians play an important role in the early recognition of ASDs, because they are usually the first point of contact for children with ASDs. A revision of the diagnostic criteria of ASDs was proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) that was released in May 2013. The autism spectrum describes a range of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders in the fifth edition of the DSM. The new diagnostic criteria encompasses previous elements from the diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified. An additional change to the DSM includes synthesizing the section on social and communication deficits into one domain. In ASD patients, the appropriate behavioral therapies and rehabilitation treatments significantly affect the prognosis. Therefore, this makes early diagnosis and treatment very important. In conclusion, pediatricians need to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of ASDs and be attentive to them in order to make an early diagnosis and provide treatment. ","- Label: Changed

In Text B, the use of ""Asperger"" has evolved significantly, aligning with the changes reflected in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), where Asperger syndrome has been subsumed under the broader category of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). This reflects a shift from viewing Asperger syndrome as distinct to viewing it as part of a spectrum, changing its standalone identity to a component of a broader diagnostic category.

It uses the term in the context of examining social influence and interaction patterns specific to those diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. Text B (from a later period) addresses clinical and neurological findings related to autism spectrum disorder, including Asperger’s syndrome, focusing on physical and developmental attributes like head size and brain weight. Although the emphasis and specifics of the research have evolved, the fundamental usage of the word ""Asperger"" relative to its association as a subset of autism spectrum disorder remains consistent.

The children of the second cluster (""communication problems"", 35%) were only described by social-communicative problems, and the third group did not show any problems (38%). The different cluster solutions will be discussed with a view to the new DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, for following studies a further specification of some of the ASDS and FSK items could be helpful.

  In Text A, ""Asperger"" refers directly to Asperger's Syndrome, a distinct and separate diagnosis focused on specific aspects distinct from other developmental and mood disorders. This shows the recognition and understanding of Asperger's as a specific condition at that time.
  In Text B, ""Asperger's Disorder"" is described in the context of the DSM-5, where it has been merged under a broader category called ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (ASD). This reflects a significant change in the diagnostic approach, moving away from viewing Asperger's as a separate entity, and instead incorporating it into a larger spectrum of disorders. The focus is shifted toward a more general grouping and the investigation of common symptoms in a broad cluster rather than distinct disorders.
  Therefore, the semantic context and conceptual understanding of ""Asperger"" have shifted significantly from being an independent diagnosis to being a part of a wider spectrum of disorders, marking a considerable change in its meaning and diagnostic application."
0,Emotional disorders,"Duodenal ulcer cure, as a systemic gastroenterologic disease, can be achieved in some patients by the addition of the nootropic drug piracetam to current antisecretory and antihelicobacter therapy. Piracetam corrects vegetative and psychoemotional disorders in duodenal ulcer, normalizes gastric motility, has an antioxidant effect and improves cerebral circulation. An optimal effect on clinico-endoscopic manifestations of recurrent duodenal ulcer was achieved in combination of piracetam with current antisecretory (omeprazole) and antihelicobacter (de-nol, amoxicillin, metronidazole) medicines. Such combination improves both short- and long-term outcomes of duodenal ulcer treatment.","Depression frequently develops in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, exacerbating the manifestations of the disease and making its management challenging. To date, no consensus has been reached regarding effective treatments for these sufferers due to limited understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for emotional disorders that are highly comorbid with this disease. There is an urgent need to rethink current treatment options for these patients. This article aims to optimize the treatment outcomes and improve the quality of life for MS patients. Based on an in-depth and critical review of the current literature, we provide a neurorehabilitative framework that explains possible regulatory mechanisms underlying the emotional symptoms highly developed in MS. This article offers practical knowledge and therapeutic strategies to optimize the treatment options in the current care system for MS, as well as for other disabling diseases. ","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used in the clinical context of managing physical symptoms associated with a gastrointestinal condition (duodenal ulcer), where it's implied that emotional disorders are interconnected with physiological responses and are addressed as part of the comprehensive treatment of the ulcer. The term is used to encompass a range of emotional and psychological disturbances that influence or are influenced by physical health.

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" refers specifically to emotional and psychological conditions stemming from or associated with another chronic disease (multiple sclerosis), highlighting a different dimension of complexity and interrelation between chronic illness and psychological health. Here, emotional disorders are treated as a significant comorbid condition requiring distinct therapeutic attention, separate from the primary disease but critically affecting its management and the patient's quality of life.

The shift between the texts from a more general and secondary condition linked with physical health to a primary, critical aspect of chronic disease management indicates a semantic drift in the term's usage and perceived importance within the healthcare context."
1,Emotional disorders,"The immunological (lymphocyte blast transformation with PHA, determination of IgA, IgM, IgG), cytochemical (the mean cytochemical index of neutrophil lipids, glycogen, peroxidase content), hematological (the leukocyte, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts), and biochemical tests were employed to study immune responsiveness in 108 patients with chronic non-calculous cholecystitis running a refractory relapsing course. The patients showed the signs of immune deficiency. Some of the above described tests turned out informative for detecting such deficiency. It has been demonstrated that conventional therapy does not provide any stable clinical effect, aggravating the manifestations of immune deficiency. The introduction into the complex of treatment measures of diphenhydramine, saparal and levamisole, in particular, favoured more rapid elimination of the clinical symptoms of a relapse, of allergic reactions, psychoemotional disorders and reduced the signs of a decrease in immune responsiveness in patients with chronic non calculous cholecystitis running a refractory relapsing course.","This review discusses the importance of the main psychosocial risk factors in the development of chronic non-communicable diseases. The current data on the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are presented. The article summarizes information about the relationship between the development of psychoemotional disorders and CVD, discusses the prospects for the management of such patients in the framework of interdisciplinary cooperation. The main pathogenetic mechanisms of the development of complications, including damage to the central nervous system during infection with a new coronavirus infection, are considered. The significance of the choice of pathogenetic therapy for patients with comorbid somatic and mental diseases in the conditions of a pandemic of a new coronavirus infection is assessed. The results of multicenter placebo-controlled studies on the use of fluvoxamine in patients with a new coronavirus infection of varying severity are discussed.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""psychoemotional disorders"" refers to conditions that affect the emotional and psychological well-being of individuals. In Text A, ""psychoemotional disorders"" are listed alongside other clinical symptoms and are considered as part of the adverse effects which the treatment aims to alleviate. Similarly, in Text B, ""psychoemotional disorders"" continues to signify mental health issues, specifically in the context of their relationship with chronic non-communicable diseases (CVD) and their management during the coronavirus pandemic. In both texts, despite different specific contexts and detailed usage, the underlying meaning of ""psychoemotional disorders"" as conditions impacting psychological and emotional health remains consistent. Hence, the semantic drift of the term ""psychoemotional disorders"" between the two time periods is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
2,Emotional disorders,"This study describes a non-pharmacological treatment modality for children with trichotillomania. Three children with trichotillomania were treated using a hypnotherapy technique. All patients were observed in the outpatient clinic for 8 consecutive weeks and subsequently followed for 12-18 months. All children were cooperative in performing the hypnotherapy technique (relaxation/mental imagery). Two patients reported complete resolution of their complaints after 7-8 weeks and 1 patient after 16 weeks. The latter, reporting recurrence of the complaint after 4 weeks due to stressful school problems, was resolved after successful retreatment over 3 weeks. During a mean follow-up period of 16 months, there were no recurrences. In conclusion, hypnotherapy may be considered as a primary treatment modality for trichotillomania in children without associated emotional disorders.","Interpretation bias is a crucial therapeutic target in emotional disorders. However, few studies have examined the role of interpretation bias in substance use disorders (SUDs). Our specific aims were: (1) to examine whether interpretation bias was associated with craving and abstinence self-efficacy, and (2) explore potential moderators of these associations, including anxiety severity, sex, and substance type.","###Answer:

- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe psychological conditions that affect emotions, mood, and behavior. In Text A, emotional disorders are mentioned in the context of not being associated with trichotillomania when treated with hypnotherapy, suggesting it's a distinguishing factor or a potential compounding issue in mental health treatments. Text B discusses interpretation bias within the context of emotional disorders, specifically how it affects therapeutic outcomes in substance use disorders (SUDs). In both instances, ""emotional disorders"" refers to psychological issues that involve emotional dysregulation or disturbances, indicating consistent usage and understanding of the term across both texts. Hence, the semantic meaning of ""emotional disorders"" remains stable between the different years of publication."
3,Emotional disorders,"Fifty four children were studied 1-14 (mean 5.6) years after fabrications of illness had been identified. Thirty of the 54 children were living in families with their biological mothers and 24 were with other family members or in substitute families. Further fabrications were identified for 10 children who had been living with their mothers and there were 'other concerns' for a further eight children. Thirteen children residing with mother and 14 not residing with mother at follow up had a range of disorders including conduct and emotional disorders, and problems related to school, including difficulties in attention and concentration and non-attendance. Overall, 20 children (49% of those successfully followed up) had outcomes that were considered to be unacceptable.","Structural models of emotional disorders propose that anxiety disorders can be classified into fear and distress disorders. Sources of evidence for this distinction come from genetic, self-report and neurophysiological data from adults. The present study examined whether this distinction relates to cognitive processes, indexed by attention bias towards threat, which is thought to cause and maintain anxiety disorders.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the usage of ""emotional disorders"" refers broadly to various affective problems that children experience as assessment outcomes after a specific circumstance of parental fabrications. It is used in a more general, colloquial context to encompass a range of disorders tied to emotional and behavioral disturbances.

In contrast, Text B uses ""emotional disorders"" in a more technical and specific context, referring to a structured model that classifies certain psychological conditions into distinct categories like ""fear"" and ""distress"" disorders. This usage reflects a more nuanced understanding and categorization within the realm of psychological research, indicating a shift from a broad use to a more delineated and scientifically defined concept in psychological discourse. This signifies a semantic drift in the term’s usage and context over time."
4,Emotional disorders,"A retrospective and longitudinal study was carried out on all children and adolescents who presented to a child psychiatry service over a period of 26 years to identify the nature, course, and outcome of cases meeting criteria for anorexia nervosa (n = 27). Two groups of the same age were identified for comparison, firstly those with food avoidance and emotional disorders (n = 23), and secondly those with emotional disorders but no symptoms associated with eating (n = 22). The results confirm previous reports that early onset anorexia nervosa shows a similar nature, course, and outcome to the adult disease. Being tall at presentation seems to be associated with a poor outcome. Self starvation of early onset may result in short stature in some cases. There seem to be more boys among the group in whom the disease was of early onset than would be predicted from the sex ratio among adult patients. In addition boys with anorexia nervosa may have a better prognosis than girls. Children with food avoidance emotional disorders seem to have a worse prognosis than expected for childhood emotional disorders. They may represent a middle group between those with anorexia nervosa and those with emotional disorders but no symptoms associated with eating.","  To investigate whether bullying and psychological conditions are correlated,
this study analyzed a survey of primary and secondary school students from
Zigong City, Sichuan Province. A total of 95,545 students completed a personal
information questionnaire, the Multidimensional Peer-Victimization Scale
(MPVS), and eight other scales pertaining to various psychological problems.
The data showed that 68,315 (71.5\%) participants experienced school bullying
at varying degrees, indicating the prevalence of bullying among adolescents.
The chi-square tests revealed a strong correlation between school bullying and
psychological conditions. This correlation was further explored through
multivariate logistic regression, showing that students who experienced mild
bullying had a 3.10 times higher probability of emotional and behavioral
problems, 4.06 times higher probability of experiencing prodromal symptoms of
mental illness, 4.72 times higher probability of anxiety, 3.28 times higher
probability of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , 4.07 times
higher probability of poor sleep quality, 3.13 times higher probability of
internet addiction, 2.18 times higher probability of poor mental health, and
3.64 times higher probability of depression than students who did not
experience bullying. The corresponding probabilities for students who
experienced severe bullying were 11.35, 17.35, 18.52, 12.59, 11.67, 12.03,
4.64, and 5.34 times higher, respectively. In conclusion, school bullying and
psychological conditions are significantly correlated among primary and
secondary school students, and the more severe the bullying, the higher the
probability to suffer from psychological problems.
","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is specifically tied to medical conditions where ""emotional disorders"" may coincide with psychophysiological conditions like anorexia nervosa, affecting eating behaviors and other emotional states. The context suggests a psychiatric and psychological framework focusing on interactions between mental health and physical symptoms (anorexia and food avoidance behaviors).

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" broaden significantly to encompass a wide range of psychological problems associated with the emotional and behavioral impact of bullying. These include anxiety, PTSD, symptoms of mental illness, and depression. The term here is used more inclusively to discuss a variety of psychological conditions potentially triggered or worsened by external social stressors such as bullying.

This semantic shift shows textual evidence that ""emotional disorders"" from a narrower, perhaps more clinically diagnosed condition (text A), has evolved into a broader term encapsulating various forms of psychological distress linked to different environmental triggers (text B)."
5,Emotional disorders,"A total of 232 (84%) first episodes of schizophrenia from our epidemiologically defined ABC sample (Age, Beginning and Course) were retrospectively assessed with regard to the onset and early course of the disorder. In a follow-up study a representative subgroup (n = 133) was prospectively examined in five cross sections over 3 years from first admission on. Population-based incidence rates for 5-year age groups comprising a range of < 10 - < 60 years were calculated on the basis of two definitions of onset: first sign of disorder and first psychotic symptom. In 40% of adult patients who had been admitted with a first schizophrenic episode after age 20 years the prodromal phase, in 11% the psychotic prephase, began before that age. This demonstrates that schizophrenia often begins in an age period in which the social and cognitive development and brain maturation are still unfinished. Early-onset schizophrenias (< or = 20 years) were compared with a medium-onset group (21 - < 35 years) and a late-onset group (35 - < 60 years) with regard to age and type of onset, early symptom-related course, social development and social course. The number of schizophrenia-specific positive and negative syndromes in early-onset schizophrenia is comparable to that of higher age groups. However, neurotic syndromes, emotional disorders and conduct disorders are most frequent in younger patients, especially in young men. Paranoid syndromes seem to prevail in late-onset schizophrenia, whereas less differentiated positive syndromes, such as delusional mood, are more frequent in the youngest age group. An earlier onset of schizophrenia has more severe social consequences than onset in adults, because it interrupts the cognitive and social development at an earlier stage. The worse social course of schizophrenia in men compared with women cannot be related to a more severe symptomatology, but to the earlier age at onset and the impairment or stagnation of social ascent at an earlier stage of social and cognitive development. Social disability in the sense of an adaptation to the expectations of the social environment, as well as symptomatology during the further course of schizophrenia, show no major differences between the genders nor between the age groups.","Transdiagnostic group cognitive behavior therapy (TD-GCBT) has shown to be efficacious in the treatment of emotional disorders in primary care. However, little is known about possible moderators or predictors of treatment outcome. We aimed to explore the potential predictors and moderators of outcome in a large multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing TD-GCBT plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone.","###Answer:
- Target word: Emotional disorders
- Text A: The passage primarily discusses various aspects of schizophrenia, including age of onset and symptoms across different age groups. It mentions ""emotional disorders"" in the context of being a symptom spectrum that is more frequently observed in younger patients, especially men, alongside neurotic and conduct disorders.

- Text B: Discusses the use of transdiagnostic group cognitive behavior therapy (TD-GCBT) specifically for treating ""emotional disorders"" in a primary care setting. The context implies that emotional disorders are considered a treatable set of conditions, likely inclusive of a range of disorders including but not necessarily limited to depression, anxiety, etc., which can be addressed through targeted therapy.

- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" is mentioned as a component symptom category within a broader psychiatric condition (schizophrenia), suggesting a narrower and more incidental usage. In Text B, the term denotes a primary focus of psychological treatment, indicating its evolution into a broader, more defined category of mental health issues that can independently be the primary target of therapeutic interventions. This indicates a shift from a subordinate symptomatic mention to a principal therapeutic focus, reflecting a semantic expansion and increased specificity in clinical contexts over time."
6,Emotional disorders,"To examine the reliability and validity of the 66-item Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-Revised (SCARED-R), a questionnaire for measuring a broad range of DSM-defined anxiety disorder symptoms, in a sample of clinically referred youths.","Sleep apnea (SA) causes not only sleep disturbances, but also neurocognitive impairments and/or psychoemotional disorders. Here, we studied the effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on forebrain Fos expression using obese diabetic db/db mice to explore the pathophysiological alterations in neural activities and the brain regions related to SA syndrome. Male db/db mice were exposed to IH stimuli (repetitive 6-min cycles of 1min with 5% oxygen followed by 5min with 21% oxygen) for 8h (80 cycles) per day or normoxic condition (control group) for 14 days. Fos protein expression was immunohistochemically examined a day after the last IH exposure. Mapping analysis revealed a significant reduction of Fos expression by IH in limbic and paralimbic structures, including the cingulate and piriform cortices, the core part of the nucleus accumbens and most parts of the amygdala (i.e., the basolateral and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei, cortical amygdaloid area and medial amygdaloid nucleus). In the brain stem regions, Fos expression was region-specifically reduced in the ventral tegmental area while other regions including the striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus, were relatively resistant against IH. In addition, db/db mice exposed to IH showed a trend of sedative and/or depressive behavioral signs in the open field and forced swim tests. The present results illustrate that SA in the obese diabetic model causes neural suppression preferentially in the limbic and paralimbic regions, which may be related to the neuropsychological disturbances associated with SA. ","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" seems to be used specifically within the context of anxiety disorders, focusing primarily on anxiety symptoms and their assessment in a clinical population of youths. The text discusses a targeted screening and diagnostic procedure for anxiety-related symptoms. In contrast, Text B uses ""emotional disorders"" in a broader context relating to the effects of sleep apnea and intermittent hypoxia on neurocognitive impairments and psychoemotional disorders. The focus here extends beyond anxiety to include a range of emotional disruptions and their physiological and nehavioral correlations in an experimental study with diabetic mice. This shift in context from a narrow clinical diagnostic focus in Text A to a broader, more physiological and experimental perspective in Text B, including varied causes and manifestations such as depressive signs and neural suppression in emotional processing areas of the brain, suggests a significant semantic drift in the term ""emotional disorders."""
7,Emotional disorders,"There are no generally accepted classification schemes for motivational and emotional disorders. One of the reasons is the difficulty in isolating motivational and emotional disorders from complex behaviors. Therefore, terms which characterize certain behaviors globally, such as clinical syndromes, are preferred in the clinical literature. Another, related reason is that within clinical psychology and the psychology of emotions are treated as two entirely separate fields with hardly any mutual influence. A third reason lies in the diversities of theories and schools of thought where the psychology of emotions as well as clinical psychology are concerned, thus, schemes, based on a general framework which is grounded in research in ""Cognitiver Science"" and general psychology, were developed which enable the comprehensive classification of motivational and emotional disorders, irrespective of individual therapeutic schools of thought or emotion-theoretic orientations. From the classification schemes, diagnostic criteria can be derived. This is the topic of Part I. In Part II it is demonstrated how these schemas can be applied to the comparison of different therapeutic schools with respect to theories of motivational and emotional disorders. Moreover, it is shown, how these ideas can be used to derive strategies for therapeutic interventions.","Considerable previous research has shown that retrieval of overgeneral autobiographical memories (OGM) is elevated among individuals suffering from various emotional disorders and those with a history of trauma. Although previous theories suggest that OGM serves the function of regulating acute negative affect, it is also possible that OGM results from difficulties in keeping the instruction set for the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) in working memory, or what has been coined ""secondary goal neglect"" (Dalgleish, 2004). The present study tested whether OGM is associated with poor memory for the task's instruction set, and whether an instruction set reminder would improve memory specificity over repeated trials. Multilevel modelling data-analytic techniques demonstrated a significant relationship between poor recall of instruction set and probability of retrieving OGMs. Providing an instruction set reminder for the AMT relative to a control task's instruction set improved memory specificity immediately afterward.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""emotional disorders"" retains a consistent usage and meaning related to psychological conditions affecting emotional regulation or processing. Text A discusses the classification and therapeutic approaches regarding emotional disorders within the broader context of clinical psychology and emotional studies. It maintains a clinical and theoretical outlook on emotional disorders. Text B, while focusing on specific manifestations (overgeneral autobiographical memories in emotional disorders), still addresses these within the context of psychological disorders affecting emotional states, supporting a stable understanding and semantic consistency regarding the target word ""emotional disorders"" in clinical and psychological discourse. The focus remains on the impacts and theories surrounding conditions classified under emotional disorders, making the semantic usage unchanged between the two texts."
8,Emotional disorders,"To assess whether perceived parental care and protection varied according to age and gender of the child and whether they were associated with psychiatric diagnoses, these constructs were measured with the Parental Bonding Instrument in a cohort of non-referred adolescents (n = 762), in a clinically referred cohort (n = 1299), and in a group of adolescents from the referred cohort (n = 365) for whom DSM-III diagnoses were available. Significant differences in parental care and protection according to clinical status, age, gender and diagnosis were found. However, perceived parental affectionless control was not associated with emotional disorders in adolescents, contrary to reports in adult subjects, but with clinical status.","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been identified as a potential maintaining factor for generalised anxiety disorder; however, there is a growing evidence to suggest that IU may contribute to other anxiety and depressive disorders. Moreover, certain components of IU (namely prospective and inhibitory IU) have been shown to be differentially associated with symptoms of emotional disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which individuals with various anxiety and depressive disorders endorsed IU, firstly as a trait variable (with prospective and inhibitory components) and secondly in reference to regularly occurring, diagnostically relevant situations (situation-specific IU). The degree to which diagnosis predicted IU was examined in a highly comorbid clinical sample (N=218). Regardless of specific diagnoses, the degree of comorbidity emerged as a significant predictor of prospective IU and situation-specific IU. Conversely, specific diagnoses of social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder were uniquely related to inhibitory IU. These findings suggest that IU is a transdiagnostic construct and have implications for current diagnosis-specific and transdiagnostic theory and clinical practice.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The target word ""emotional disorders"" in both Text A and Text B refers to psychiatric conditions or diagnoses involving emotional issues. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are discussed in relation to adolescents' perceptions of parental behaviors and the linkage—or lack thereof—to psychiatric diagnoses. Conversely, Text B focuses on a psychological concept, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and its relationship to various emotional disorders like anxiety and depression.

Although the contexts and details surrounding the term differ—with Text A exploring family influences and Text B investigating a psychological factor as it relates to emotional disorders—the underlying meaning of the term ""emotional disorders"" remains fundamentally the same. It consistently refers to a category of mental health conditions characterized predominantly by problems with emotional regulation or expressions, including both mood and anxiety disorders. Therefore, the semantic drift of the term ""emotional disorders"" between the time periods of the texts is 'Unchanged.'"
9,Emotional disorders,"Presence or the sense of ""being there"" has been discussed in the literature as an essential, defining aspect of Virtual Reality (VR). The VR literature includes definitions rooted in behavioral response, signal detection theory, and philosophy, but has generally ignored the emotional aspects of experience. The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the concept of presence in terms of people's emotional engagement with reality and their environment. Emotions are an essential part of how people experience the world. Any theory of presence must take emotional factors into account. This thesis has implications about how research should be conducted to further our understanding of presence. Validated psychological techniques for assessing emotions by subjective report, behavioral observations, and facial analysis can all be applied to increase our understanding of virtual presence. Further understanding of the interaction between presence and emotional state will improve our understanding of the construct of presence as well as better inform us about how virtual environments can be applied in creating emotional effects or treating emotional disorders.","Preterm birth is associated with a high risk of residual neurodevelopmental disability and cognitive impairment. These problems are closely associated with psychiatric disorders and thus it is unsurprising that preterm birth also confers high risk for poor long term mental health. The risk associated with preterm birth is not a general one, but appears to be specific to symptoms and disorders associated with anxiety, inattention and social and communication problems, and manifest in a significantly higher prevalence of emotional disorders, ADHD and Autism. Adolescence is a key period for mental health and studies have shown that problems evident in childhood persist over this time and are more stable amongst preterm individuals than term-born peers. There is also modest evidence for an increased prevalence of psychotic symptoms in preterm adolescents. The high prevalence of psychiatric disorders, present in around 25% of preterm adolescents, requires long term screening and intervention.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the use of ""emotional disorders"" focuses on the interaction between emotional states and virtual environments, specifically how virtual reality can be used as a tool to create emotional effects or treat such disorders in an experimental or therapeutic context. The focus lies heavily on the emotional engagement of individuals with virtual environments and the theoretical framework surrounding user experience. In contrast, Text B presents ""emotional disorders"" in a clinical and developmental context, discussing the prevalence and risk of emotional disorders as psychiatric conditions associated with preterm birth, alongside concrete disorders like ADHD and Autism. The narrative shifts from theoretical and technological treatment applications to epidemiological and clinical discussions about the manifestation and management of emotional disorders due to organic or developmental issues. This indicates a significant shift in context and application from an experimental/therapeutic approach to a clinical/neurodevelopmental perspective."
10,Emotional disorders,"To calculate the prevalence of emotional disorders in primary care, using a screening test--the Yesavage--and the association of emotional disorders with other variables, with the aim of identifying the profile of an elderly person most likely to be depressed at some juncture of his/her life.","Individuals vulnerable to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are hypothesized to have ambivalence about their self-worth, morality and lovability [Guidano, V., & Liotti, G.

It also examined whether patients with OCD had higher levels of self-ambivalence compared to non-clinical controls and patients with other anxiety disorders. Participants were 73 OCD patients, 50 patients with another anxiety disorder, 225 non-clinical undergraduate students and 43 non-clinical community controls. They completed measures of self-ambivalence, OCD phenomena, OCD-relevant beliefs, depression, anxiety and self-esteem. Self-ambivalence was significantly associated with OCD phenomena and OCD-relevant beliefs, after controlling for self-esteem, depression and anxiety. Further, OCD participants were significantly more ambivalent than the non-clinical groups, but did not differ from anxious controls. It was argued that these results provide a basis for extending the cognitive-behavioural model of OCD to include ambivalent self-perceptions as a component of the cognitive mechanisms relevant to the disorder.","###Label:
Changed

###Reason:
In Text A, the use of the term ""emotional disorders"" broadly hinges on the domain of general mental health issues prevalent in primary care and is specifically linked to depressive states. The text uses a conventional approach, mentioning a screening test to identify common emotional disorders, with an emphasis on depression.

Text B, however, expands the scope of ""emotional disorders"" more deeply into the realm of psychiatric conditions like OCD, exploring complex dynamics such as self-ambivalence related to OCD and differentiating levels among various groups including those with other anxiety disorders. The focus here is not just on recognizing symptoms but understanding underlying cognitive-behavioral patterns.

This shift from a basic clinical evaluation of common emotional disorders primarily focused on a simple identification of depression to a more nuanced examination of specific disorders (OCD) and associated cognitive processes indicates a considerable semantic drift in terms of depth, specificity, and psychological understanding associated with the term."
11,Emotional disorders,"Individuals who work in law enforcement careers are often subjected to stress that can result in health and emotional disorders. Many police departments have begun to offer wellness programs to support their employees. This pilot study designed and implemented a nutrition education component for an existing police department wellness program. Twenty-eight subjects completed the 12-month study that included nutrition counseling, seminars on nutrition and eating behaviors, and monitoring of weight and blood lipid levels. There was a significant group trend for decreased weight and lower total cholesterol levels. Results of the study led to the development of health policy standards for the Austin (Tex) Police Department. Wellness programs that involve registered dietitians can result in weight loss and lower cholesterol levels for employees in high-stress occupations as well as changes in departmental policy.","Choices regarding coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak may imply the development as well as the severity of emotional disorders.

Text B focuses on emotional disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, assessing coping strategies and the relationship between these strategies and the severity of emotional disorders like depression, stress, and anxiety among students. Despite the different contexts and subjects, the term ""emotional disorders"" retains a similar meaning, referring to mental health conditions that can be influenced or exacerbated by external stress factors in both cases."

Eighty-two 8-year-old children and 56 11-year-old children were examined with regard to the following questions: 1. Do children who are diagnosed with anxiety disorder exhibit an atypical pattern of frontal brain activation? 2. Can this pattern be demonstrated in children of different ages? and 3. Are there gender differences in these patterns similar to those that have been demonstrated in adults? Baseline EEG activity was subjected to power spectral analysis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders reflected by high blood glucose levels and lack of hormone insulin.

- Reason: In both text excerpts, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to refer to psychological conditions that significantly influence emotions, attitudes, and behaviors. Text A discusses emotional disorders in the context of atypical EEG patterns and anxiety disorders in children, suggesting that these conditions can be identified through neurophysiological measures. Text B connects emotional disorders to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, indicating an association between physical health conditions and psychological stressors like depression and anxiety. Though the secondary focus (EEG patterns in children vs. association with diabetes in adults) varies, the underlying understanding and use of ""emotional disorders"" fundamentally remains the same—referring to affective disorders impacting mental health. Thereby, the term has not significantly drifted semantically between the two texts."

cardiovascular regulation. We highlight opportunities to improve quality of
life and reduce stress beyond the clinic environment and in healthy
individuals. This relatively unexplored area requires an understanding of how
we can personalise and automate music selection processes to fit individuals
needs and tasks via feedback loops mediated by measurements of
neuro-physiological responses.

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""emotional disorders"" maintains a consistent connotation and context associated with conditions or disturbances related to emotional health. 

- **Text A** discusses the increased risk and prevalence of emotional disorders among people with mental retardation, focusing on the psychological aspects, classifications, and need for studies within this demographic. The context clearly relates to psychological health issues.
- **Text B** talks about the use of music therapy as an intervention to improve patient outcomes in various disorders, including emotional disorders. Here, emotional disorders are implicitly linked with mood disturbances or mental health issues that can be addressed through therapeutic means, similar to Text A, though the approach (music therapy) and context (treatment and quality of life improvement) are different.

In both texts, ""emotional disorders"" refer essentially to disturbances in emotional or psychological well-being, indicating that the meaning of the term has not significantly drifted over the periods covered by the texts."
14,Emotional disorders,"The benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) is an intrinsic allosteric modulatory site of the GABAA-receptor-chloride channel complex of neuronal membranes mediating the main action of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The BZR is unique in recognizing three classes of ligands, two of them producing opposite modulatory effects on the GABAA receptor function in an allosteric fashion (agonists and inverse agonists) and the third acting as antagonists of the two others. Agonists and partial agonists of the BZR (belonging to various chemical classes) have therapeutic applications as broad-spectrum tranquilizers and specific anxiolytics- anticonvulsants, respectively. The BZR antagonist flumazenil, recently introduced in therapy, increases the versatility of agonists in therapy and greatly simplifies the treatment of agonist overdosing. Inverse agonists are interesting probes to analyse the biological basis of anxiety-related emotional disorders.",To examine demographic and clinical characteristics as potential predictors of change for children and youth with emotional disorders treated at two child and adolescent mental health outpatient services (CAMHS) in Norway.,"### Answer:
- Target word: Emotional disorders
- Text A: Here, ""emotional disorders"" is specifically associated with anxiety-related conditions, yet in a very technical context linking it to biological bases and pharmacological treatments. It discusses concepts like benzodiazepine receptor modulatory effects and their relation to managing emotional disturbances such as anxiety.
- Text B: The term ""emotional disorders"" encompasses a broader clinical scope involving various possible disturbances in children and youth, without specifics on the types or biological underpinnings as in Text A. The context focuses on mental health services and treatments in a more general and clinical-patient-focused framework.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: While ""emotional disorders"" in Text A is specifically tied to anxiety and pharmacological research, in Text B, it refers more generally to any range of emotional issues faced by children and youth engaging with mental health services. The shift from a narrow scientific context to a broader clinical application across various patient interactions suggests a semantic drift in focus from specific biochemical theories to wider clinical and therapeutic applications."
15,Emotional disorders,"The spectrum of plastic surgery in the head and neck area is wide. The indications for as well as potentials and limits too, aesthetic surgery cannot be pressed into a rigid framework. The operative strategy will substantively depend on several factors, including objectivated local findings from, as well as general situation and motivation, of the patient. In plastic surgery the psychological situation of the patient is very often paramount, especially as regards cosmetic aspects. Sometimes the declared motives of the patient hide emotional disorders. Several examples show the practicability and limits. The possibilities of corrective action depend not only on the local findings but also on the surgeon's experience and skill.","Aging is accompanied by various forms of immune dysfunction, leading to an increase in frequency of infections and the development of malignant tumors in mice and humans. Sirt1 has been implicated in processes as varied as metabolism, differentiation, cancer, and the stress response and aging. Senescence-accelerated mice prone 10 (SAMP10) show not only spontaneously occurring brain atrophy, with deficits in learning and memory, but also emotional disorders. We attempted in this study to clarify the deficits and found that the percentage of CD4/TNF-α T-cells in the spleen of 24-week-old (but not 6-week-old) SAMP10 to be significantly reduced. The thymus was significantly lighter, and the percentage of CD4⁺CD8⁺ cells was significantly lower in the 24-week-old SAMP10 than 6-week-old SAMP10. Microarray analyses indicated that genes related to transcription coactivator activity, growth factor activity, hormone activity, cytokine activity, receptor activity, and regulation of the immune system were downregulated in the thymus of 24-week-old SAMP10. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of KGF, Aire, and Sirt1 was decreased on the thymic epithelial cells (TECs) of 24-week-old SAMP10. However, these parameters improved after the mice were treated with intrabone marrow-bone marrow transplantation. This is the first report of age-related changes in immune system dysfunction in 24-week-old SAMP10 and the first to show that dysfunction on the TECs of 24-week-old SAMP10 was modulated by allogeneic bone marrow cells.","###Label: Changed

###Reason:
In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe underlying psychological conditions that may motivate patients to seek cosmetic plastic surgery. Here, the term appears in a context where the emotional disorders might not be openly acknowledged by the patient, suggesting a subtler, perhaps stigma-associated usage where these disorders are hidden motivations behind the desire for aesthetic changes.

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is linked specifically to biological and physiological studies in an aging mouse model. The discussion revolves around measurable, scientific observations such as immune system changes, brain atrophy, and the effects of aging on emotional disorders in a specific mouse model. This places ""emotional disorders"" within a biomolecular and scientific framework, examining them as diseases with potential biomedical interventions.

Overall, between the two texts, the semantic field of ""emotional disorders"" has shifted from primarily a psychological, somewhat stigmatized context focused on appearance and patient motivation (Text A) to a strictly scientific context where these disorders are symptoms observed in an animal model related to biological aging and immune function (Text B). This change in usage underscores a shift from a more personal and psychological interpretation to a biological and clinical perspective, indicating a significant semantic drift in the term ""emotional disorders."""
16,Emotional disorders,"With considerable overlapping and no little back tracking, the writer has attempted to discuss the psychotic, the neurotic and the victim of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Tolerance of overlapping is asked of the reader since it exists and defies our wish that these three miseries could be seen as separate entities. Yet they are sufficiently separate as to demand differing therapeutic approaches so it is necessary to give abbreviated attention to therapies. Attention is given to medical therapies while they are labeled secondary to psychotherapy. It is not mentioned but should be, that occasional exceptions seem to exist. The title and conclusion, first read in adolescence, seems to suggest that emotional disorders have been with us for quite a long while.","Test anxiety has a detrimental effect on test performance but current interventions for test anxiety have limited efficacy. Therefore, examination of newer psychological models of test anxiety is now required. Two transdiagnostic psychological models of emotional disorders that can account for anxiety are the intolerance of uncertainty model (IUM) and the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model. Intolerance of uncertainty, the stable disposition to find uncertainty distressing, is central to the IUM, while beliefs about thinking, metacognition, are central to the S-REF model. We tested for the first time the role of both intolerance of uncertainty and metacognitive beliefs in test anxiety.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: The term ""emotional disorders"" refers generally to psychological disturbances characterized by emotional dysfunction that impedes normal functioning across both texts. Text A discusses various types of emotional disorders such as psychotic disorders, neurotic disorders, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), emphasizing their distinction but overlapping clinical presentations, and discusses their treatment. Text B, while more specific and grounded in contemporary psychological models, still addresses emotional disorders within the context of test anxiety, applying models like the Intolerance of Uncertainty model (IUM) and the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model. Both texts deal with emotional disorders in terms of their impact on functioning and psychological well-being, suggesting that, despite the evolving understanding and approaches to these disorders, the fundamental core of what ""emotional disorders"" signify remains consistent between the periods. Each text integrates the term within a clinical and therapeutic discourse, thus preserving the semantic core of ""emotional disorders""."
17,Emotional disorders,"Emotional disorders may precede learning disabilities, follow learning disabilities, or occur at the same time. This paper discusses evidence supporting each of these hypotheses, focussing on the possibility that both learning disabilities and emotional disorders, or at least some subforms of them, may have a common origin in neurological dysfunction. A model of interaction of the many factors involved in both the development and the persistence across age for both learning disabilities and emotional disorders is presented and avenues of research are discussed. Data from a 15-year follow-up study which illustrate some of these complex relationships are presented.","The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C) is an intervention for children aged 7 to 13 targeting high negative emotion, emotional reactivity, and emotion regulation deficits common across emotional disorders. Our objective was to collect pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on the efficacy of the UP-C, comparing UP-C with an active, anxiety-focused intervention. Participants were 47 children with at least one primary anxiety disorder; approximately one half had elevated depression symptoms. Participants received either UP-C or the anxiety-focused control treatment. No condition-related differences were found with respect to diagnostic remission and anxiety symptoms. However, differences in favor of UP-C were observed with respect to treatment response at follow-up, depression symptoms, sadness dysregulation, and cognitive reappraisal. Results provide preliminary evidence that the UP-C may be at least as efficacious in treating anxiety as well-supported anxiety-specific treatment protocols and may produce greater gains in certain emotion reactivity and regulation variables.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is discussed in a broad, generic sense, primarily in relation to learning disabilities and neurological dysfunction. It encompasses various types of disorders without focusing on specific treatments or methodologies. Conversely, in Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is used within the specific context of a therapeutic intervention called the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment. Here, it directly addresses treatment methodologies, focusing on specific symptoms like high negative emotion, emotional reactivity, and emotion regulation deficits. This distinction suggests that the term has shifted towards a more clinical, treatment-centered approach over the years, indicating a semantic drift towards a more defined and specialized usage in psychological treatment contexts."
18,Emotional disorders,"Recent research has led to the evolution of an important clinical relationship among psychology, neurobiochemistry, and nutrition. The result has been the development of the multidisciplinary field of psychoneuro-nutritional medicine. The successful application of this medical model to mental health problems ranging from behavior disorders in children to cognitive/emotional disorders in adults has opened the door to new lower-technology, cost-effective approaches to improving functional neurobiochemistry. This review describes the psychoneuro-nutritional medicine model and its application to a variety of biobehaviorally related health problems.","Emotion regulation deficits are associated with various emotional disorders. Therefore, studies have attempted to improve emotion regulation ability to prevent psychopathological symptoms. Studies have revealed that working memory training-specifically attention control-can promote emotion regulation. In the present study, participants completed a running memory task in a 20-day training period. The participants' pre- and post-test data on attention network functions and late positive potential (LPP) were assessed and analyzed. Compared with the control group, the training group's orientation function improved markedly. In addition, LPP in relation to emotion regulation decreased during the 20-day training period. These results suggest that working memory training can improve emotion regulation ability, and the orientation function in the attention network may also contribute to this improvement.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe conditions affecting mental health which involve emotional disturbances or dysregulation. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are mentioned in the context of a broader discussion of multidisciplinary approaches to mental health, suggesting that these disorders encompass a range of issues related to emotional well-being that can be addressed through integrated medical approaches. In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" are specifically associated with emotion regulation deficits, highlighting a particular aspect of these disorders, but still within the realm of emotional disturbances in mental health. Thus, the core meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as conditions involving impaired emotional processes remains consistent between both texts, indicating no significant semantic drift."
19,Emotional disorders,"Education of children with learning, behavioral, or emotional disorders in the public schools has been rather remarkably transformed over the past decade by implementation of Public Law 94-142, Education of the Handicapped Act. Although children with learning disabilities have been served in far greater numbers than before, children with other disorders, including serious emotional disturbance, have either declined in numbers served or are being served in numbers far smaller than current prevalence rates would suggest are adequate. This paper reviews these trends, along with diagnostic criteria used to determine special education eligibility for such children, and discusses selected interdisciplinary and related trends.","This article presents the use of a transdiagnostic, emotion-focused treatment with a young woman with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The patient also presented with subclinical depressive, posttraumatic stress, and eating disorder symptoms. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (Barlow et al., 2011), a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to be applicable across anxiety, depressive, and related disorders with strong emotional components, was used to address the range of Laura's presenting concerns. After 16 individual treatment sessions, Laura experienced significant reductions in NSSI (and urges to engage in NSSI) as well as observable improvements in her self-reported ability to respond more adaptively to intense emotion. She also reported moderate reductions in her anxiety disorder symptoms. This case illustration demonstrates how a short-term, transdiagnostic treatment approach can be flexibly applied to a variety of problems maintained by aversive and avoidant reactions to intense emotion.","###Answer:
- **Target word:** Emotional disorders

- **Label:** Changed

- **Reason:**
  - **Text A (Past usage)**: In this context, ""emotional disorders"" appears primarily associated with serious emotional disturbances within educational settings, especially concerning public school children with special educational needs. The focus is on service provision, prevalence rates, and special education eligibility. The term is used broadly to cover various emotional disruptions, but more from an educational and social service perspective than clinical treatment.

  - **Text B (Recent usage)**: Here, ""emotional disorders"" is used within the clinical context of a transdiagnostic, emotion-focused treatment approach. The term encompasses a range of disorders including anxiety, depression, and related disorders that strongly feature emotional components. This usage illustrates a shift towards a more integrated, therapeutic perspective where emotional disorders are treated across a spectrum of interconnected symptoms rather than as isolated or purely educational issues.

  - The semantic drift occurs as the term transitions from a mostly educational and administrative context focusing on policy and service provision to a clinical context where it is aligned with therapeutic interventions aiming at a holistic treatment of interrelated emotional and psychological disorders. Thus, the term has expanded and become more clinically oriented in recent years."
20,Emotional disorders,"To determine the prevalence of medically unexplained rheumatic symptoms amongst patients newly referred to a rheumatology out-patient service and to examine their relationship with pain, disability, socioeconomic factors and the presence of emotional disorders (anxiety, depression and panic).","  In the online social dynamics, a robust scaling behaviour appears as a key
feature of many collaborative efforts that lead to the new social value. The
underlying empirical data thus offer a unique opportunity to study the origin
of self-organised criticality in social systems. In contrast to physical
systems in the laboratory, various human attributes of the actors play an
essential role in the process along with the contents (cognitive, emotional) of
the communicated artefacts. As a prototypal example, we consider the social
endeavour of knowledge creation via Questions\ \& Answers (Q\&A). Using a large
empirical dataset from one of such Q\&A sites and theoretical modelling, we
examine the temporal correlations at all scales and the role of cognitive
contents to the avalanches of the knowledge creation process. Our analysis
shows that the long-range correlations and the event clustering are primarily
determined by the universal social dynamics, providing the external driving of
the system by the arrival of new users. While the involved cognitive contents
(systematically annotated in the data and observed in the model) are crucial
for a fine structure of the developing knowledge networks, they only affect the
values of the scaling exponents and the geometry of large avalanches and shape
the multifractal spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the level of the activity
of the communities that share the knowledge correlates with the fluctuations of
the innovation rate, implying that the increase of innovation may serve as the
active principle of self-organisation. To identify relevant parameters and
unravel the role of the network evolution underlying the process in the social
system under consideration, we compare the social avalanches to the avalanche
sequences occurring in the field-driven physical model of disordered solids.
","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the target word ""emotional disorders"" clearly refers to psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, and panic that affect individuals. It's used in a clinical sense focusing on the relationship with physical symptoms in patients, aligning well with traditional understanding and diagnostic contexts of emotional disorders in medical and psychological fields. 

However, in Text B, the term is incorporated in a broader, more abstract exploration of social dynamics and human interactions within a knowledge-sharing platform. The mention of ""emotional"" appears to probe into the cognitive and emotional content of communications that contribute to social systems and their self-organising properties, rather than focusing on individual psychological health or disorders per se.

This difference in context from a direct medical or psychological focus to a broader and more metaphorical application in social interactions indicates a significant semantic drift in the use of ""emotional disorders"" from being a specifically medical term to being a concept applied to phenomena in social sciences and community dynamics."
21,Emotional disorders,"Various forms of collaboration between the disciplines of public health and psychiatry are briefly reviewed and the 25-year-old mental health program of the Vancouver Health Department is described. The public health nurse has prime responsibility in all children with emotional disorders. She is supported by a psychiatric team which provides active treatment and educational and consultative help for the nurse and the school. During the year 1963, six social workers had 2357 contacts with nurses and school personnel but only 1049 treatment interviews. Of 401 children referred to the psychiatric team, 138 received active clinic treatment, 141 remained under supervision by the public health nurse, and 122 were referred elsewhere. In addition, 1330 children were identified as ""mental hygiene cases"" in the caseload of the 170 public health nurses in the community. By close co-ordination, the public health nurse and the psychiatric team can enhance each other's contributions to community mental health.","This study aimed to examine cross-sectionally to what extent persons with higher symptom levels or a current or past emotional disorder report to be less happy than controls and to assess prospectively whether time-lagged measurements of extraversion and neuroticism predict future happiness independent of time-lagged measurements of emotional disorders or symptom severity. A sample of 2142 adults aged 18-65, consisting of healthy controls and persons with current or past emotional disorder according to DSM-IV criteria completed self-ratings for happiness and emotional well-being and symptom severity. Lagged measurements of personality, symptom severity and presence of anxiety and depressive disorder at T0 (year 0), T2 (year 2) and T4 (year 4) were used to predict happiness and emotional well-being at T6 (year 6) controlling for demographics. In particular persons with more depressive symptoms, major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder and comorbid emotional disorders reported lower levels of happiness and emotional well-being. Depression symptom severity and to a lesser extent depressive disorder predicted future happiness and emotional well-being at T6. Extraversion and to a lesser extent neuroticism also consistently forecasted future happiness and emotional well-being independent of concurrent lagged measurements of emotional disorders and symptoms. A study limitation is that we only measured happiness and emotional well-being at T6 and our measures were confined to hedonistic well-being and did not include psychological and social well-being. In sum, consistent with the two continua model of emotional well-being and mental illness, a 'happy' personality characterized by high extraversion and to a lesser extent low neuroticism forecasts future happiness and emotional well-being independent of concurrently measured emotional disorders or symptom severity levels. Boosting positive emotionality may be an important treatment goal for persons personally inclined to lower levels of happiness. ","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both texts A and B, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to mental health issues that affect mood, thinking, and behavior. In Text A from an earlier period, emotional disorders are described in the context of community mental health management, highlighting responsibilities among public health nurses and psychiatric teams in managing such conditions in children. Text B, from a more recent timeline, explores how emotional disorders affect personal happiness and emotional well-being, investigating the influence of personality traits and the severity of symptoms on the future happiness of individuals with these disorders.

Despite the different angles and specific details discussed in the two periods, the core meaning of ""emotional disorders"" remains stable across the texts. In both cases, the term is used to describe mental health conditions with significant emotional components, without a significant shift in connotation or implication. Thus, the way ""emotional disorders"" is understood and applied in medical and health-related contexts has not undergone notable semantic drift over the years despite advances in psychological research and changing focuses of studies."
22,Emotional disorders,"Cognitive biases in information processing play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of emotional disorders. A new methodology to measure attentional biases is presented; this approach encourages subjects to scan and re-scan images with different thematic content, while the pattern of their attentional deployment is continuously monitored by an eye-tracking system. Measures of attentional bias are the total fixation time and the average glance duration on images belonging to a particular theme. Results showed that subjects with depressive disorder (n=8; Beck Depression Inventory Score>/=16) spent significantly more time looking at images with dysphoric themes than subjects in the control group (n=9). Correlation analysis revealed that the differences between the fixation times of the two groups are significantly correlated with the valence ratings, but not with the arousal ratings of the images. The average glance duration on images with social, neutral and threatening themes were similar for both groups, while the average glance duration on images with dysphoric themes was significantly larger for subjects with depressive disorder. The above results suggest that subjects with depressive disorder selectively attend to mood-congruent material and that depression appears to influence the elaborative stages of processing when dysphoric images are viewed.","  In this paper the research draws upon reminiscence therapy, which is used in
treating dementia, as an applied theory to promote well being in people who

anticipated to improve mood in a group of users where severe emotional problems
are prevalent. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a
reminiscence based application in promoting well being in people specifically
with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The long term objective of this
research is to establish the effectiveness of reminiscence theory on user
groups aside from dementia, particularly other mental illnesses. The research

","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""emotional disorders"" retains a similar meaning related to conditions characterized by the disturbance of mood and affect, primarily in a psychological context. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" specifically refers to conditions being studied in a cognitive and psychological experimental framework, where attentional biases and depression are central themes. The context implies a focus on how emotional disorders affect cognitive processes and information processing. In Text B, while the approach differs slightly by referencing therapeutic interventions (reminiscence therapy) aimed at improving well-being in people with mood disorders and other emotional conditions like dementia and Borderline Personality Disorder, the underlying notion of ""emotional disorders"" as psychological conditions affecting mood and behavior remains consistent. Both texts, despite their different application settings, conceptualize emotional disorders as affecting psychological and emotional states, with a strong emphasis on mood-related impacts and psychological health. Thus, the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" remains substantially unchanged between the two texts, maintaining its root in psychological and emotional health disturbances."
23,Emotional disorders,"As a factor of recurrence of drinking in patients with alcoholic dependence, emotional disorders accompanied by alcohol dependence has been noted in many reports. Particularly, it is noted to be very likely that depression after abstinence is an incentive to re-start drinking. In this study, we investigated depressive feeling in aspects of psychiatric and physical subjective symptoms after abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence, and compared the symptoms with those in patients with involutional depression. On analysis of the major component of psychiatric subjective symptoms, a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness were observed. In involutional depression, depressive feeling, somnipathy, anxiety, self accusation/sense of guilt, delusion of culpability were observed. On analysis of the major component of physical subjective symptoms, autonomic nervous symptoms accompanied by feebleness, hysterical neurosis-like autonomic nervous symptoms, reduced sexual libido, anorexia, hydrodipsia/sweating were observed. Similarly, in patients with involutional depression, hysterical neurosis-like autonomic nervous symptoms, anorexia, elevation of tonus, general malaise, and hydrodipsia were noted. Differences in status were emphasized in comparison between the two groups in both analyses. Unlike involutional depression that exhibits the current features of depression, patients with alcohol dependence showed a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness, reflecting self-uncertainty and loss of self-respect. Drinking may be re-started to relieve or reduce tension and frustration in such conditions.","Interoception, the ability to feel the body's internal sensations, is an essential aspect of emotional experience. There is mounting evidence that interoception is impaired in common mental health disorders and that poor interoceptive awareness is a major contributor to emotional reactivity, calling for clinical interventions to address this deficit. The manuscript presents a comprehensive theoretical review, drawing on multidisciplinary findings to propose a metatheory of reinforcement mechanisms applicable across a wide range of disorders. We present a reconsideration of operant conditioning through the co-emergence model of reinforcement, which is a neurophenomenological account of the interaction between cognition and interoception, and its consequences on behavior. The model suggests that during memory processing, the retrieval of autobiographical memory (including maladaptive cognition) is dependent upon its co-emerging interoceptive cues occurring at the encoding, consolidation and reconsolidation stages. Accordingly, ""interoceptive reinforcement"" during emotional distress is a common factor to all emotional disorders and a major cause for relapse. We propose that interoceptive desensitization has transdiagnostic benefits, readily achievable through the cultivation of equanimity during mindfulness training and can be integrated in cognitive and behavioral interventions to permit a transdiagnostic applicability. We summarize the contributions of this approach into 10 specific and testable propositions.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is closely linked to specific behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with alcohol dependence, focusing primarily on clinical observations such as a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness, especially in relation to substance abuse. The context shows a direct correlation between emotional disorders and alcohol consumption, illustrating emotional disorders as immediate psychological reactions influencing and influenced by substance dependence. On the other hand, Text B expands the understanding of ""emotional disorders"" to a deeper, more systemic level involving physiological processes like interoception and its impact on mental health across a broader spectrum. The text discusses how interoceptive awareness (or its lack) contributes fundamentally to emotional disorders, implicating a broader scope of mental health conditions beyond substance-related issues. There's a theoretical and mechanistic exploration of how emotional disorders arise and persist, suggesting approaches for clinical intervention that are based on neurophenomenological accounts of cognition and bodily awareness. The shift from a symptom-focused view in the earlier text to a systemic, mechanism-focused understanding in the later text indicates a significant semantic drift in the conceptualization of ""emotional disorders."""
24,Emotional disorders,"Primary care physicians and nurse practitioners are the initial casefinders of mental health problems and major providers of mental health treatment in the United States. However, past studies suggest that such primary care providers often neither recognize nor correctly diagnose their patients' mental disorders. This study compared an HMO's primary providers' direct assessments of the current emotional disorders of patients just seen for an outpatient medical visit with those of mental health professionals assessing the same patients with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM III R (SCID). Using the SCID-derived diagnosis as the standard, the primary providers failed to recognize almost two-thirds of their patients with a current mental disorder. Although confident in their assessments, the primary providers were also able to correctly identify very few of the specific mental disorders most prevalent in primary medical care practice; they identified only one of the seven depressions, three of the 18 anxiety disorders, and none of the four alcohol or drug abuse disorders. Reasons for these diagnostic discrepancies, comparisons with past studies, and training to improve primary providers' diagnosis of mental disorders in their patients are discussed.","Multiple psychological treatments for emotional disorders have been developed and implemented, improving the quality of life of individuals. Nevertheless, relapse and poor response to psychotherapy are common. This article argues that a greater understanding of both the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of change in psychotherapy is essential to improve treatment for emotional disorders. It aims to demonstrate how an understanding of these mechanisms provides a basis for (i) reconceptualizing some mental disorders, (ii) refining and establishing the evidence for existing therapeutic techniques and (iii) designing new techniques that precisely target the processes that maintain these disorders. Possible future directions for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuropsychology and clinical psychology are discussed.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used predominantly in a clinical diagnosis context, focusing on the challenges primary care providers face in recognizing and diagnosing these disorders accurately. The emphasis is on the identification and misdiagnosis of these conditions within a medical setting, suggesting a purely clinical and somewhat narrow perspective where emotional disorders are seen as conditions to be identified and managed.

In Text B, the use of ""emotional disorders"" shifts towards a more holistic and integrative perspective. It discusses not just the identification and treatment but the underlying psychological and neurobiological mechanisms, aiming to improve outcomes through a deeper understanding of how therapy affects the brain and psychological processes. This suggests a broader, more complex view of emotional disorders that encompasses both the clinical symptoms and the multifaceted approaches to treatment, including emerging techniques and the integration of neuropsychological insights.

This shift from a focus on clinical diagnosis and treatment failures to an emphasis on advanced understanding and treatment approaches indicates a significant semantic drift in the term ""emotional disorders,"" reflecting broader changes in the mental health field’s approach to these issues."
25,Emotional disorders,"The association between eating disorders, substance use, and emotional distress is well recognized in the literature. To determine whether dancers who are known to be at risk for eating disorders were also at risk for other emotional disorders, the co-occurrence of eating disorders, substance use, and emotional distress among dancers (N = 50) and nondancers (N = 56) was examined. These young adult women were part of a longitudinal study of the complications of decreased bone density. Participants filled out questionnaires about eating behavior, substance use, and emotional functioning. A clinical interview determined the existence of eating disorders (DSM-III-R). Physiological data, including an assessment of current health, also were collected. There were no differences in disordered eating between the two subject groups. Associations existed within each group, however. Many associations including substance use and emotional distress were found among the nondancers, while no associations were found among the dancers. Thus, eating disorders in a group of subjects at risk because of professional pressures to remain thin revealed a profile which differed significantly from that of women developing eating disorders in the general population.",To identify cognitive and emotional disorders and their correlation with neuroimaging parameters in patients with chronic migraine.,"- Label: Unchanged

In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" is linked with emotional distress and is explored in the context of co-occurring conditions (eating disorders and substance use), illustrating a complex interaction that affects psychological health. Text B focuses more on identifying emotional disorders specifically in patients with chronic migraine, linking psychological evaluations with neuroimaging to understand the interplay between physical and emotional health conditions. In both instances, the term retains the core meaning related to psychological or psychiatric conditions impacting emotions, thus indicating that the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" remains consistent between the two textual contexts over time."
26,Emotional disorders,"Over a period of four years, 316 emotionally disordered patients were inspected for the frequency of seasonally conditioned hospitalisation, considering however solely the most recent prior hospitalisation within the four-year period. A cautious interpretation of the results would suggest significant differences in the seasonal frequency of emotional disorders that have resulted in hospitalisation. Manic depressive disorders, endogenous depression, and involutional depressions treated in hospital occur with the greatest frequency in autumn. These results suggest the possibility of employing thymoleptic treatment, notably to effect an influence on biorhythms, for instance, lithium, deprivation of sleep, and bright-light therapy.","An important concern in Internet-based treatments (IBTs) for emotional disorders is the high dropout rate from these protocols. Although dropout rates are usually reported in research studies, very few studies qualitatively explore the experiences of patients who drop out of IBTs. Examining the experiences of these clients may help to find ways to tackle this problem.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The term ""emotional disorders"" in both Text A and Text B refers to conditions that significantly affect an individual's emotional state and capacity, necessary for daily functioning. Text A discusses emotional disorders primarily in a clinical context, identifying specific types of disorders such as manic depressive and depressive states, and discussing treatment approaches. Text B, although focusing on the dropout rates of patients undergoing internet-based treatments for emotional disorders, still centers on the broader issue of managing and understanding these conditions. In both texts, despite the difference in focus (treatment efficacy versus treatment adherence), the underlying concept of ""emotional disorders"" remains consistent, referring to mental health conditions with significant emotional components. This indicates that the semantic meaning of ""emotional disorders"" has remained largely stable over the periods compared, continuing to encompass a range of psychological conditions affecting emotion regulation and expression."

Older construction workers were 1.4 times more likely to have a back problem and 1.3 times more likely to have a foot or leg problem than were other blue-collar workers. Nonsmoking older construction workers were 3.2 times more likely to have chronic lung disease than their nonsmoking blue-collar counterparts. When accounting for alcohol consumption, older construction workers were 1.7 times more likely to have been diagnosed with an emotional problem than other older blue-collar workers. The high rate of chronic lung disease is most likely related to on-the-job dust exposure, while the increased risk of emotional disorders might be due to the dynamics of the construction labor market.","This article describes the workshop ""Teaching Child Psychiatric Assessment Skills: Using Mental Health Screening Instruments,"" presented at the 35th Forum for Behavioral Sciences in Family Medicine on 20 September 2014. The goals of the presentation were (1) to teach family medicine behavioral health educators to use both general and problem-specific mental health screening tools (MHSTs) in their work with trainees to help satisfy the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandate for behavioral and mental health experience during family medicine residency, (2) to reflect on how MHSTs might be integrated into the flow of family medicine teaching practices, and (3) to exemplify how evidence-based methods of adult education might be used in teaching such content. One general MHST, the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 and one problem-specific MHST for each of the four commonest pediatric mental health issues: for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the Vanderbilt; for Anxiety, the Screen for Childhood Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders; for Depression, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for teens; and for Aggression, the Retrospective-Modified Overt Aggression Scale, were practiced at least twice in the context of a clinical vignette. All of the selected MHSTs are free in the public domain and available for download from the website: www.CAPPCNY.org. Participants were asked to reflect on their own office practice characteristics and consider how MHSTs might be integrated into their systems of care. This workshop could be replicated by others wishing to teach the use of MHSTs in primary care settings or teaching programs. ","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used more broadly to describe various psychiatric or mental issues potentially affecting older construction workers, implying a general category of conditions. Here, ""emotional disorders"" is linked to occupational stresses and physical health conditions, indicating a non-specific, generalized usage typical of conversations about mental health affecting a specific demographic.

In Text B, the usage of ""emotional disorders"" appears within a specifically educational and clinical context, discussing mental health screening tools (MHSTs) for diagnosing and teaching about psychiatric conditions in a medical education setup. This context situates ""emotional disorders"" alongside clarified, specialized, and distinctly categorized child and adolescent psychiatric issues like anxiety, depression, and ADHD. The mention of specific screening tools for each disorder underscores a shift towards a more structured, systematic, and perhaps medicalized view of ""emotional disorders.""

Thus, there's a notable drift from a general, somewhat colloquial use in an occupational health context (Text A) to a specific, clinically and educationally oriented use within detailed psychiatric assessment and teaching frameworks (Text B)."
28,Emotional disorders,"The impact and course of additional diagnoses was examined in 126 patients undergoing cognitive-behavioral treatment for panic disorder. With the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule--Revised, a high comorbidity rate (51%) was observed at pretreatment. Pretreatment comorbidity was not predictive of premature termination, nor did it have a substantial impact on short-term treatment outcome. However, patients with comorbidity at posttreatment were more likely to have sought additional treatment over the follow-up interval. Although a significant and dramatic decline in the overall comorbidity rate was found at posttreatment (17%), at 24-month follow-up this rate had increased to a level (30.2%) that was no longer significantly different from pretreatment. This was despite the fact that patients maintained or improved on treatment gains for panic disorder over this interval. The implications of these findings for the treatment, conceptualization, and classification of emotional disorders are discussed.","Stressful stimuli can exacerbate persistent pain disorder. However, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Here, to reveal the underlying mechanism for stressful stimuli-induced hyperalgesia in chronic pain, we investigated the effect of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activation on pain hypersensitivity using single-prolonged stress (SPS) model, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model and SPS + CFA model. The experimental results revealed significantly reduced paw withdrawal threshold in the SPS, CFA, and SPS + CFA group compared with the control group. However, the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was observed in the SPS- or SPS + CFA-exposed group but not the CFA group compared with control group. There was also a significant increase in mPFC ERK1/2 phosphorylation and mechanical allodynia after SPS + CFA treatment compared to SPS or CFA treatment alone. Furthermore, inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation by microinjection of U0126, a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, into the mPFC attenuated SPS + CFA- and SPS- but not CFA-induced mechanical allodynia, anxiety-like behavior, and cognitive impairments. These results suggest that the activation of ERK1/2 in the mPFC may contribute to the process of stress-induced cognitive and emotional disorders, leading to an increase in pain sensitivity.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In the context of both texts, the term ""emotional disorders"" seems to be applied within the framework of psychological and physiological studies. However, there is a significant drift in the application and understanding of the underlying factors and their recognition in relation to other health dimensions over time. In Text A from an earlier period, ""emotional disorders"" are discussed mainly in a narrow clinical and cognitive-behavioral framework with a primary focus on treatment and outcomes of patients with panic disorder, considering the comorbidity rates over time. Whereas, in Text B from a more recent context, the term spans a broader interdisciplinary understanding that includes mechanisms at the molecular level (e.g., ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and its interaction with physical states like chronic pain and stress, alongside cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behavior, thus showing a more integrated bio-psycho-social perspective. This expansion in understanding and relating ""emotional disorders"" with various biological and psychological processes suggests a semantic drift towards a more complex and inclusive interpretation of the term."
29,Emotional disorders,"Thirty patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia and 30 normal controls were compared on explicit memory (cued recall) and implicit memory (word stem completion) for positive, neutral, social threat, and physical threat words. The panic patients showed an explicit memory bias, but no implicit memory bias, for physical threat words. The index of explicit memory bias for physical threat words was found to correlate with anxiety sensitivity and degree of agoraphobic fear and avoidance. The index of baseline bias for threat words on the word completion task, on the other hand, correlated with trait anxiety. Although there were no correlations between explicit and implicit memory bias for physical threat words, explicit memory bias for physical threat words correlated with explicit memory bias indexes for positive words and social threat words. The results are discussed in terms of the functional role of an explicit memory bias for physically threatening events in panic disorder. The negative results on implicit memory bias are discussed in relation to earlier studies, the use of different implicit memory tasks, and the role of baseline bias on implicit memory tasks. Finally, the hypothesis is suggested that explicit and implicit memory bias for emotional information may represent two different styles of information processing, which serve as vulnerability factors for different emotional disorders.","Despite being an intensive area of research, the function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) remains somewhat of a mystery. Human imaging studies implicate the ACC in various cognitive functions, yet surgical ACC lesions used to treat emotional disorders have minimal lasting effects on cognition. An alternative view is that ACC regulates autonomic states, consistent with its interconnectivity with autonomic control regions and that stimulation evokes changes in autonomic/emotional states. At the cellular level, ACC neurons are highly multi-modal and promiscuous, and can represent a staggering array of task events. These neurons nevertheless combine to produce highly event-specific ensemble patterns that likely alter activity in downstream regions controlling emotional and autonomic tone. Since neuromodulators regulate the strength of the ensemble activity patterns, they would regulate the impact these patterns have on downstream targets. Through these mechanisms, the ACC may determine how strongly to react to the very events its ensembles represent. Pathologies arise when specific event-related representations gain excessive control over autonomic/emotional states.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
The target word ""emotional disorders"" has been used in both texts to refer specifically to psychiatric conditions characterized by emotional dysregulation or abnormal emotional responses that impact daily functioning. 

- In Text A, the usage of ""emotional disorders"" aligns with the study of explicit and implicit memory biases in patients with panic disorder (a type of emotional disorder), discussing how these biases correlate with symptoms and may represent information processing styles that contribute to the vulnerability for such disorders.

- Text B discusses the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in regulating autonomic/emotional states and how its dysfunction can lead to emotional disorders. It explores the potential biological mechanisms within the brain that can contribute to the manifestations of emotional disorders through altered neural patterns and autonomic control.

In both texts, despite discussing different aspects (memory biases vs. neural mechanisms), the term ""emotional disorders"" maintains a consistent meaning related to conditions affecting emotional processing and regulation. The contexts in both periods (the psychological and neurobiological dimensions considered) are aligned under the broad category of emotional disorders without a shift in the understanding or application of the term.

30,Emotional disorders,"The reliability of current and lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) anxiety and mood disorders was examined in 362 outpatients who underwent 2 independent administrations of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Lifetime version (ADIS-IV-L). Good to excellent reliability was obtained for the majority of DSM-IV categories. For many disorders, a common source of unreliability was disagreements on whether constituent symptoms were sufficient in number, severity, or duration to meet. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. These analyses also highlighted potential boundary problems for some disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder). Analyses of ADIS-IV-L clinical ratings (0-8 scales) indicated favorable interrater agreement for the dimensional features of DSM-IV anxiety and mood disorders. The findings are discussed in regard to their implications for the classification of emotional disorders.","The brain has the ability to sense, coordinate, and respond to environmental changes through biological processes involving activity-dependent gene expression. cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs) have recently emerged as novel transcriptional regulators of essential biological functions, while their deregulation is linked to age-related human diseases. In the brain, CRTCs are unique signaling factors that act as sensors and integrators of hormonal, metabolic, and neural signals contributing to brain plasticity and brain-body communication. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms and functions of CRTCs in brain metabolism, lifespan, circadian rhythm, and synaptic mechanisms underlying memory and emotion. We also discuss how CRTCs deregulation in cognitive and emotional disorders may provide the basis for potential clinical and therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The target word ""Emotional disorders"" is used similarly in both Text A and Text B, maintaining its fundamental meaning across time. In Text A from an earlier period, ""emotional disorders"" refers to various conditions classified primarily within the anxiety and mood disorder spectrum as defined in DSM-IV. The text discusses the reliability of these diagnostic categories and focuses on clinical assessments concerning emotional disorders.

In Text B from a more recent period, ""emotional disorders"" still pertains to psychological conditions related to mood and cognition. Here, these conditions are associated with deregulation of CRTCs, which are linked to broader aspects of brain function and disease, including those affecting emotion.

While Text B expands the discussion of emotional disorders by linking them to biochemical and genetic factors and incorporating modern scientific findings, the fundamental concept remains the same: they are disturbances in emotional regulation and expression, leading to cognitive and mood-related issues. Thus, the term ""emotional disorders"" has not undergone significant semantic drift and retains its core meaning related to psychological conditions affecting mood and emotion."

","Cutaneous pseudolymphoma (C-PSL) is defined as reactive polyclonal benign lymphoproliferative process predominantly composed of either B-cells or T-cells, localized or disseminated. It heals spontaneously after cessation of the causative factor (e.g. drugs) or after non-aggressive treatment. The author herein presents a case of C-PSL with an immunohistochemical study. A 78-year-old man consulted our hospital because of slightly itching skin swelling on the arm. He denied insect bite and traumatic injury. His usual intake drugs were drugs of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and emotional disorders. Physical examination showed mildly erosive swelling of the am. The lesion measured 1 x 1 x 0.2 cm. Biopsy of the lesion was taken, and it revealed excessive proliferation of small lymphoid cells. The lymphoid cells lacked apparent atypical features and appeared matures. Lymphoblastic cells with nucleoli were scattered. Nodular structures were also seen in the lower dermis. Immunohistochemically, the lymphoid cells were positive for vimentin, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD23, CD30, CD43, CD38, CD138, CD45RO, CD79α, bcl-2, bcl-6, κ-chain, λ-chain, and Ki-67 (labeling index=7%). No light chain restriction is seen. The lymphoblastic cells were positively labeled for CD15 and CD30. Plasma cells positive for CD38, CK79α and CD138 were seen in a significant amounts. They were negative for cytokeratin (CK) CAM5.2, CKAE1/3, CK34BE12, CK5/6, CK7, CK8, CK18, CK19, CK20, EMA, CEA, CD56, CD57, p53, KIT, PDGFRA, and cyclin D1. Because the constituent cells were both B-cells including plasm cells and T-cells, no light-chain restriction was seen, and no histological atypia was seen, a diagnosis of cutaneous pseudolymphoma was made. The low Ki-67 labeling and negative p53 also suggested the diagnosis. The lesion slightly reduced in size (from 1 cm to 0.7 cm), the causative agent was still unknown 11 months after the biopsy.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is associated with the broader neurological and psychological context, examining how emotions interact with other cognitive processes such as sensations and reflections. This encompasses a comprehensive, possibly holistic view of emotional disorders within the brain's activity. In contrast, Text B mentions ""emotional disorders"" in a medical setting, listing it among other chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes, implying that it is considered more as a clinical, treatable condition alongside other physical health issues. This shift suggests that the term ""emotional disorders"" has broadened and perhaps normalized in medical contexts over time, focusing more on its management alongside physical ailments rather than primarily its neurological and psychological aspects."
32,Emotional disorders,"A consecutive series of school age children (7 to 16 years) with emotional disorders (N = 100) were compared with a series of community controls (N = 100) matched for age, sex and social class for the quality of their friendships. A semi-structured interview was developed to measure the quality of friendship for this purpose. Significantly more (48%) children with emotional disorder were likely to be rated as experiencing moderate to poor friendships in the 12 months prior to the onset of symptoms than were controls (16%) in the 12 months prior to interview. Prepubertal children with moderate to poor friendship patterns were classified as either predominantly anxious or depressed. Postpubertal children with moderate to poor friendships patterns were, in contrast, predominantly anxious. These findings suggest that puberty denotes a point of change for the impact of friendship deficits on the psychopathology of emotional disorder. There were no sex differences in the clinical classification of children with moderate or poor friendship patterns.","Maternal separation (MS), an early life stressful event, has been demonstrated to trigger neuropsychiatric disorders later in life, in particular depression. Experiments using rodents subjected to MS protocols have been very informative for the establishment of this association. However, the mechanism by which MS leads to neuropsychiatric disorders is far from being understood. This is probably associated with the multifactorial nature of depression but also with the fact that different research MS protocols have been used (that vary on temporal windows and time of exposure to MS). In the present study, MS was induced in rats in two developmental periods: for 6 h per day for 14 days between postnatal days 2-15 (MS2-15) and 7-20 (MS7-20). These two periods were defined to differ essentially on the almost complete (MS2-15) or partial (MS7-20) overlap with the stress hypo-responsive period. Behavioral, immunological, and endocrine parameters, frequently associated with depressive-like behavior, were analyzed in adulthood. Irrespectively from the temporal window, both MS exposure periods led to increased sera corticosterone levels. However, only MS2-15 animals displayed depressive and anxious-like behaviors. Moreover, MS2-15 was also the only group presenting alterations in the immune system, displaying decreased percentage of CD8(+) T cells, increased spleen T cell CD4/CD8 ratio, and thymocytes with increased resistance to dexamethasone-induced cell death. A linear regression model performed to predict depressive-like behavior showed that both corticosterone levels and T cell CD4/CD8 ratio explained 37% of the variance observed in depressive-like behavior. Overall, these findings highlight the existence of ""critical periods"" for early life stressful events to exert programing effects on both central and peripheral systems, which are of relevance for distinct patterns of susceptibility to emotional disorders later in life. ","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is primarily associated with the psychological and social aspects of children, highlighting issues like anxiety and depression in relation to their social interactions and the quality of their friendships. The focus is on the impact of social relationships on the psychological well-being of the children.

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is expanded to include a broader biological perspective, discussing the roles of early life stress (Maternal Separation), immunological changes, and hormonal alterations (corticosterone levels) alongside behavioral outcomes like depression and anxiety in a preclinical (rodent) model. This text integrates physiological, immunological, and endocrine factors that potentially contribute to or result from emotional disorders, which illustrates a shift towards a more holistic understanding of emotional disorders encompassing biological, physiological, and neurobiological elements in addition to psychological aspects.

This change in usage demonstrates a semantic drift where ""emotional disorders"" has evolved from a mainly psychological and social framework to include significant biological and neuroscientific dimensions that are considered in studying and addressing these disorders."
33,Emotional disorders,"In a retrospective design, 20 children and adolescents with psychoses of late onset and hallucinations were compared with 20 children with conduct or emotional disorders who also had hallucinations. Marked differences emerged between the two groups. Psychotic subjects showed significantly more delusions, abnormalities in language production, inappropriate affect, bizarre behaviour, hypoactivity, and social withdrawal. Some subjects had symptoms which indicated a specially profound breakdown in personality functioning, but schneiderian and other schizophrenic symptoms were relatively rare. This questions their diagnostic value in the psychoses of late onset of children and adolescents.","Significant changes in the economic, familial and social support aspects in India have occurred in recent times, making it an interesting naturalistic setting to observe the effects of a dynamic socioeconomic environment on behavioral and emotional disorders in adolescents.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The target word ""emotional disorders"" in both Text A and Text B refers to psychological conditions affecting emotions and behavior. In Text A, emotional disorders are discussed in the context of children and adolescents who exhibit various psychological symptoms like inappropriate affect and social withdrawal alongside hallucinations. In Text B, the term is used to discuss how changes in socioeconomic environments impact behavioral and emotional disorders in adolescents, suggesting a focus on how external factors influence these psychological conditions. In both texts, the essential meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as psychological or mental health conditions affecting emotions remains consistent, without any significant shift in definition or context that would indicate a semantic drift."
34,Emotional disorders,"Psychosomatic dermatology is practiced in some manner by every dermatologist. In spite of this, there has been a virtual void in the literature from the middle 1950s until the present time. The relationship to physiologic phenomena, as well as a classification of psychosomatic dermatology, is reviewed. Dermatologic patients are divided into three groups: the primary group in which the emotional disorder is the primary disease and the cutaneous disorder merely part of its expression; the secondary group in which the basic cause is organic but does not affect the person emotionally in various degrees; and the collaborative group in which the organic causes and emotional disorders combine in different degrees to cause the skin disorder. This paper discusses anxiety and depression along with methods of dermatologic psychosomatic therapy consisting of antianxiety drugs, especially the benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnosis, behavior therapy, and the doctor/patient rapport. We conclude that one of the objectives for every dermatologist is to treat the entire patient-the psyche along with the soma.","The cognitive behavioral interventions based on the transdiagnostic approach for emotional disorders have received useful empirical supports in recent years. Most of the researches on this area have been conducted without any control group. Moreover, little information about comparative effectiveness has reported. The current study was compared transdiagnostic group therapy with classical cognitive group therapy.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" primarily focuses on the psychological impact of these disorders on dermatological conditions, highlighting how emotional states (like anxiety and depression) trigger or exacerbate skin issues. The usage here implies a direct impact on physical health manifesting through the skin. In contrast, Text B discusses ""emotional disorders"" within the context of psychological treatment through cognitive-behavioral interventions that aim at addressing a broader spectrum of psychological conditions using a transdiagnostic approach. This usage focuses on therapeutic techniques rather than physical manifestations, indicating an expanded perspective on the treatment and understanding of psychological problems rather than their dermatological expressions. The semantic drift reflects a shift from a more symptom-driven, manifestation-focused view to a broader, treatment-focused approach in dealing with these disorders across various psychological conditions."
35,Emotional disorders,"A prospective study of 48 patients with pituitary adenomas, 19 adenomas causing Cushing's disease, 18 adenomas causing acromegaly, and 11 clinically hormone-inactive adenomas (inactive adenomas), was performed to study emotional disorders occurring before and after transsphenoidal microsurgery. Factors which led to an obvious delay in the diagnostic process were identified. - The tools utilised were an interview and repeated personality assessments. The personality assessments were begun preoperatively and continued for about half a year postoperatively. The interview data, including retrospective statements regarding somatic difficulties, was analysed. - The thesis of a uniform psychopathology due to the influence of elevated hormone levels, and a lack in patients' sensitivity towards their changed appearance in acromegaly could not be confirmed. A high variability of reported emotional problems was found. The most common psychopathological signs for Cushing's disease were excitability and depression, for acromegaly fatigue/loss of energy was the most frequent complaint. Six to eight months postoperatively, a majority of patients noticed an increase of physical well-being. In acromegaly, the time span between first consultation and diagnosis averaged 6.2 years, in Cushing's disease it was 4.3 years, and in inactive adenomas it was 3.9 years. Only a small part of the delay in diagnosis, less than two years, could be attributed to the patients' hesitation to consult a physician.","The global emergency produced by COVID-19 has been a turning point for health organizations.

36,Emotional disorders,"Health maintenance organizations serve an estimated 20 percent of the child population, approximately 12 million children, many of whom have chronic conditions or disabling conditions. These children consume a disproportionate share of health resources and represent an important challenge in terms of care management. As HMOs increasingly enroll children with private insurance and Medicaid who have various physical, developmental, behavioral, and emotional disorders, they must find new and innovative ways to provide their care. Almost one third of children are affected by chronic conditions, and a smaller percentage (6 percent) suffer from chronic disabling conditions. Seven design elements for enhancing preventive and primary care for children with chronic conditions are presented in this article with illustrative examples from HMOs and state Medicaid programs.","Many pediatricians use a broad developmental screening test as part of well-child care, but do not specifically screen for behavioral and emotional disorders. Parents at 2 urban community agencies completed both the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional (ASQ:SE) for 608 children, ages 2 to 60 months; 51.8% in Spanish. Less than half of the children with a positive screen on the ASQ:SE would have been identified as needing additional assessment or intervention if only the ASQ-3 had been administered. Younger children with positive ASQ:SE screens were significantly less likely to be referred for mental health services compared with older children. Physicians should consider screening all young children for social-emotional and behavioral needs, and referring those identified for infant and early childhood mental health services.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe psychological or developmental issues that affect emotions, impacting behavior and overall health. The context in both passages deals with the management and identification of these disorders in children. Text A discusses the need for health organizations to provide care for children with various disorders including emotional ones as part of their services. Text B implements this idea further by discussing how pediatricians use screenings to identify children with possible emotional or behavioral issues for necessary interventions. Despite the temporal and contextual differences, the core meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as a classification of mental health conditions remains consistent."
37,Emotional disorders,"In a previous study on Evaluative Conditioning it was found that unlike signal-learning, evaluative learning is resistant to extinction. In the present experiment we tried to replicate and corroborate this finding. In addition, we investigated the effectiveness of a counterconditioning procedure to alter acquired evaluative value. On a within-subject base (n = 30), it was found that the mere contingent presentation of neutral with (dis)liked pictures of human faces was sufficient to change the affective-evaluative tone of the originally neutral stimuli in (negative) positive direction. Next, we replicated the finding that an extinction procedure does not have any influence on the acquired evaluative value of the originally neutral stimuli, and this even in subjects fully aware of the extinction presentations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of a counterconditioning procedure to alter acquired evaluative value, and in addition, found some evidence that awareness of the counterconditioning manipulations is not a prerequisite for its effectiveness. The theoretical consequences of these findings are phrased in terms of a fundamental distinction between signal-learning and evaluative learning, and some important implications for the behavioral treatment of affective-emotional disorders are suggested.","Family accommodation describes ways in which parents modify their behavior to help a child avoid or alleviate distress caused by emotional disorders. Accommodation is associated with increased symptom severity, lower functioning, and poorer treatment outcomes. Accommodation is prevalent in childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders (ADs) but no studies have compared accommodation in these groups or compared them to healthy controls to ascertain if accommodation is prevalent in the general population. This study addresses these gaps by comparing patterns of accommodation, factors that maintain accommodation, and its relation to symptom severity in OCD and AD, relative to healthy controls.","### Label: Changed

### Reason:
The target word ""emotional disorders"" exhibits a semantic drift in its context and implications between the two texts. 

In Text A, the mention of ""emotional disorders"" appears in the context of evaluative conditioning, emphasizing how learning techniques affect the perception and response to stimuli in a psychological-experimental setting. Here, it's closely associated with the concepts of learning and behavioral treatment, focusing more on a controlled experimental manipulation of emotions and evaluative processes.

In contrast, Text B discusses ""emotional disorders"" within a more clinical and familial context, specifically referring to the behaviors in a familial environment that either exacerbate or ameliorate the symptoms of these disorders. The focus is significantly on the dynamics within families, like accommodation behaviors in response to disorders like OCD and anxiety, impacting everyday living and interactions profoundly.

This shift from an experimental-psychological perspective to a clinical-real-world impact along with family dynamics over the course of two decades signifies a broadening of how ""emotional disorders"" are understood and approached in diverse settings, thus marking a significant semantic drift from purely experimental discussions to practical implications and treatments within family systems. This change reflects a deeper societal understanding and a more holistic approach to considering emotional disorders not just as isolated psychological phenomena but as conditions deeply entwined with social and familial contexts."
38,Emotional disorders,"Research has shown that attempts to suppress a thought can cause an increase in the frequency of the thought. These paradoxical effects of thought suppression play a key role in cognitive-behavioral models of several emotional disorders. Laboratory studies of this phenomenon, however, have yielded mixed results; and narrative summaries of the literature have not been able to draw firm conclusions about the effects of thought suppression. We used meta-analysis to quantitatively examine the magnitude of thought suppression effects across controlled studies. Moreover, we explored whether the variability in effect sizes could be explained by methodological differences within and between studies. Results indicated a small to moderate rebound effect of thought suppression that varied in magnitude depending on the nature of the target thought and the method by which thought frequency was measured. Participants with clinical diagnoses did not show larger rebound effects than nonclinical or analogue participants, however, only a few studies included clinical samples. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for the ironic process theory of thought suppression, and avenues for future research on this phenomenon.","The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) has demonstrated efficacy for treating anxiety and depression. However, there are limited effectiveness data when conducted in real-world settings with diverse populations, including those with trauma.

We examined change in overall clinical severity, depression and anxiety symptoms, functional impairment, and baseline outcome predictors (i.e., demographic characteristics, impact from Hurricane Harvey, co-occurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms). Global clinical severity, depression and anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment decreased by end-of-treatment. Participants experienced global symptom improvement to a lesser degree than demonstrated in efficacy trials. Participants who experienced greater storm impact reported larger reductions in anxiety symptoms than those less impacted by Harvey. Further studies evaluating the effectiveness of the UP post-disaster and with diverse samples are needed.","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" pertains consistently to various psychological conditions impacting emotional regulation or state, such as anxiety and depression. Text A discusses the theoretical understanding and empirical findings related to mechanisms like thought suppression that might aggravate such disorders, indicating a more basic research perspective. Meanwhile, Text B describes the application of a specific therapeutic protocol to treat these disorders, highlighting a practical, therapeutic context. Despite the different focuses—research vs. treatment—the core concept of ""emotional disorders"" remains firmly linked to conditions that primarily affect emotional wellbeing, without any significant change in the connotation or the nature of conditions described under this term over time."
39,Emotional disorders,"Several aspects of a cognitive model of vulnerability to emotional disorders based on self-discrepancy theory were tested. Anxious, dysphoric, anxious/dysphoric, and control subjects participated in 3 studies over a 4-month period: screening, assessment of self-guides and self-discrepancies, and an autobiographical memory task in which different types of retrieval cues (including self-guides) were presented and subjects reported childhood memories as they came to mind. Actual:ideal discrepancy was associated with persistent dysphoria, whereas actual:ought discrepancy was associated with persistent anxiety. Self-guide cues resulted in more efficient retrieval and greater unintended negative emotional content than comparable cue types. The groups were differentiated only by negative affect content in response to self-guide cues.","Interest in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and emotional disorders has rapidly increased over the last decade. Early theory and research focused on the relationship between IU and generalized anxiety disorder in particular; but, the roles that IU and the underlying 'fear of the unknown' play in the development, maintenance, and treatment of a broad array of emotional disorders have been explored more recently. This introduction provides a brief overview of the contributions to the special issue, which (a) summarize our current state of knowledge, (b) describe innovative methods for assessing and increasing our understanding IU within the context of various emotions and emotional disorders, (c) investigate associations between IU and therapeutic change, and (d) propose future research directions.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both texts A and B, the focus remains on understanding and discussing the dynamics and underlying causes of emotional disorders, albeit from slightly different theoretical perspectives. Text A discusses emotional disorders in relation to self-discrepancy theory and its impact on anxiety and dysphoria, while Text B explores the concept of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and its broader implications on various emotional disorders. Despite these different approaches, the core meaning and usage of ""emotional disorders"" fundamentally remains consistent, referring to a range of conditions characterized by dysfunctional emotional processes. Both texts employ the term in the context of psychological research aimed at understanding and addressing the mechanisms of such disorders. Thus, the essence of the term ""emotional disorders"" has not shifted significantly between the texts."

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used within the context of psychological issues resulting from external traumatic events experienced by children in war zones. It specifically highlights situations where the emotional disorders arise as a direct effect of trauma and stress. In Text B, however, ""emotional disorders"" are approached as a complication connected with a chronic physiological condition, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), implicating a significant shift towards understanding emotional disorders not only as psychological outcomes but also as integrated within or influenced by physical health conditions and metabolic disorders. Thus, the usage and connotation of ""emotional disorders"" have expanded from primarily trauma-induced psychological issues to include complex interrelations with physical health conditions."
41,Emotional disorders,Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is traditionally seen as a treatment for emotional disorders in adults. The paper argues that the technique can also be used with emotionally disturbed adolescents and younger children provided there is an awareness of cognitive and moral developmental processes and that these are taken into consideration. The paper discusses some of the advantages and excitement of using this technique with adolescents.,"One in one hundred minors has some mental health problem. Symptomatology varies according to gender. Most research has been conducted with the general population. The objective of this paper was to analyze the moderating role of sex in the presence of internalizing (emotional disorders, anxiety and depression) and externalizing symptomatology (behavioral disorders and hyperactivity) in childhood, as well as to compare the general population with the clinical population.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: The target word ""emotional disorders"" maintains a similar semantic framework in both texts, indicating its use as a category of mental health issues characterized primarily by significant disturbances in a person's emotions. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy, demonstrating a clinical approach to these conditions. Text B also treats ""emotional disorders"" in a clinical and research context, discussing them alongside other mental health issues like anxiety and depression, still within the sphere of mental health and emotional disturbance. Both texts clearly position emotional disorders within the clinical and psychological field without any significant shift in meaning or connotation, thereby suggesting the term remains unchanged in its usage over time regarding its association with mental health disturbances."
42,Emotional disorders,"All previous reports describing alterations in emotional reactivity after amygdala damage in monkeys were based on aspiration or radiofrequency lesions which likely disrupted fibres of passage coursing to and from adjacent ventral and medial temporal cortical areas. To determine whether this associated indirect damage was responsible for some or all of the changes described earlier, we compared the changes induced by aspiration of the amygdala with those induced by fibre-sparing neurotoxic lesions. Four different stimuli, two with and two without a social component, were used to evaluate the expression of defence, aggression, submission and approach responses. In unoperated controls, defence and approach behaviours were elicited by all four stimuli, 'social' and inanimate alike, whereas aggression and submission responses occurred only in the presence of the two 'social' stimuli. Furthermore, all defence reactions were reduced with an attractive inanimate item, while freezing was selectively increased with an aversive one. Relative to controls, monkeys with neurotoxic amygdala lesions showed the same array of behavioural changes as those with aspiration lesions, i.e. reduced fear and aggression, increased submission, and excessive manual and oral exploration. Even partial neurotoxic lesions involving less than two-thirds of the amygdala significantly altered fear and manual exploration. These findings convincingly demonstrate that the amygdala is crucial for the normal regulation of emotions in monkeys. Nevertheless, because some of the symptoms observed after neurotoxic lesions were less marked than those seen after aspiration lesions, the emotional disorders described earlier after amygdalectomy in monkeys were likely exacerbated by the attendant fibre damage.","  Nowadays, the experimental study of emotional learning is commonly based on
classical conditioning paradigms and models, which have been thoroughly
investigated in the last century. On the contrary, limited attention has been
paid to the revaluation of an unconditioned stimulus (UCS), which, as
experimentally observed by various researchers in the last four decades, occurs
out of classical conditioning. For this reason, no analytical or quantitative
theory has been developed for this phenomenon and its dynamics. Unluckily,
models based on classical conditioning are unable to explain or predict
important psychophysiological phenomena, such as the failure of the extinction
of emotional responses in certain circumstances. In this manuscript an
analytical representation of UCS revaluation learning is developed; this allows
us to identify the conditions determining the ""inextinguishability"" (or
resistant-to-extinction) property of emotional responses and reactions (such as
those observed in evaluative conditioning, in the nonreinforcement presentation
of a conditioned inhibitor, in post-traumatic stress disorders and in panic
attacks). Furthermore, an analysis of the causal relation existing between
classical conditioning and UCS revaluation is provided. Starting from this
result, a theory of implicit emotional learning and a novel interpretation of
classical conditioning are derived. Moreover, we discuss how the proposed
theory can lead to the development of new methodologies for the detection and
the treatment of undesired or pathological emotional responses, and can inspire
animal models for resistant-to-extinction responses and reactions.
","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A from an earlier period, the term ""emotional disorders"" is specifically associated with structural and behavioral alterations due to physical damage to the amygdala in monkeys, highlighting a direct link between brain damage and altered emotional responses and behaviors. This reflects a more physiological and neuroanatomical understanding of emotional disorders as largely stemming from direct brain alterations involving fear, aggression, and other primal emotions.

In contrast, Text B from a later period discusses ""emotional disorders"" within the framework of emotional learning, classical conditioning, and psychophysiological processes that include the dynamics of unconditioned stimuli and resistance to extinction in learned emotional responses. This usage encompasses a broader, more integrative understanding of emotional disorders, tying them into cognitive and behavioral frameworks including stress disorders, panic attacks, and conditions resistant to extinction.

Thus, the use of ""emotional disorders"" has shifted from a primarily physiological dysfunction due to direct brain damage perspective to a more nuanced, psycho-behavioral framework that emphasizes learned behaviors, conditioning, and cognitive processes, reflecting a significant semantic drift in the understanding and contextual usage of the term."
43,Emotional disorders,"In a comparative study of temperament profiles of groups of 30 children each diagnosed as conduct disorders, conversion disorder, emotional disorders (according to DSM-III) and normal control, it was found that the children diagnosed as conduct disorders showed high activity and intensity of emotional response as well as negative mood, those diagnosed as conversion disorder exhibited low distractibility. The significance of various temperament variables in differing clinical outcomes is discussed.","This study evaluated the cross-ethnic measurement invariance of 2 common screening measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth. The measurement invariance of the Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was tested across 881 African American (Black; n = 396), Hispanic (n = 185), non-Hispanic White (White; n = 166), and Asian/Indian (n = 134) youth in the 7th grade. The measures were administered as part of a grade-wide screening to identify youth with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms. The 5-factor model of the SCARED and the 4-factor model of the CES-D best represented the data for all ethnic groups. Results provided support for strong invariance of the SCARED across all 4 ethnic groups. Results provided support for strong invariance of the CES-D across Black, White, and Asian/Indian youth, and partial strong invariance for Hispanic youth. Overall, results suggest that factor means and total scores can be compared across groups. Factor mean differences across groups were identified for both measures. In particular, Hispanic youth reported greater levels of anxiety and depression in certain domains than White, Black, and Asian youth. Our findings support the use of the SCARED and CES-D as tools for measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms in ethnically diverse youth in the United States. Results are discussed with respect to the importance of establishing measurement invariance for screening measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms prior to comparing symptom levels across ethnic groups.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
The term ""emotional disorders"" in both texts refers consistently to a category of psychological conditions characterized primarily by dysregulated emotional responses that significantly impair functioning. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are discussed as one of the categorized psychological conditions in children alongside conduct disorders and conversion disorders, providing a clear clinical classification according to DSM-III. This suggests that ""emotional disorders"" specifically relate to recognized psychological issues with a focus on emotional aspects.

Similarly, Text B refers to ""Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED)"" which indicates a continued understanding of emotional disorders as conditions related to anxiety and depression, thus connected to the emotional state of an individual. The text also emphasizes the assessment and measurement of these conditions across different ethnic groups, further implying that ""emotional disorders"" pertain to certain dysfunctional emotional states, without deviating from its meaning in Text A.

Both texts use the term to refer to clinically significant conditions involving emotional dysregulation and thus, despite being used in different contexts (a clinical comparison in various disorders versus a validation of a screening tool), the underlying meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as psychological conditions primarily concerning emotional challenges remains constant."
44,Emotional disorders,"A survey of child psychiatric disorders was conducted in a community sample of 2441 French school-aged children selected from 18 public and private schools; children attending special classes were oversampled. A two-stage survey design was used to identify disorders. Measures were the Child Behavior Checklist and the Rutter teacher scale for screening. The Isle of Wight parental interview was used in the second phase for 217 home interviews, along with the Children Global Assessment Scale as an index of impaired functioning. Response rates were excellent, and non-respondents in the screening phase were shown to have higher levels of psychopathology as gauged by their teacher scale scores. Several weights were used in the analysis to adjust for differential probabilities of selection and participation in each survey phase. The overall prevalence rate among 8-11-year-olds was estimated to be 12.4% (5.9% for more severe disorders), with roughly equal rates of disruptive and emotional disorders (6.5% and 5.9%). Prevalence was higher in boys (15.0%) than in girls (9.5%), owing to a threefold increase in their frequency of conduct disturbances. Rates of disturbance were twice as high among children with special educational needs, while no difference was found between private and public schools. The frequency of behavioural problems appeared to be similar in the urban and semi-rural subsamples.","The clinical and imaging data in 6 patients with corticobasal syndrome were retrospectively analyzed. Six patients presented asymmetric clinical symptoms, including 5 with cognitive impairment, 6 with emotional disorders, 2 with cortical sensory deficit, 5 with lalopathy, and 4 with apraxia. All patients developed limb dystonia and limb or trunk stiffness, 4 with tumble, 4 with bradykinesia, and 2 with tremor. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that 4 patients had unilateral cerebral atrophy and 2 had mild atrophy of bilateral hippocampus. Localized low glucose metabolism in the unilateral cerebral lobe was seen in four patients by positron emission computed tomography (PET) examination, suggesting that PET is helpful for the diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used within clinical and health-related contexts, denoting a category of mental health conditions characterized by emotional disturbance, affecting mood, behavior, and cognitive processes. 

- **Text A** discusses the prevalence and types of psychiatric disorders, including emotional disorders, among school-aged children as quantified by various scales and assessments. Here, ""emotional disorders"" is specifically categorized and measured alongside other mental health issues such as disruptive disorders.

- **Text B** describes a clinical case analysis involving symptoms observed in patients with corticobasal syndrome, noting that some had ""emotional disorders"" among other neurological symptoms. The usage here aligns with the recognition of emotional disorders as part of a broader set of symptoms affecting patients, indicating that it is considered a significant aspect of their overall health condition.

In both texts, the use of ""emotional disorders"" similarly refers to mental health conditions that predominantly affect emotions, despite differences in the specific subject matter (children's psychiatric health vs. adults with a specific syndrome). There are no indications of a fundamental shift in the meaning or perception of the term ""emotional disorders,"" as it consistently relates to a type of psychological disturbance across both instances."
45,Emotional disorders,"Pediatric patients with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) were compared with patients with peptic disease, patients with emotional disorders, and well children with regard to (a) emotional and somatic symptoms and (b) theoretically derived variables, including negative life events, competence, family functioning, and the modeling and encouragement of illness behavior. RAP patients had levels of emotional distress and somatic complaints higher than those of well children and lower than those of psychiatric patients, but not different from those of patients with peptic disease. RAP patients had fewer negative life events, better family functioning, and higher competence than children with emotional disorders. In comparison with well children and psychiatric patients, both RAP and peptic disease patients had a higher incidence of illness in other family members and perceived greater parental encouragement of illness behavior for abdominal symptoms.","To explore diabetes-related knowledge levels among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the influencing factors, correlations and paths of patients' mental and emotional status based on a structural equation model. A total of 1512 patients with T2DM in 18 tertiary general hospitals in Hunan Province. A descriptive correlational study. The study was conducted and surveyed with the general information questionnaires, including the Audit of Diabetes Knowledge (AD knowl), the Problem Areas in Diabetes 5 scale (PAID-5) and the World Health Organization Five-Item Well-Being Index (WHO-5). The structural equation model showed that PAID-5 and WHO-5 scores (P < 0.05) were affected by diabetes self-management, medical history/treatment and knowledge. According to the model, the common risk factors affecting the mental and emotional status of diabetic patients were general demographic characteristics (less exercise time and greater economic burden), medical history/treatment of diabetes (longer course of disease, more hospitalizations due to diabetes, and more acute or chronic complications), and lower levels of diabetes-related knowledge. In addition, solitude was also a risk factor for low levels of happiness. The diabetes-related knowledge levels of T2DM patients are very low, and these patients generally experience emotional disorders, which deserves close attention. The structural equation model can be used to explore the influencing factors and correlations of the psychological and emotional status of diabetic patients.","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to refer to psychological or psychiatric conditions that affect the emotional and mental well-being of individuals. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are mentioned alongside other health issues, exploring their impact on children's emotional and somatic symptoms, comparing it with other conditions to highlight differences in family dynamics and individual experiences. In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" are discussed in the context of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and how their mental and emotional status links to various health and lifestyle factors, showing the distinct psychological impacts of physical health conditions on emotional well-being. In both texts, the term maintains a consistent usage focusing on psychological impacts affecting emotional states, demonstrating that the semantic meaning of ""emotional disorders"" remains unchanged across the time periods of the texts."
46,Emotional disorders,"All 1,101 clients residing in over 120 group homes of a residential services agency were surveyed on one date for presence of psychotropic medication. In all, 27% received one or more psychotropic drugs for behavioral or emotional disorders. Disorders and target behaviors listed for each drug group were examined and the relations between drug groups and diagnostic/demographic variables analyzed. In addition, logistic regression analyses were used to examine subject variable/drug relations further and the likelihood of receiving a specific class of medication given the presence of a subject variable. Certain physical and sensory handicaps were associated with less medication use. Generally speaking, the existence of DSM diagnoses (especially psychosis and mood disorder) and certain target behaviors were associated with greater medication use. In the main, medication use was consistent with known or presumptive indications for the respective drug groups, although unestablished applications were also observed.","The rapid evolution of the health emergency linked to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires specifications for the rehabilitative management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The symptomatic evolution of patients with COVID-19 is characterized by 2 phases: an acute phase in which respiratory symptoms prevail and a postacute phase in which patients can show symptoms related to prolonged immobilization, to previous and current respiratory dysfunctions, and to cognitive and emotional disorders. Thus, there is the need for specialized rehabilitative care for these patients. This communication reports the experience of the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan and recommends the setup of specialized clinical pathways for the rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19. In this hospital, between February 1 and March 2, 2020, about 50 patients were admitted every day with COVID-19 symptoms. In those days, about 400 acute care beds were created (intensive care/infectious diseases). In the following 30 days, from March 2 to mid-April, despite the presence of 60 daily arrivals to the emergency department, the organization of patient flow between different wards was modified, and several different units were created based on a more accurate integration of patients' needs. According to this new organization, patients were admitted first to acute care COVID-19 units and then to COVID-19 rehabilitation units, post-COVID-19 rehabilitation units, and/or quarantine/observation units. After hospital discharge, telemedicine was used to follow-up with patients at home. Such clinical pathways should each involve dedicated multidisciplinary teams composed of pulmonologists, physiatrists, neurologists, cardiologists, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and nutritionists.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are primarily discussed in the context of psychotropic medication management within a residential care setting, focusing on the behavioral and emotional conditions treated with drugs in psychiatric practice. The term is used to describe disorders treated under established psychiatric diagnostic categories, such as DSM diagnoses, generally indicating internal psychological conditions that might affect emotions and behaviors.

In Text B, however, ""emotional disorders"" are referenced as part of the broader symptomatic spectrum seen in patients recovering from COVID-19. Here, the term is used to describe a set of symptoms associated with the aftermath of a severe infectious disease, incorporating a larger biopsychosocial framework that includes the physiological impact of the virus and prolonged hospitalization. This usage implies that the term has expanded beyond a strict psychiatric context to encompass more holistic health considerations, possibly influenced by the multisystem effects of COVID-19 on psychological wellness.

Thus, the semantic drift is apparent as ""emotional disorders"" in the latest text includes a broader definition, influenced by systemic health impacts rather than being strictly confined to psychiatric diagnoses."
47,Emotional disorders,"Pediatric collaboration with mental health professionals is necessary due to the high prevalence of behavioral and emotional disorders in this population. Clinicians frequently encounter parental resistance to acceptance and follow-through on recommended mental health services. In addition, physicians may have difficulty recognizing and referring psychosocial problems due to inadequate training or experience. The case presented of a 10-year-old girl with enuresis illustrates the process of referring a patient with a behavioral problem from a general pediatrician to a mental health specialist. The behavioral pediatrician plays a critical role in providing linkage between medical and psychosocial care.","Impaired positive autobiographical memory (AM) is closely linked to emotional disorders. AM impairments are often found in depressed adults and may be related to the difficulties such persons have in regulating their dysphoric mood. By contrast, less is known about AM disturbances among adolescents, or about the functional relationship of AM disturbances to early-onset depression.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used in a general clinical context, focusing on the prevalence and challenges of managing these disorders pediatrically, particularly the logistical aspects of diagnosis and referral to specialists. The usage here is broad, encompassing a range of disorders without specifying symptoms or underlying physiological or psychological mechanisms.

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is directly linked with specific cognitive functions, notably impaired positive autobiographical memory (AM), which is discussed as having a functional relationship with conditions like depression. This suggests a more nuanced understanding of emotional disorders that focuses on specific cognitive disruptions and their implications for mood regulation and mental health.

This shift from a broad clinical management perspective to a detailed focus on cognitive and mood aspects indicates a significant semantic drift in the use of ""emotional disorders,"" reflecting deeper insights into the interplay between cognitive functions and emotional health over time."
48,Emotional disorders,"We investigated the degree of content specificity evident in the negative cognitions associated with anxiety and depression in two large samples of general psychiatric outpatients. Standardized measures of affect and cognition were analyzed in a multiple regression design. As predicted by Beck's (1967, 1976, 1987) cognitive theory of psychopathology, thoughts of loss and failure were specifically associated with depression, whereas cognitions of harm and danger were uniquely predictive of anxiety. In addition, hopelessness was specific to depression and not to anxiety. Dysfunctional beliefs showed no consistent association with either mood state. The implication of these results, as well as related findings, is discussed in terms of a cognitive perspective on the differentiation of emotional disorders. Also discussed are the methodological difficulties encountered in research on cognitive-affective relationships.","This paper reviews community residents' mental health following exposure to a community disaster trauma, with a focus on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health outcomes, such as emotional disorders, behavioral problems including addictive disorders, and personality as a maladaptive trait. This review concludes with recommendations to advance the field of community disaster research by exploring how natural and man-made disasters impact community residents across multiple domains. Moreover, this study suggests that residents impacted by community disaster trauma are frequently appropriate targets for mental health assessments or services in a community setting.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A from an earlier period, ""emotional disorders"" primarily refers to classical psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression, focusing on specific cognitive patterns and distinctions between different emotional disorders within a psychiatric framework. The language targets the differentiation of disorders based on cognitive-affective relationships and evidence from psychological assessments. In Text B from a more recent period, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used in the context of outcomes from community-wide disaster trauma, alongside terms like PTSD, behavioral problems, and personality issues. The focus here shifts towards a broader and more situational understanding of ""emotional disorders"" as reactions to external traumatic events rather than intrinsic cognitive patterns. This indicates a semantic drift where the context and perceived causes of ""emotional disorders"" have expanded to include environmental and situational factors, not just internal cognitive processes."
49,Emotional disorders,"As a part of the World Health Organization multicentric study of emotional disorders in general medical care, we studied patients who had a chronic medical ailment and a psychiatric disorder, according to ICD-10.","Overgeneral memory (OGM) refers to difficulty in retrieving specific autobiographical memories. The tendency to be overgeneral in autobiographical memory recall is more commonly observed among individuals with emotional disorders compared with those without. Despite significant advances in theory and identification of mechanisms that underlie the etiology of OGM, there has been little integration between normative research on the development of autobiographical memory and research on OGM. Informed by a developmental psychopathology perspective and drawing on normative developmental research on the social construction of autobiographical memory, the current investigation examined whether the elaborative quantity and elaborative quality of maternal reminiscing are predictive of preschool-age children's autobiographical memory specificity. Additionally, this investigation tested whether children's positive self-representations may explain these hypothesized associations. Participants consisted of 95 mother-child dyads. Children's ages ranged between 3.5 and 6 years, and the sample was predominantly low income and of minority race/ethnicity. Dyads participated in a joint reminiscing task about 4 past events, and children participated in assessments of autobiographical memory specificity and self-representations. Results indicated that the elaborative quality, defined by maternal-sensitive guidance and emotional narrative coherence, but not the elaborative quantity, of maternal reminiscing style was significantly associated with children's autobiographical memory specificity. Additionally, there was support for an indirect pathway between maternal reminiscing quality and child memory specificity through children's positive self-representations. Directions for future research are discussed, and potential clinical implications are addressed.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both texts provided, the term ""emotional disorders"" retains its fundamental meaning of psychological or psychiatric conditions that affect an individual’s emotional state and ability to function. Text A refers to patients diagnosed with both chronic medical ailments and psychiatric disorders categorized under ""emotional disorders"" as per a global healthcare standard (ICD-10). Here, the term is directly associated with diagnosed psychological conditions in a medical context, indicating a clear and clinical use of the term within healthcare research and practice.

In Text B, the discussion revolves around a psychological phenomenon known as Overgeneral Memory (OGM), which is more prevalent in individuals with ""emotional disorders."" The text explores how these disorders can affect cognitive functions, specifically the retrieval of autobiographical memories. The usage underscores the relationship between emotional disorders and memory functionality, still within a psychological or psychiatric context.

In both periods of observation, the central connotation of ""emotional disorders"" as psychological conditions with specific symptoms and impacts remains consistent. The text provides different exploratory angles on the disorders but does not alter the underlying meaning of the term, demonstrating that ""emotional disorders"" has not undergone a significant semantic drift but rather sees extended contextual applications while retaining its core definition."

Differential diagnosis and treatment are described.","  Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience deficits in verbal
and nonverbal communication skills including motor control, turn-taking, and
emotion recognition. Innovative technology, such as socially assistive robots,
has shown to be a viable method for Autism therapy. This paper presents a novel
robot-based music-therapy platform for modeling and improving the social
responses and behaviors of children with ASD. Our autonomous social interactive
system consists of three modules. We adopted Short-time Fourier Transform and
Levenshtein distance to fulfill the design requirements: a) ""music detection""
and b) ""smart scoring and feedback"", which allows NAO to understand music and
provide additional practice and oral feedback to the users as applicable. We
designed and implemented six Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) sessions including
four intervention sessions. Nine children with ASD and seven Typically
Developing participated in a total of fifty HRI experimental sessions. Using
our platform, we collected and analyzed data on social behavioral changes and
emotion recognition using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals. The results of
our experiments demonstrate most of the participants were able to complete
motor control tasks with ~70% accuracy. Six out of the 9 ASD participants
showed stable turn-taking behavior when playing music. The results of automated
emotion classification using Support Vector Machines illustrate that emotional
arousal in the ASD group can be detected and well recognized via EDA
bio-signals. In summary, the results of our data analyses, including emotion
classification using EDA signals, indicate that the proposed robot-music based
therapy platform is an attractive and promising assistive tool to facilitate
the improvement of fine motor control and turn-taking skills in children with
ASD.

It is used to describe a broader range of psychological symptoms possibly due to an underlying medical condition. In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" implicitly referred to involves difficulties in emotion recognition and social responses particularly in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Here, it is specifically related to the treatment and assessment of social and emotional capabilities in a therapeutic setting. The context shifts from a generalized medical condition affecting emotions in Text A, to specific disorders impacting emotional and social interactions in Text B, indicating a shift in focus and application of the term over time."
51,Emotional disorders,"Psychosocial disorders frequently complicate sickle cell disease. Psychological problems include neurotic illness, personality changes and psychotic reactions. Social problems may relate to work, marital and financial difficulties. Patients' siblings, parents and significant others may also suffer from emotional disorders. The role of nonpsychiatric medical and para-medical personnel in the identification and management of the psychosocial complications of sickle cell disease was mentioned. The need to pay more attention to preventive measures such as genetic counselling was also emphasized.","Increasing evidence consistently indicates that cortical mechanisms play important roles in chronic pain and its emotional disorders. Central synapses, especially excitatory synapses, are undergoing long-term memory-like plastic changes after peripheral injury. These changes not only occur at the single synaptic level, but also take place at cortical and subcortical circuits. Consequently, neuronal responses to peripheral sensory stimuli, or even to sensory inputs triggered by normal physiological signals such as touch and movement, are significantly potentiated or increased. Such prolonged cortical excitation likely contributes to chronic pain and its related emotional changes. In this short review article, I will summarize recent progress using animal models and explore possible different mechanisms that may contribute to chronic pain in the brain.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" is primarily portrayed in the context of psychological issues related to patients with sickle cell disease and extends to social and familial dysfunctions. The focus is on the psychosocial complications arising from chronic illness. In Text B, however, the use of ""emotional disorders"" shifts to a biological and neurological emphasis, particularly in relation to chronic pain. Here, the term refers to changes in the brain's cortical structures and synaptic behaviors that result from physical injury leading to emotional alterations. The focus on neurological substrates as bases of these disorders marks a significant shift from the broader psychosocial implications discussed in Text A. Thus, the word ""emotional disorders"" has experienced a drift in usage from encompassing general psychological and societal effects to a specific biological and neurological understating associated with physical conditions."
52,Emotional disorders,Family dysfunction is an important determinant of childhood disturbance. Emotional disorders may present overtly or through somatic symptoms and the family doctor must be alert to their relationship to disturbances within the family. Early intervention may avert more serious problems in childhood.,"While modular and transdiagnostic approaches may address implementation challenges, there remains limited investigation into the fit within large healthcare systems. The current study examines qualitative interviews from patients, clinicians and administrative stakeholders in the Veterans Administration about experiences with, and views of, the Unified Protocol (UP; Barlow et al. in The unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders: therapist guide, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) to understand potential for implementation. Qualitative interviews were conducted based on an established implementation framework and speak to implementation of transdiagnostic treatment in veterans, including insight into barriers, facilitators, intervention characteristics, patient characteristics, and system level variables. The UP demonstrated promise for improving efficiency, satisfaction and personalizing mental healthcare.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the focus is on emotional disorders within the context of family dynamics, emphasizing the presentation of disorders through somatic symptoms and the importance of early intervention by family doctors to prevent further problems in childhood. The usage here suggests a more general and broad interpretation of emotional disorders related to everyday family and social interactions.

In Text B, emotional disorders are discussed in a specific clinical and systemic context, highlighting the implementation and effectiveness of a particular psychotherapeutic protocol (Unified Protocol) within a large healthcare system like the Veterans Administration. The discussion revolves around mental health treatment efficiencies, veteran-specific healthcare implementations, and the broader implications of a unified, transdiagnostic approach to therapy. This use indicates a shift towards a more technical, medical, and systemic view of emotional disorders, focusing on streamlined and efficient therapy modalities applicable across a range of disorders.

The semantic drift from a general, family-focused view in Text A to a highly specialized, clinical, and systemic application in Text B signifies a significant shift in the contextual and practical application of the term ""emotional disorders""."
53,Emotional disorders,"Network theory is a relatively recent explanatory development to improve our understanding of emotions and emotional disorders. Connectionist neural networks are introduced as mathematically well-defined network theories that have been suggested as PTSD models, partly because of their ability to form and retrieve memories. Explanatory requirements that a comprehensive PTSD theory must have are reviewed. A connectionist neural network system called the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is extended to encode emotion and cognition and is then shown to satisfy all PTSD explanatory requirements and consequently constitutes a comprehensive PTSD theory. Empirical work pertaining to a fundamental assumption that learning alters brain structure in ways that can be detected by neuroimaging is reviewed. Novel predictions are made, and relevance to neuroscience is discussed.","129 patients aged 18-84 in early rehabilitation period of the first hemispheric ischemic stroke and 48 patients with cerebrovascular disorders without stroke in anamnesis were observed.

Investigation was carried out twice during the early recovery period 3-4weeks and 3months after the stroke. Statistically significant decrease of cognitive functions in comparison with control group data was revealed. Cognitive deficiency and depressed mood were fixed in patients after the first hemispheric ischemic stroke. The level of cognitive decline correlated with expression of neurological deficiency and age. The expression of hypothymia correlated with age, dominated by women, did not depend on stroke localization and education. Women, elderly people and patients with severe neurological deficits had higher risk of emotional disorders after the first hemispheric ischemic stroke. There was a tendency to reduce the frequency of hypothymia and cognitive decline in the early rehabilitation period.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is discussed in the context of a complex integration of cognition and emotion via neural networks and their relation to PTSD, reflecting a specialized, theory-oriented psychological and neurological perspective. In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is used more broadly to describe emotional and psychological disturbances observed in stroke patients, including aspects of mood and cognitive functions, positioning it closer to a clinical observational perspective. This indicates a significant shift in the context and connotation from a specific theoretical framework to a generalized clinical application, marking a semantic drift in the usage of ""emotional disorders."" Thus, the term has expanded to encompass a wider range of clinical and cognitive implications over time."
54,Emotional disorders,Recent reports on the use of psychotropic medications for preschool-aged children with behavioral and emotional disorders warrant further examination of trends in the type and extent of drug therapy and sociodemographic correlates.,"Experience of childhood abuse is prevalent among patients with eating disorders, and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is implicated in its pathophysiology. Neonatal maternal separation is considered as an animal model of stressful experience early in life. Many of studies have demonstrated its impact both on the activity of HPA axis and the development of psycho-emotional disorders later in life. In this paper, a series of our researches on developing an animal model of eating disorders is reviewed. An animal model of neonatal maternal separation was used; Sprague-Dawley pups were separated from dam daily for 180 min during the first 2 weeks of life (MS) or undisturbed. Anxiety-/depression-like behaviors were observed in MS rats at the age of two months with decreased serotonergic activity in the hippocampus and the raphe. Post-weaning social isolation promoted food intake and weight gain of adolescent MS pups, with impacts on anxiety-like behaviors. Sustained hyperphagia was observed in the MS pups subjected to a fasting/refeeding cycle repeatedly during adolescence, with increased plasma corticosterone levels. Anhedonia, major symptom of depression, to palatable food was observed in adolescent MS pups with blunted response of the mesolimbic dopaminergic activity to stress. Results suggest that neonatal maternal separation lead to the development of eating disorders when it is challenged with social or metabolic stressors later in life, in which dysfunctions in the HPA axis and the brain monoaminergic systems may play important roles.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used in a broad clinical context focusing on the use of psychotropic medications and examining sociodemographic correlations within the pediatric population. The emphasis here is on medical therapy, types of drugs used, and population-based observations regarding these disorders.

  In contrast, Text B significantly shifts to a more detailed and specific neurobiological perspective. It discusses ""emotional disorders"" within the framework of developmental trauma (like neonatal maternal separation) and its lasting impact on neuroendocrine functions, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Furthermore, the usage extends to explore the contributing factors from early life stress to the development of specific disorders like eating disorders and depression-like behaviors in animal models. This also includes a focus on physiological changes such as altered serotonergic activity and dopaminergic responses, denoting a more in-depth understanding of the pathophysiology and neurobiology of emotional disorders over time.

  Therefore, the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" has broadened and deepened from a mainly therapeutic and demographic perspective to a detailed biopsychosocial model incorporating early life experiences, neurobiological changes, and specific behavioral outcomes. This represents a significant shift in the contextual and connotative use of the term over time, reflecting advancements in understanding and researching these conditions."

Whether this elevated risk extends into young adulthood - and to which specific disorders - has rarely been tested with long-term prospective-longitudinal community samples. Here we test whether frequent and recurring stomach aches, headaches, and muscle aches during childhood predict emotional disorders in adulthood after accounting for childhood psychiatric and physical health status and psychosocial adversity.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""emotional disorders"" refers to psychological conditions that affect the emotional state and are treated or studied in a health care or clinical setting. Text A discusses training community nurses in problem-solving therapy to treat emotional disorders within primary care, indicating a clinical treatment approach. In Text B, the discussion revolves around long-term studies tracking children with somatic complaints and their increased risk of emotional disorders into adulthood, still focusing on the impact and understanding of emotional disorders within a health-focused context. Both texts maintain a consistent clinical and health-oriented perspective regarding emotional disorders, emphasizing the unchanged meaning and context of the term across the years."
56,Emotional disorders,"The paper reviews the forthcoming ICD-10 which is planned to replace ICD-9 in the early nineties. Out of the three sections provided for classifying disorders usually first evident in childhood the numbers F 90 to 99 ""behavioral and emotional disorders specific to childhood and adolescence"" and F 80 to 89 ""developmental disorders"" are discussed in detail.","Abnormalities in mental imagery have been implicated in a range of mental health conditions. Imagery has a particularly powerful effect on emotion and as such plays a particularly important role in emotional disorders. In depression, not only is the occurrence of intrusive negative imagery problematic, but also the lack of positive (in particular, future-directed) imagery is important. The authors suggest that, in depression, imagery can exacerbate the effects of interpretation bias. This article outlines an experimental psychopathology subcomponents model of depression that focuses specifically on the role of imagery and interpretation bias in the maintenance of the disorder. The authors propose that negative intrusive imagery, a lack of positive imagery, and negative interpretation bias serve both independently and interactively to maintain depressed mood. Finally, the authors consider the implications of this imagery-based approach for the development of new cognitive treatments in this area.","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to a range of mental health conditions that primarily affect emotions. Text A uses the term in a more generalized and categorical classification context within ICD codifications, emphasizing that certain emotional disorders are specific to children and adolescents. Text B discusses the specific impacts of mental imagery on emotional disorders, providing detailed insights particularly into depression, which is identified as one form of emotional disorder. In both cases, though the contexts and detailed exploration vary, the underlying understanding of ""emotional disorders"" as conditions impacting emotional well-being remains consistent across both texts. This indicates that the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" has not experienced significant semantic drift and remains centered around issues related to emotional health."
57,Emotional disorders,"Following the significant industrialization of private health care, managed care strategies for reducing costs are beginning to enter the public sector. Privatization of public mental health dollars is already a reality in some states and a growing possibility in many others. Changes in the financial management of behavioral health care are a source of concern for providers, advocates, and clients who desire services that are consistent with the core values of an integrated system of care. This article reviews the core values of the system of care for children and families, recent changes in the continuum of care for children with severe emotional disorders, and basic principles and strategies of managed care. It is proposed that system-of-care values and managed care principles are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a judicious combination of systems-of-care values and private sector management strategies may facilitate cross-system integration of services for children and youth. An example of a private, nonprofit corporation designed to manage public sector dollars across child welfare, juvenile justice, and mental health/alcohol and drug addiction systems is presented.","Examining parent-child agreement for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents is essential for informing the assessment of trauma-exposed children, yet no studies have examined this relationship using appropriate statistical techniques. Parent-child agreement for these disorders was examined by structured interview in a prospective study of assault and motor vehicle accident (MVA) child survivors, assessed at 2-4 weeks and 6 months post-trauma. Children were significantly more likely to meet criteria for ASD, as well as other ASD and PTSD symptom clusters, based on their own report than on their parent's report. Parent-child agreement for ASD was poor (Cohen's kappa = -.04), but fair for PTSD (Cohen's kappa = .21). Agreement ranged widely for other emotional disorders (Cohen's kappa = -.07-.64), with generalised anxiety disorder found to have superior parent-child agreement (when assessed by phi coefficients) relative to ASD and PTSD. The findings support the need to directly interview children and adolescents, particularly for the early screening of posttraumatic stress, and suggest that other anxiety disorders may have a clearer presentation post-trauma.","###Answer:
- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" broadly refers to a spectrum of mental health conditions affecting children and families, highlighting systemic care, management strategies, and integration in public care systems. Here, ""emotional disorders"" is portrayed within the context of healthcare management, primarily focusing on the structural and financial aspects of providing care to affected individuals within a managed system. The discussion is centered around strategic care management more than the disorders themselves. 

  In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is specifically linked to acute clinical conditions like Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following traumatic experiences. The term is used within a clinical diagnostic context, discussing the reliability of symptom reporting between parents and children after traumatic events. The focus is narrower and more clinical, highlighting the challenges in diagnostic concordance and the necessity of direct assessment methods tailored toward individual symptoms and disorders, particularly in the context of trauma.

  The shift from a broader, system-wide perspective to a focused, trauma-based diagnostic concern indicates a notable change in how ""emotional disorders"" are contextualized and discussed over the periods represented by the texts."
58,Emotional disorders,"The effects of parental divorce during childhood and adolescence on the mental health of young adults (age 23) were examined, using the National Child Development Study (NCDS), a longitudinal, multimethod, nationally representative survey of all children born in Great Britain during 1 week in 1958 (N = 17,414). Children were assessed at birth and subsequently followed up at ages 7, 11, 16, and 23 by means of maternal and child interviews, and by psychological, school, and medical assessments. Parental divorce had a moderate, long-term negative impact on adult mental health, as measured by the Malaise Inventory total score, and controlling for economic status, children's emotional problems, and school performance preceding marital dissolution. The likelihood of scoring above the clinical cutoff of the Malaise Inventory rose from 8% to 11% due to parental divorce. This indicated that the relative risk of serious emotional disorders increased in the aftermath of divorce, but that the large majority of individuals did not exhibit such risks. Path analyses revealed that the negative effects of divorce on adult mental health operated indirectly through higher emotional problems and lower levels of school achievement and family economic status at age 16. Results related to timing of divorce, remarriage, and interactions between age 7 emotional problems and divorce, and between age 7 emotional problems and child gender, are also discussed.","Being a housewife may already be a psychosocial risk factor leading to chronic stress and burnout, and this may be aggravated when the housewife must also become the caregiver of a family member with Alzheimer's.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used within the context of significant psychological or mental health issues impacting individuals due to specific life circumstances or roles. Text A discusses ""emotional disorders"" developing as a long-term effect of parental divorce during childhood and adolescence, focusing on the sustained negative impact on mental health, assessed by increased instances of serious emotional disorders and related to other life outcomes like school performance and economic status. Similarly, Text B emphasizes ""emotional disorders"" in the context of chronic stress and burnout among housewives who also take on caregiving roles, particularly pointing out the severity of psychological impacts connected with such demanding responsibilities. In both examples, ""emotional disorders"" remain closely associated with adverse psychological reactions to difficult life conditions, maintaining consistent connotations and implications over time."
59,Emotional disorders,"A substantial body of research evidence over the past three decades has indicated that intellectual and emotional impairment among parents is a factor contributing to child abuse and neglect. This study examined the court records of 206 seriously abused or neglected children and their families in a large urban area and found that in over half the records a parent had been diagnosed as having an emotional disorder and/or low IQ, with a majority of these diagnoses indicating significant impairment. Although type of impairment (emotional, low IQ, and a subsample of substance abusers) did not predict type of mistreatment, higher predicted risk for continued mistreatment, or greater likelihood of permanent removal of the child by the court, low IQ parents revealed significantly less prior court involvement and greater acceptance of court-ordered services. Parents diagnosed with serious emotional disorders were significantly more likely than less disturbed parents to have their children permanently removed despite findings of no significant differences in risk or compliance factors.","It is widely known that a good balance and healthy function for bacteria groups in the colon are necessary to maintain homeostasis and preserve health. However, the lack of consensus on what defines a healthy gut microbiota and the multitude of factors that influence human gut microbiota composition complicate the development of appropriate dietary recommendations for our gut microbiota. Furthermore, the varied response to the intake of probiotics and prebiotics observed in healthy adults suggests the existence of potential inter- and intra-individual factors, which might account for gut microbiota changes to a greater extent than diet. The changing dietary habits worldwide involving consumption of processed foods containing artificial ingredients, such as sweeteners; the coincident rise in emotional disorders; and the worsening of other lifestyle habits, such as smoking habits, drug consumption, and sleep, can together contribute to gut dysbiosis and health impairment, as well as the development of chronic diseases. This review summarizes the current literature on the effects of specific dietary ingredients (probiotics, prebiotics, alcohol, refined sugars and sweeteners, fats) in the gut microbiota of healthy adults and the potential inter- and intra-individual factors involved, as well as the influence of other potential lifestyle factors that are dramatically increasing nowadays.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is specifically tied to a clinical analysis of individuals associated with child abuse and neglect cases, focusing particularly on the direct psychological implications and diagnostic aspects of such disorders. The context revolves around clearly identifiable psychiatric conditions affecting parental behavior and decisions by the court concerning child custody.

On the other hand, Text B discusses ""emotional disorders"" in a broader societal context, focusing on lifestyle factors and diet, such as the consumption of processed foods, alcohol, sweeteners, and their overall impact on gut health, which indirectly influences emotional wellbeing. Here, ""emotional disorders"" are linked to gut microbiota, and how lifestyle changes and dietary habits can contribute to psychological states, framing emotional disorders more as part of a complex interaction between biological, dietary, and environmental factors rather than strictly clinical psychiatric diagnoses.

This shift from a clinical, diagnostic context to a more integrated, holistic perspective involving dietary, environmental, and lifestyle factors indicates a significant semantic drift in the usage and interpretation of ""emotional disorders."""
60,Emotional disorders,"Twenty-eight children with developmental disorders underwent an interdisciplinary assessment for diagnosis and recommendations about management. Following this assessment, the degree of agreement on diagnosis and recommendations between parents and the team was determined. There was substantial agreement for diagnosis of clearly identifiable conditions such as genetic disorders, autism, and mental retardation but less agreement for milder disorders such as learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and emotional disorders. Agreement on management varied, being higher for speech therapy and psychosocial interventions but lower for use of stimulant medication and diet. The parents identified additional diagnostic labels in their child and mentioned more recommendations than the clinicians prescribed. The results suggest the need for careful attention to parent perceptions following interdisciplinary assessment.","Over 40 years of development of cognitive behavioral approaches to treating anxiety and related emotional disorders have left us with highly efficacious treatments that are increasingly widely accepted. Nevertheless, these manualized protocols have become numerous and somewhat complex, restricting effective training and dissemination. Deepening understanding of the nature of emotional disorders reveals that commonalities in etiology and latent structure among these disorders supercedes differences. This suggests the possibility of distilling a set of psychological procedures that would comprise a unified intervention for emotional disorders. Based on theory and data emerging from the fields of learning, emotional development and regulation, and cognitive science, we identify three fundamental therapeutic components relevant to the treatment of emotional disorders generally. These three components include (a) altering antecedent cognitive reappraisals; (b) preventing emotional avoidance; and (c) facilitating action tendencies not associated with the emotion that is dysregulated. This treatment takes place in the context of provoking emotional expression (emotional exposure) through situational, internal, and somatic (interoceptive cues), as well as through standard mood-induction exercises, and differs from patient to patient only in the situational cues and exercises utilized. Theory and rationale supporting this new approach are described along with some preliminary experience with the protocol. This unified treatment may represent a more efficient and possibly a more effective strategy in treating emotional disorders, pending further evaluation.","###Answer:
- Target word: Emotional disorders
- Text A: In this context, ""emotional disorders"" are listed among developmental or learning disabilities. They are considered in a clinical and diagnostic scenario for children, focusing on the ambiguity and differences in diagnosis and management perceptions between professionals and parents. Here, emotional disorders are acknowledged and managed within a broad spectrum of child developmental issues.
- Text B: It discusses ""emotional disorders"" in the context of psychological research and treatment advancements, specifically referencing the evolution of cognitive-behavioral therapies. The mention underscores a shift towards understanding commonalities among various disorders and refining therapeutic approaches to manage them more effectively and generically. This perspective is more specialized and treatment-focused than in Text A.

This indicates a significant evolution in context and focus, qualifying as a semantic drift."
61,Emotional disorders,"In a prospective Multi-Centre research study involving four British Adolescent Psychiatry Inpatient Units, all 276 adolescent admissions were diagnosed using both ICD-9 and DSM-III. Ratings of diagnostic confidence for each diagnostic group varied considerably. Clinicians recorded high levels of confidence in the diagnosis of both Schizophrenia and Anorexia nervosa, while considerably lower scores were noted for Adjustment Disorders (ICD-9 3-digit code 309.), and for Emotional Disorders (ICD-9 3-digit code 313.). Exact concordance in diagnoses made for each case using both ICD-9 and DSM-III occurred in 72% of the entire cohort. The dissimilar concordance rates comparing ICD-9 and DSM-III diagnoses for the same patient admissions suggest differences in validity measures, such as face validity and content validity, in the reliability of diagnostic criteria between similarly named disorders across the two systems, and in the clinician's training and attitude to diagnosis. With the recent introduction of DSM-IV following upon ICD-10, further comparative studies are needed to examine both reliability and validity issues into diagnosis and classification in child and adolescent psychiatry.","This editorial highlights the limitations of preclinical models in accurately reflecting the complexity of anxiety and depression, which leads to a lack of effective treatments for these disorders. Inconsistencies in experimental designs and methodologies can entail conflicting or inconclusive findings, while an overreliance on medication can mask underlying problems. Researchers are exploring new approaches to preclinical modeling of negative emotional disorders, including using patient-derived cells, developing more complex animal models, and integrating genetic and environmental factors. Advanced technologies, such as optogenetics, chemogenetics and neuroimaging, are also being employed to improve the specificity and selectivity of preclinical models. Collaboration and innovation across different disciplines and sectors are needed to address complex societal challenges, which requires new models of funding and support that prioritize cooperation and multidisciplinary research. By harnessing the power of technology and new ways of working, researchers can collaborate more effectively to bring about transformative change.","### Answer:
- **Label:** Changed
- **Reason:**
  - **Text A** refers to ""Emotional Disorders"" in a clinical diagnostic context related to child and adolescent psychiatry, utilizing specific ICD and DSM codes as classification methods. Here, the meaning of ""Emotional Disorders"" is strictly tied to formal medical diagnosis and aims to catalog these disorders in an objective, clinical, and somewhat rigid manner based on recognized standards.
  - **Text B**, on the other hand, takes a more dynamic and experimental approach to ""Emotional Disorders,"" which refers more broadly to conditions like anxiety and depression without strict adherence to specific diagnostic categories. The focus is on the complexity and diversity of these disorders, reflecting a shift towards understanding them through innovative research methods and integrating various aspects beyond traditional clinical diagnostics.
  - The shift from a purely diagnostic classification to a broader, more nuanced understanding of these disorders, including genetic, environmental, and technological aspects, indicates a significant change in how the term ""Emotional Disorders"" is approached and understood between the two texts."
62,Emotional disorders,"The present study examined the usefulness of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) as a means of screening for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Using receiver operating characteristic analyses, the accuracy of the PSWQ in screening for GAD was examined in both clinical and analogue diagnosed GAD samples. Given high comorbidity between GAD and other emotional disorders, we also investigated the usefulness of the PSWQ in selecting non-cases of GAD that were also free of PTSD, social phobia, or depression versus non-cases of GAD that met criteria for one of these conditions. The overall usefulness of the PSWQ as a screening device is discussed.","The study investigated implicit memory function in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and its association with clinical parameters. Implicit memory refers to the influence of past experience on current behavior without conscious awareness of these experiences. Eighteen FMS patients and 25 healthy individuals accomplished a word-stem completion task. As possible factors mediating the expected impairment, pain severity, emotional disorders, and medication were taken into account. The patients displayed markedly reduced task performance and higher levels of depression and anxiety. Among the clinical features, pain severity was most closely associated with performance, whereas depression, anxiety, and medication showed only a minor impact. The study documented reduced implicit memory function in FMS. In contrast to former findings on impaired performance of FMS patients on classical memory tests, lower implicit memory function cannot be ascribed to motivational deficits. Instead, the aberrances may relate to functional inference between central nervous nociceptive activity and cognitive processing.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the use of the phrase ""emotional disorders"" consistently refers to a range of psychological conditions that include symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Text A discusses the use of a questionnaire to screen for GAD alongside other emotional disorders such as PTSD, social phobia, or depression, indicating a broad scope of psychological issues grouped under ""emotional disorders."" Similarly, Text B relates ""emotional disorders"" to conditions impacting cognitive function, specifically in patients with fibromyalgia, noting the impact of depression and anxiety. In both contexts, ""emotional disorders"" is used to denote conditions that affect emotional stability and psychological health, maintaining a similar meaning across both timeframes without any significant semantic drift."
63,Emotional disorders,"The author sees the task of industrial psychiatry as one of preventing emotional maladjustment and the more serious mental disorders in the industrial population, and of treating early cases of emotional disorders. He classifies the preventive functions as: giving ""emotional"" first-aid, holding psychiatric consultations, and training in mental health. The function of the psychiatrist is to concentrate on patients who are too difficult to be handled by the industrial medical officer, his nurse, or the psychologist, and to train management and medical staff to collaborate in preventive mental health activity. Some of the techniques used by the psychiatrist are described, and the important problem of how to handle confidential material is discussed.The author points out that the selection of medical staff for such work is extremely important, and that choosing the right type of psychiatrist is of primary importance for the whole organization.","Chronic pain is a common neurological disease involving lasting, multifaceted maladaptations ranging from gene modulation to synaptic dysfunction and emotional disorders. Sustained pathological stimuli in many diseases alter the output activities of certain genes through epigenetic modifications, but it is unclear how epigenetic mechanisms operate in the development of chronic pain. We show here that in the rat brainstem nucleus raphe magnus, which is important for central mechanisms of chronic pain, persistent inflammatory and neuropathic pain epigenetically suppresses Gad2 (encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)) transcription through histone deacetylase (HDAC)-mediated histone hypoacetylation, resulting in impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic inhibition. Gad2 knockout mice showed sensitized pain behavior and impaired GABA synaptic function in their brainstem neurons. In wild-type but not Gad2 knockout mice, HDAC inhibitors strongly increased GAD65 activity, restored GABA synaptic function and relieved sensitized pain behavior. These findings suggest GAD65 and HDACs as potential therapeutic targets in an epigenetic approach to the treatment of chronic pain.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers primarily to psychological issues related to industrial work environments, focusing on maladjustment and preventative mental health measures. The emphasis is on emotional well-being within the context of occupational health and mitigation against job-related stress. In contrast, Text B discusses ""emotional disorders"" within the complex biochemical and neurological framework of chronic pain, implicating genetic and synaptic factors. Here, the term is embedded within a scientific discussion of brain mechanisms and gene expression, showing a shift from a purely psychological context to a bio-neurological perspective. This indicates a broadening in the understanding and application of the term, pointing to a semantic drift."

The US group had participated in the acute care of the children 7 months before. Major sequelae observed were hepatitis, cardiomyopathy and severe emotional disorders. Reconstructive surgery for burn scars was jointly planned and carried out during a 2-week period of mutually instructive cooperation.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the deposition of β-amyloid (βA) peptides in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Flavonoids have recently been used to prevent and treat a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about bioflavonoids. In this study, we evaluate whether a biflavonoid fraction (BF) exerts neuroprotective effects on an aged triple transgenic mouse mode of AD (3xTg-AD). Then, 21-24-month-old 3xTg AD mice were i.p. injected with 25mg/kg of a BF from Garcinia madruno composed of morelloflavone (65%), volkensiflavone (12%), GB 2a (11%), fukugiside (6%) and amentoflavone (0.4%) every 48h for 3 months. The BF treatment reduced βA deposition in different regions of the brain (the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala), reduced βA1-40 and βA1-42 levels, BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP (CTFβ), tau pathology, astrogliosis and microgliosis in the brains of aged 3xTg-AD mice. Although the BF treatment weakly improved learning, animals treated with BF spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze test and displayed greater risk assessment behavior than the control groups. In summary, the BF reverses histopathological hallmarks and reduces emotional disorders in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, suggesting that the biflavonoids from G. madruno represent a potential natural therapeutic option for AD if its bioavailability is improved.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to a range of psychological disturbances or conditions affecting the emotion regulation or behavior of individuals. Text A discusses ""emotional disorders"" as a significant sequel affecting children who were involved in a traumatic accident, indicating a negative psychological impact resulting from the trauma. In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" are mentioned in the context of Alzheimer’s disease where the treatment with biflavonoids not only addresses the pathological hallmarks of the disease but also helps in reducing emotional disorders, suggesting the alleviation of psychological symptoms in the neurodegenerative condition. Both contexts describe emotional disorders as significant psychological impacts needing attention and management, consistent across both texts despite the varying medical conditions they associate with. Hence, the usage of the target word indicates no significant semantic drift and maintains a similar meaning in both medical and psychological contexts over time."
65,Emotional disorders,"This paper begins by reviewing the current status of primary prevention. Basic concepts and definitions are introduced, and the existing knowledge base is examined. Recent advances in how primary prevention is viewed are described, and some general issues not yet resolved are identified. In particular, the importance of the growing shift of interest from predisposing factors in emotional disorders to precipitating factors, and the shift from the search for disorder-specific causes to the search for general, nonspecific causes is underlined.","Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) has gained increasing interest as a vulnerability factor for worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and other emotional disorders. We extended the procedure of Grupe and Nitschke (2011) to compare threat processing in High IU (n=29) and Low IU (n=26) participants. Participants viewed four cues: two reference cues that preceded aversive pictures on 100% or 0% of trials, and a target cue that preceded aversive pictures on 50% of trials (Uncertain condition). Participants were instructed about these probabilities in advance. In addition, we surprised participants with a second target cue that also preceded aversive pictures on 50% of trials but that had not been mentioned in the instructions (Ambiguous condition). Results provided preliminary evidence that High IU participants showed greater online threat expectancy, postexperimental covariation estimates and negative mood for the target cues compared to the reference cues. The results also suggest that among high IU individuals, ambiguity, rather than uncertainty per se, may be a particularly powerful trigger for biased threat appraisal and negative affect. Clinically, the results suggest that patients with high IU may benefit from interventions to help them calibrate the degree of risk in situations involving ambiguous threat. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" appears to refer broadly to psychological or psychiatric conditions affecting emotion regulation and mood. In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" are discussed in the context of primary prevention, indicating a conceptual understanding of these conditions as relating to predisposing and precipitating factors. Moving to Text B, while there is a specific focus on Generalized Anxiety Disorder and the role of ""Intolerance of Uncertainty"" within the context of emotional disorders, the core usage remains consistent. The term still encompasses conditions that alter emotional processing and regulation. Despite variations in specific constructs or subtopics (like focusing on general versus specific causes or discussing vulnerability factors in anxiety), the fundamental meaning pertaining to disorders of emotional nature remains stable between the texts. Hence, the usage of ""emotional disorders"" has remained unchanged in terms of its essential meaning."
66,Emotional disorders,"The practitioner plays a key role in the primary and secondary prevention of stroke. For the treatment of an acute stroke immediate transfer to a specialized stroke unit is mandatory, while secondary prevention is oriented to the etiology of stroke. The risk factors need to be controlled more stringently than is the case for primary prevention. To ensure the appropriate organization of subsequent care, knowledge of the impairment profile and the support needed by the patient is obligatory. Apart from aiding social integration and providing medical treatment, the general physician also has the task of supporting the patient and, where necessary, treating emotional disorders. The rigorous treatment of secondary complications, or the reinstitution of rehabilitation measures to minimize functional impairments are tasks that can only be performed by the general practitioner.","Transdiagnostic treatments have been designed to target common processes for clusters of disorders. One such treatment, transdiagnostic behavior therapy (TBT), targets avoidance across emotional disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders, and has demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials. The current study was designed to examine whether distinct treatment trajectories would emerge in a sample of 112 veterans receiving TBT and whether diagnostic comorbidity, baseline levels of several transdiagnostic risk factors, or treatment engagement influence trajectory membership. Growth mixture modeling revealed three distinct trajectories across depression, ds = 0.55-1.09; PTSD ds = -0.07-1.43; and panic disorder symptoms, ds = -0.13-1.09. Notably, for PTSD and panic disorder symptoms, separate classes for responders and nonresponders emerged among participants with high baseline symptom levels. Findings for the risk factors suggested that PTSD and panic nonresponders evidenced significantly higher behavioral avoidance at baseline and reduced engagement in treatment procedures and homework completion compared to responders. Together, the findings provide additional support for the use of TBT in the treatment of emotional disorders, including PTSD. Potential adaptations are discussed for patients with significantly elevated behavioral avoidance to improve treatment engagement and related outcomes.","###Answer:

- Reason: In Text A, the phrase ""emotional disorders"" refers broadly to the mental health conditions that might need to be addressed by a general physician in the context of treating a patient recovering from a stroke. The term is used in a general sense, implying traditional management of these disorders alongside physical health management.

  In contrast, Text B discusses ""emotional disorders"" in a much more specialized and precise context, focusing heavily on the concept of transdiagnostic treatments that target common cognitive and behavioral processes underlying various specific disorders like PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The approach is more targeted and systemic, recognizing the interconnectivity of various disorders under the umbrella of ""emotional disorders"" and deploying specialized therapies that address their commonalities.

  This shift from a generic to a more analytical and targeted approach in addressing ""emotional disorders"" reflects a semantic drift in the professional medical understanding and treatment practices over the years, indicating not just a change in the techniques used but also in the theoretical understanding of these disorders."
67,Emotional disorders,"With the development of cognitive-behavioral theories and treatments for the emotional disorders, there is an increased need for the development and utilization of assessment devices to quantify cognitive constructs. This is especially important in the study and treatment of social phobia, an anxiety disorder that appears to have a significant cognitive component. In this paper, I review and evaluate the use of cognitive assessment strategies in studies of the cognitive-behavioral treatment of social phobia. Although much useful data have been collected, studies that included any form of cognitive assessment relied heavily on questionnaire assessment of fear of negative evaluation or irrational beliefs, with only occasional use of other methods such as thought listing or self-statement questionnaires. In the latter part of the review, I focus on the potential utility of other measures including those derived from the growing literature on the processing of information among persons with social phobia or other anxiety disorders. Studies that have demonstrated differences between social phobics and comparison groups are reviewed, and the potential uses of these information processing techniques are examined. The cognitive assessment of social phobia and its response to cognitive-behavioral interventions remains in its childhood, although the transition to adolescence may be on the horizon.","Unified protocol (UP) is a transdiagnostic cognitive behavior therapy for emotional disorders. It remains unknown whether UP is applicable for use in non-Western countries and for depressive disorders. We therefore examined its feasibility for a Japanese clinical population using this clinical trial design, which is multicentered, open-labeled, and single-armed (Clinical registry: UMIN000008322). The primary outcome was severity of anxiety symptoms, as assessed using Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, clinical global impression, functioning, quality of life, affectivity, emotion regulation, and adverse events. Of the 28 prospective participants, 17 were eligible and enrolled (depressive disorders=9, anxiety disorders=8). Severity of anxiety symptoms, which decreased significantly after the intervention, remained low for 3months (Hedges' g=1.29, 95% CI=0.56-2.06). Similar tendencies were observed for secondary outcome measures. No severe adverse event occurred. Two participants dropped out of the intervention. High treatment adherence and interrater reliability were confirmed. Results suggest the feasibility of UP in the Japanese context sufficient to warrant a larger clinical trial.","###Answer:

68,Emotional disorders,"On the basis of clinical and experimental studies of 83 patients with primary arterial hypotension, the authors present characteristic features of its clinical manifestations related to genetic predisposition and the effect of exogenous factors. Emotional, vegetative, hemodynamic and cerebral disorders associated with the clinical form of disease, namely with the presence or absence of syncopes in the picture of disease are analyzed. Characteristics of psychovegetative disturbances and also of the EEG pattern in various emotional disorders are offered. The results obtained seem to suggest the involvement of cerebral systems in the disruption of hemodynamic mechanisms in arterial hypotension.","Children worldwide experience mental and emotional disorders. Mental disorders occurring among young children, especially infants (birth -3 years), often go unrecognized. Prevalence rates are difficult to determine because of lack of awareness and difficulty assessing and diagnosing young children. Existing data, however, suggest that rates of disorders in young children are comparable to those of older children and adolescents (von Klitzing, Dohnert, Kroll, & Grube, ). The lack of widespread recognition of disorders of infancy is particularly concerning due to the unique positioning of infancy as foundational in the developmental process. Both the brain and behavior are in vulnerable states of development across the first 3 years of life, with potential for enduring deviations to occur in response to early trauma and deprivation. Intervention approaches for young children require sensitivity to their developmental needs within their families. The primacy of infancy as a time of unique foundational risks for disorder, the impact of trauma and violence on young children's development, the impact of family disruption on children's attachment, and existing literature on prevalence rates of early disorders are discussed. Finally, global priorities for addressing these disorders of infancy are highlighted to support prevention and intervention actions that may alleviate suffering among our youngest world citizens.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" refers specifically to disruptions in emotional stability linked with physiological and hemodynamic conditions such as arterial hypotension. The discussion is centered on physiological and neuropsychiatric assessments highlighting the interaction between cerebral systems and emotional stability that influences physical health conditions. This presents emotional disorders in a more clinical and pathological context, directly linked to specific physical health scenarios.

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" broadens greatly in meaning, referring to a range of mental health issues in young children, from infancy through early childhood, implying a much more general approach to psychological and developmental problems. This context refers to the disorders as they relate to developmental stages and the potential for long-term impact due to early life experiences and trauma. Here, emotional disorders encompass a broader spectrum of mental health concerns beyond a strict physiological interaction, highlighting developmental, emotional, and psychological aspects across a critical period of growth in early life.

The semantic drift evident from Text A to Text B shows a transition from a specific clinical manifestation of emotional disorders linked directly with other bodily systems and disturbances to a wider, more generalized interpretation concerning psychological development and mental health in a vulnerable age group. Thus, the meaning and application of ""emotional disorders"" has expanded and shifted in focus over time, reflecting a change in understanding and societal focus on mental health."
69,Emotional disorders,"""Presence,"" as discussed in the virtual reality (VR) literature, is the sense of truly being in a virtual place. This literature explores many aspects of presence including interactive and environmental factors. This exploration has generally ignored the impact of the individual's mental status on the experience of presence. Mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis may each define a population with specific tendencies to respond to VR in particular ways. To fully understand the experience of presence in virtual environments, we must understand more about the impact of different mental states on presence. Such an understanding will improve our insight into the construct of presence, assist in improved design of virtual environments, and better inform us about how virtual environments can be applied in the treatment of emotional disorders.","Tinnitus is a common symptom largely impactful on quality of life, especially in the elderly. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of self-administered screening tests to correlate the severity of subjective perception of tinnitus with emotional disorders and the overall cognitive status.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used within a medical or therapeutic context related to health and well-being. 

In Text A, the discussion revolves around the impact of various mental disorders (like depression, anxiety, and psychosis) on the experience of presence in virtual environments, and considers how understanding these impacts can assist in treating emotional disorders. The term is used broadly to encompass various forms of mental health issues that affect emotions and includes discussions about their treatment within virtual reality settings.

In Text B, the focus is on understanding how the severity of tinnitus correlates with emotional disorders and cognitive status in individuals. Here, emotional disorders are linked with the subjective perception of a health condition (tinnitus) and its impact on quality of life, indicating ongoing concern with how these disorders can affect and be affected by physical health conditions.

In both cases, ""emotional disorders"" refer to conditions involving emotional dysregulation or disturbances that might require medical or psychological intervention, not straying significantly in usage between the texts from different periods. Thus, no notable semantic drift is observed for the term ""emotional disorders"" in the contexts provided."
70,Emotional disorders,"A diagnostic dilemma exists when clinicians face patients with atypical recurrent symptoms involving both physical and psychologic elements. Multiple sclerosis (MS) represents such a dilemma. Few authors address themselves to the significance of depressive illness as the initial presentation in MS. Three patients hospitalized solely due to recurrent emotional disorders are described. Depressive symptoms predominated. In each case no precipitant for depression was identified, no previous neurologic diagnosis was entertained by clinician or patient, and multiple prior psychotherapeutic interventions were unsuccessful. The episodic nature of the symptoms and poor response to usually effective treatments created a high index of suspicion for central nervous system disease. A diagnosis of MS was made based on subtle neurologic signs, spinal fluid gamma globulin elevations, and abnormalities in neuropsychological testing. Treatment involved integrated psychiatric and medical measures.","Emotional disorders and cognitive dysfunctions are important treatment targets in psychiatric clinical settings. The biological mechanisms of emotional disorders have been studied with methods that include fear conditioning, schizophrenia models are studied with methamphetamine-induced reverse tolerance in rats, and dynamic changes in brain neurotransmitters are studied with microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography. We combined these methods in order to evaluate dopamine dynamics in the amygdala and the biological bases and relationships of emotional disorder and cognitive dysfunction. Fear-conditioned rats showed freezing behavior and dopamine release in the amygdala in response to conditioned stimuli. Methamphetamine-induced reverse tolerance rats showed increased dopamine release in the amygdala in response to conditioned stimuli. The increased release of dopamine continued after the freezing behavior had ended. This increased and long-lasting dopamine release may reflect abnormal emotional context processing in cognition in schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, aripiprazole, and clozapine, suppress this increased release of dopamine in the amygdala in response to conditioned stimuli. These findings suggest that antipsychotic drugs may stabilize abnormal emotional context processing in cognition in this model. We conclude that the significance of pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia is that antipsychotic drugs stabilize the emotional context processing in cognition and adjust the relationship of emotion and cognition.","- Label: Changed
- Reason:
In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" primarily refers to a group of symptoms predominantly comprising depressive signs, occurring in the context of another medical condition (multiple sclerosis) which can mimic or precipitate such disorders. The focus here is on the presentation of emotional conditions as confusing symptoms that eventually lead to a different medical diagnosis, emphasizing the complexity and challenge in diagnosis due to overlapping symptoms.

In Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is expanded to include detailed biological mechanisms and their study within psychiatric research and treatment settings. Here, the focus is on the fundamental biological underpinnings and the effects of pharmaceutical treatments on these conditions, using advanced scientific methodologies like fear conditioning and biogenic amine analysis in lab models. The usage in Text B demonstrates a shift towards a more technical and biomedical understanding of emotional disorders, including how they interact with cognitive functions and are influenced by pharmacotherapy.

Thus, between the two texts, ""emotional disorders"" shifts from being seen as complex symptoms that may lead to medical misdiagnosis, towards a deeper, scientifically rooted exploration of their biological basis and treatment in psychiatric practice. This highlights a semantic drift in the term's usage from a more general, clinical descriptor to a specific, research-focused term intertwined with neuroscience and pharmacology."
71,Emotional disorders,"The reliability and validity of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) were evaluated in a sample of 556 German primary school children. Both the SCAS (alpha = 0.92) and the SCARED (alpha = 0.91) were demonstrated to have high internal consistency. The validity of the SCAS and the SCARED was supported by a number of findings. First, in agreement with previous studies, girls displayed significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms than boys. Furthermore, SCAS and SCARED scores were substantially interrelated. Finally, significant correlations were found between these two measures of anxiety symptoms and the Youth Self-Report and the Columbia Impairment Scale. The utility of the SCAS and the SCARED as screening instruments for anxiety symptoms in children is briefly discussed.","Understanding the autonomic nervous system and homeostatic changes associated with emotions remains a major challenge for neuroscientists and a fundamental prerequisite to treat anxiety, stress, and emotional disorders. Based on recent publications, the inter-relationship between respiration and emotions and the influence of respiration on autonomic changes, and subsequent widespread membrane potential changes resulting from changes in homeostasis are discussed. We hypothesize that reversing homeostatic alterations with meditation and breathing techniques rather than targeting neurotransmitters with medication may be a superior method to address the whole body changes that occur in stress, anxiety, and depression. Detrimental effects of stress, negative emotions, and sympathetic dominance of the autonomic nervous system have been shown to be counteracted by different forms of meditation, relaxation, and breathing techniques. We propose that these breathing techniques could be used as first-line and supplemental treatments for stress, anxiety, depression, and some emotional disorders. ","### Label: Changed

### Reason:
In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is mentioned in the context of anxiety symptoms in children, particularly assessing the scales used for screening anxiety-related symptoms in a school environment. The discussion mainly centers around anxiety as a specific type of emotional disorder, evaluated with standardized tools.

In contrast, Text B expands on the concept of emotional disorders far beyond just measuring symptoms or using traditional medical treatments. It discusses systemic and holistic approaches involving the autonomic nervous system, stressing the impacts of meditation, breathing techniques, and managing homeostasis on emotional disorders. Here, ""emotional disorders"" include a broader range of conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and integrate physiological, psychological, and alternative medicine perspectives.

This shift suggests a notable expansion in the conceptualization of ""emotional disorders"" from primarily focusing on symptom measurement in clinical psychology to embracing a more integrative and holistic approach that includes physiological interconnections and non-pharmacological interventions."
72,Emotional disorders,"This study investigates the extent to which 2 Hand Test variables, the Pathology summary score (PATH) and the Acting Out Score (AOS), were able to differentiate among 3 groups of adolescents. Thirty psychiatric inpatient adolescents diagnosed with various Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) behavioral and emotional disorders were compared to 30 outpatient and 30 nonclinical adolescents matched on age, grade, and sex. An analysis of variance demonstrated the ability of both PATH and AOS to significantly differentiate among the 3 groups. Multiple regression equations utilized PATH and AOS as significant predictors of inpatient status (p < .0001) and general patient (inpatient and outpatient) status (p < .0001). Utilizing diagnostic efficiency statistics, overall correct classification was found to be highest for PATH > or = 3 and AOS > or = 2. These findings support the application of the Hand Test as a useful assessment tool for adolescents suspected of having psychiatric disorders and present evidence for the use of PATH and AOS for classification purposes in ways that are clinically meaningful.","  Congenital amusia is a neuro-developmental disorder of music perception and
production, with the observed deficits contrasting with the sophisticated music
processing reported for the general population. Musical deficits within amusia
have been hypothesized to arise from altered pitch processing, with impairments
in pitch discrimination and, notably, short-term memory. We here review
research investigating its behavioral and neural correlates, in particular the
impairments at encoding, retention, and recollection of pitch information, as
well as how these impairments extend to the processing of pitch cues in speech
and emotion. The impairments have been related to altered brain responses in a
distributed fronto-temporal network, which can be observed also at rest.
Neuroimaging studies revealed changes in connectivity patterns within this
network and beyond, shedding light on the brain dynamics underlying auditory
cognition. Interestingly, some studies revealed spared implicit pitch
processing in congenital amusia, showing the power of implicit cognition in the
music domain. Building on these findings, together with audiovisual integration
and other beneficial mechanisms, we outline perspectives for training and
rehabilitation and the future directions of this research domain.
","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used in a clinical and diagnostic context referring to a broad category of psychiatric conditions affecting adolescents' behavior and emotional state. The focus is on specific diagnosis and differentiation among groups defined by patient status (inpatient, outpatient, nonclinical). This reflects a traditional, broad application of the term within psychological and psychiatric assessment frameworks.

However, in Text B, while ""emotional disorders"" is not directly mentioned, the understanding and context of emotional processing, particularly in relation to pitch perception in congenital amusia, reflect a more nuanced understanding of how specific cognitive and neural mechanisms relate to emotion. Here, the discussion focuses on specific neural correlates and deficits that have broader implications on emotional perception and cognition, suggesting a shift towards a more detailed, neurologically-oriented interpretation of how 'emotional disorders' or conditions could be understood in modern research settings.

This indicates a semantic drift from a broader, somewhat generic use of ""emotional disorders"" as broad psychiatric categories to a more specific, mechanism-based perspective that considers detailed neural and cognitive processes underlying emotional disturbances or disorders."
73,Emotional disorders,"Eighty child psychiatric inpatients with behavioral and emotional disorders were evaluated from multiple perspectives on admission and at 5-month and 3-year follow-ups. A majority of the patients showed a significant improvement in functioning during the 3-year follow-up. About half of the patients were functioning within clinical range at 3-year follow-up on parental (CBCL) and/or teacher (TRF) ratings. A less favorable outcome was predicted by disruptive behavioral disorder, severity of initial dysfunction, high antisocial and hyperkinetic symptoms, adoptive household and postdischarge institutional placement. Pure anxiety or affective disorder was associated with favorable outcome. Age, sex, place of treatment, and length of hospital treatment were not related to outcome variables.","Alcohol consumption is spread worldwide and can lead to an abuse profile associated with severe health problems. Adolescents are more susceptible to addiction and usually consume ethanol in a binge drinking pattern. This form of consumption can lead to cognitive and emotional disorders, however scarce studies have focused on long-term hazardous effects following withdrawal periods after binge drinking in adolescents. Thus, the present study aims at investigating whether behavioral and cognitive changes persist until mid and late adulthood.

- Reason:
The term ""emotional disorders"" in both Text A and Text B refers to psychological impairments that significantly affect emotions and behavior, indicating a largely consistent use of the term over time. In Text A, the discussion centers around evaluating child psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with emotional disorders and tracking their functional outcomes over time relative to various conditions and prognostic factors. The focus here shows a clinical and longitudinal perspective towards treating and understanding emotional disorders.

In Text B, the context shifts somewhat to focus on the specific effects of alcohol consumption during adolescence and how it correlates to the emergence of cognitive and emotional disorders. Here, the term is used to illustrate the longer-term psychological effects induced by substance abuse. 

However, despite the different specific scenarios and contributing factors, the fundamental meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as conditions affecting mood, feeling, and emotional state remains consistent between the two texts. The focus remains on psychological implications and associated behaviors, indicating no significant semantic drift in the term's usage from a clinical psychological perspective to a context focused on substance-induced conditions."
74,Emotional disorders,"Androgens control a broad range of physiological functions. The androgen receptor (AR), a steroid receptor that mediates the diverse biological actions of androgens, is a ligand inducible transcription factor. Abnormalities in the androgen signaling system result in many disturbances ranging from changes in gender determination and sexual development to psychiatric and emotional disorders. Androgen replacement therapy can improve many clinical conditions including hypogonadism and osteoporosis, but is limited by the lack of efficacious and safe therapeutic agents with easy delivery options. Recent progress in the area of gene regulation by steroid receptors and by selective receptor modulators provides an opportunity to examine if selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) could address some of the problems associated with current androgen therapy. Since the composition of the transcriptional initiation complex recruited by liganded AR determines the specificity of gene regulation, synthetic ligands aimed at initiating transcription of tissue and promoter specific genes offers hope for developing better androgen therapy. Establishment of assays that predict synthetic ligand activity is critical for SARM development. Advancement in high throughput compound screening and gene fingerprinting technologies, such as microarrays and proteomics, will facilitate and accelerate identification of effective SARMs.","Most patients in community practice attend significantly fewer sessions than are recommended by treatment protocols that have demonstrated efficacy in addressing emotional disorders. Personalized interventions that target the core processes thought to maintain a wide range of disorders may serve to increase treatment efficiency, addressing this gap. This study sought to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the personalized delivery of a mechanistically transdiagnostic intervention, the Unified Protocol (UP) for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders. Using an AB phase change design in accordance with the single-case reporting guideline for behavioral interventions (SCRIBE), 18 individuals with heterogeneous emotional disorders were randomly assigned to receive UP treatment modules ordered according to either their pretreatment strengths or weaknesses. Results support the feasibility of reordering the treatment modules as the majority of patients presented with marked differences in skill levels, as well as the acceptability of this approach as patients in both conditions reported satisfaction with their assigned treatment order. Furthermore, the majority of patients demonstrated symptom improvement consistent with previously reported effects of the standard-order UP. Finally, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that those in the strengths condition displayed improvements in outcomes earlier in treatment than those in the weaknesses condition. Taken together, these findings offer preliminary support for improving treatment efficiency through the utilization of a personalized, strengths-based, transdiagnostic approach.","### Answer:

- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to refer to psychological or psychiatric conditions affecting emotions and behaviors. Text A discusses the influence of androgen signaling on various physiological functions including emotional disorders, indicating a biological perspective on such conditions. Text B involves the treatment and management of emotional disorders through a unified, transdiagnostic therapeutic approach, focusing on improving treatment efficiency and personalization. Both texts, although dealing with different aspects (biological mechanisms versus therapeutic approaches), perceive ""emotional disorders"" within the consistent framework of mental health conditions affecting emotional stability. Consequently, there is no significant semantic drift observed for the term ""emotional disorders"" between the two texts."
75,Emotional disorders,Diagnostic criteria for Personality Disorders and Adult Behavior according I.C.D.-10 are reviewed.

In the last years, online interventions were proliferated and the Attention Bias Modification (ABM) becoming a promising implicit therapeutic intervention based on attention deployment emotion-regulation strategy, or adjunctive module to usual treatments, with results in multiple domains, varying from pain to self-esteem and emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety). We conducted two studies to investigate (1) the efficacy of the ABM procedures applied to parents and (2) the efficacy of the online version of the rPPP augmented with an ABM module. A total of 42 parents of children aged 2-12 years old participated in the first study, being allocated either to the ABM training or wait-list. Positive results were reported by the parents participating in the ABM group for own distress, satisfaction, positive interactions with the child, and child's strengths. In the second study, 53 parents and their children were allocated either in the rPPP group or in the rPPP + ABM group. Results show that ABM training can boost the effects of the rPPP on the strengths of children reported by the parents after the intervention. Findings are discussed in the light of limited research on using online tools for coaching effective emotion-regulation strategies for parents.","###Label:

###Reason:
The usage and connotation of the term ""emotional disorders"" appears to have shifted between Text A and Text B. 

In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is included under a broader discussion of Personality Disorders, classified within a medical and diagnostic context related to adult behavior and differentiating subtypes like Borderline Disorders. The focus is clearly on clinical definitions and categorization within a professional healthcare setting.

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" are mentioned in the context of parenting and child behavior, with an emphasis on treatment programs that include emotional regulation strategies and attention bias modification to address issues like anxiety. Here, the term is used more in a psychological intervention perspective focusing on practical applications and therapeutic programs, moving beyond just a diagnostic label to include components of treatment and prevention.

The shift from a strictly clinical categorization to a more intervention-based application in different contexts (child behavior and parenting) indicates a semantic drift in how ""emotional disorders"" are understood and approached across the two texts."
76,Emotional disorders,"Among 103 persons aged 20 to 57 years, related occupationally to emotional stress, 48 persons were found to have vegetative dystonia, 28 initial manifestations of cerebral circulation failure, and 27 persons appeared healthy. The determination of the character and intensity of vegetative manifestations has shown that in the formation of vegetative dystonia, of paramount importance are cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders. Vegetative manifestations associated with initial manifestations of cerebral circulation failure include, in addition, respiratory disturbances and impairment of sleep function, which may reflect more deep changes in the activity of the regulatory apparatus in dyshemias of organic nature.

77,Emotional disorders,"There is an unmet need for a reliable method of evaluating disorders of mood and affect in developmentally disabled children and adolescents. Such a measure is required for both accurate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in this population. An extensive review of existing assessment techniques confirms that: (a) current techniques for the evaluation of emotional disorders in cognitively normal individuals are inappropriate for most children with developmental disabilities; and (b) current instruments designed for the assessment of developmentally disabled children pay inadequate attention to affective symptoms. In this paper, the preliminary version of a new instrument, the ""Emotional Disorders Rating Scale for Developmental Disabilities"" (EDRS-DD), designed to evaluate mood and affect in children and adolescents with developmental disabilities, is presented.

In Text B, the use of ""Emotional disorders"" is part of a broader discussion on automated emotion recognition technologies for assisting individuals with various health disorders affecting communication, such as muscle wasting, stroke, and autism. Here, the term moves beyond merely diagnosing or categorizing psychiatric conditions and instead is part of a technological application aimed at recognizing emotional states to provide real-time support or feedback.

This shift from a clinical-evaluation-focused use in Text A to a technological and interventional application in Text B demonstrates a significant change in the context and implications of the term, signifying a semantic drift towards broader applications involving technology and interactive support systems."

There can be no serious argument with this preventive ideal: the conditions on which health practitioners focus their professional attention are, with the sole exceptions of pregnancy and childbirth, theoretically unnecessary and--apart from the issue of ""secondary gain""--distinctly disadvantageous to those who develop them. This statement is as true of conditions which bring people to the offices of mental health practitioners as it is of conditions which bring them to physicians.

A sample of 144 adolescents [aged 12-18 years, 55 boys (38.2%) and 89 girls (61.8%)] most of whom showed elevated levels of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms completed several self-report measures online assessing coronavirus fears, transdiagnostic vulnerability and protective factors, and emotion regulation strategies. Results based on a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that coronavirus fears, negative affect, intolerance of uncertainty, acceptance/tolerance, rumination and suppression explained unique variance in the severity of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms. Path analysis demonstrated that acceptance/tolerance, rumination and suppression mediated the association between higher level transdiagnostic factors and the severity of major depressive disorder symptoms. Findings provide support for the hierarchical transdiagnostic model of emotional disorders and suggest that clinicians should be aware of coronavirus fears.

79,Emotional disorders,"Observational methods were used to determine whether depressive symptoms in 20 inpatients with major depressive disorder could be observed to change during the course of treatment with antidepressant medication. Four consecutive weekly observation sessions were done using the Emotional Disorders Rating Scale, which collects information about symptoms of depression, mania, anxiety, hostility, and irritability. Only those scales indexing depressive symptoms evidenced change. Significant change was observed between the third and fourth weeks of hospitalization, thereby replicating the findings reported in the adult literature regarding depressive symptoms' responsiveness to antidepressants.","  Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging approach for studies
and novel treatments of major depressive disorder (MDD). EEG performed
simultaneously with an rtfMRI-nf procedure allows an independent evaluation of
rtfMRI-nf brain modulation effects. Frontal EEG asymmetry in the alpha band is
a widely used measure of emotion and motivation that shows profound changes in
depression. However, it has never been directly related to simultaneously
acquired fMRI data. We report the first study investigating
electrophysiological correlates of the rtfMRI-nf procedure, by combining
rtfMRI-nf with simultaneous and passive EEG recordings. In this pilot study,
MDD patients in the experimental group (n=13) learned to upregulate BOLD
activity of the left amygdala using an rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion
induction task. MDD patients in the control group (n=11) were provided with a
sham rtfMRI-nf. Correlations between frontal EEG asymmetry in the upper alpha
band and BOLD activity across the brain were examined. Average individual
changes in frontal EEG asymmetry during the rtfMRI-nf task for the experimental
group showed a significant positive correlation with the MDD patients'
depression severity ratings, consistent with an inverse correlation between the
depression severity and frontal EEG asymmetry at rest. Temporal correlations
between frontal EEG asymmetry and BOLD activity were significantly enhanced,
during the rtfMRI-nf task, for the amygdala and many regions associated with
emotion regulation. Our findings demonstrate an important link between amygdala
BOLD activity and frontal EEG asymmetry. Our EEG asymmetry results suggest that
the rtfMRI-nf training targeting the amygdala is beneficial to MDD patients,
and that alpha-asymmetry EEG-nf would be compatible with the amygdala
rtfMRI-nf. Combination of the two could enhance emotion regulation training and
benefit MDD patients.

80,Emotional disorders,"This paper addresses child and adolescent psychopathology as it presents to general practitioners and paediatricians, and explores psychosocial aspects of unexplained medical symptoms in children and adolescents. High rates of psychopathology have been identified amongst children and adolescents attending general practice and paediatric services, most of it ''hidden'' at presentation and emotional in nature. It is often linked to poor physical well being and to maternal stress focused on the child. It may be of special relevance to medical help seeking in socio-economically advantaged areas. Co-morbid psychopathology, mainly emotional disorders, is common amongst children with unexplained medical symptoms. However, there are specific psychosocial aspects that differentiate these children from those with emotional disorders. They involve disease beliefs, illness behaviour and predicament. The latter may be characterised by special reactivity to stress in children with personality vulnerability, in a context of parents with high levels of mental distress, unexplained medical symptoms and emotional over-involvement with the child. There is comparatively little interface work between CAMHS and primary health care. An important research priority would seem to lie in the development of interventions that can be adapted for use by primary care staff. Similarly, there are few dedicated CAMHS paediatric liaison teams. Their more extensive development should help attend in a more informed and focused way than at present to children and adolescents suffering from unexplained physical symptoms and disorders. Further research is needed into vulnerability mechanisms and maintaining factors, health beliefs, treatment engagement and interventions.","Significant evidence does exist on the effectiveness of transdiagnostic interventions to improve emotional problems in clinical populations, and their application as universal and indicated prevention programs. However, no randomized controlled trials (RCT) studying selective transdiagnostic prevention intervention have been published.

Self- and parent-reported measures were taken at baseline, as well as after the intervention, a 6-month follow-up was carried out, together with a 1-month follow-up after the booster session. Differences between conditions were significant on most of the outcome measures, with superior effect sizes for PROCARE +. Interventions were excellent in terms of acceptability, with good satisfaction rates. Tailored selective transdiagnostic interventions focused on mitigating risk factors and promoting protective factors in vulnerable adolescents are promising.","- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to refer to psychological conditions that manifest primarily through emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression, impacting general well-being and functionality. In Text A, the focus is on identifying the prevalence and co-morbidity of emotional disorders among children and adolescents with unexplained medical symptoms. It discusses the impact of these disorders on physical health and the role of psychosocial factors. Text B, from a more recent perspective, discusses targeted interventions (transdiagnostic treatments) for adolescents at risk of developing emotional disorders, aiming at prevention and effective management. Despite the advancement in understanding and approach (from identification to proactive intervention), the core meaning of ""emotional disorders,"" referring to mental health issues expressed primarily through emotional instability, remains consistent across both texts."
81,Emotional disorders,"The treatment of insane persons in the last century is briefly described. A more liberal and unrestrained treatment was introduced at the turn of the century, and chiefly agriculturally oriented insane asylums were established at that time. The question of persons trained to care for subjects afflicted with insanity was increasingly gaining in importance, and the aim was to have available a pool of skilled nursing personnel. Treatment by inducing artificial fever is outlined in addition to a brief description of a more activ treatment of patients by the Simon-Gütersloh method. In 1925, a ""neuro-psychiatric dispensary"" was established in the Soviet Union. Later, there were introduced such methods as insulin shock treatment and electroconvulsive therapy and, more recently, treatment with psychopharmaceuticals, the latter being drugs used in the treatment of emotional disorders in modern psychiatric hospitals. Inpatient and outpatient treatment is further developed with the establishment of day/night hospitals, and the need is pointed out to develop a system of care for mental patients on the model of that which exists in the Soviet Union.","Aged care services increasingly respond to the needs of people with dementia. Non-pharmacological approaches are preferable to reduce responsive behaviours, improve/maintain functional capacity and reduce emotional disorders. This rapid review of systematic reviews aimed to consolidate the evidence for non-pharmacological interventions and determine outcome effectiveness.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" primarily refers to conditions that affect a person's mood, behavior, and overall emotional state, which results in difficulties in coping with life's ordinary demands and routines. Text A discusses the treatment methodologies and advancements for emotional disorders within a historical context, highlighting the progression from early harsh treatments to more modern approaches such as psychopharmaceuticals aimed at managing these conditions. Text B focuses on non-pharmacological interventions specifically tailored for dementia-related emotional disorders, still emphasizing treatment and management of conditions affecting emotional and psychological health. The core underlying meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as conditions impacting emotional stability remains consistent across both timeframes, focusing on behavioral and emotional dysregulation and their management, despite the advancements in specific treatments and contexts of application."
82,Emotional disorders,"At the age of 13 years, 60 adolescents, suffering from phenylalaninemia due to hydroxylase deficiency, and their mothers were simultaneously investigated with a standardized psychiatric interview in order to determine the adolescents' psychiatric status. Forty symptoms related to emotional disorders, antisocial and conduct disorders, hyperkinetic syndromes, and specific symptoms like psychophysiological pains, enuresis, encopresis, tics, stereotypies, and eating disorders were examined. Severity level was rated as undisturbed, mild, moderate, and severe disturbance. Comparison with a representative sample of 191 age mates revealed a double rate of moderate disturbances for the PKU sample. There was no association between severity level and sex as well as mean phenylalanine level during the first 13 years of the patients' lives. No PKU specific diagnosis could be determined. WISC-R-IQ below 90 was associated with a threefold risk of more severe disturbance and patients with more than three adverse familial circumstances had a 50% chance of getting a psychiatric diagnosis. It is concluded that the observed disturbances result from stress associated more with the chronic condition than with the increased phenylalanine level.","We provide a theoretical rationale for applying a transdiagnostic, shared mechanism treatment (the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders [UP]) to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We also present results from a proof of concept study examining the feasibility and acceptability of adding a modified UP to treatment as usual (TAU) in an inpatient setting for individuals reporting a recent suicide attempt or active suicidal ideation. Participants ( N = 12) were randomly assigned to receive UP + TAU or TAU alone. Findings indicate good feasibility and acceptability of the adjunctive intervention. Among participants who were responsive to contact attempts postdischarge ( n = 6), there were no observable differences in suicidal thoughts or behaviors during a 6-month follow-up. This application represents a promising initial extension of a cognitive-behavioral, emotion-focused treatment to suicidal individuals within an inpatient setting. Future studies adequately powered to speak to efficacy of the modified UP intervention are warranted.","###Answer:
- Target word: **Emotional disorders**
  
- **Text A**: This text discusses the emotional disorders in adolescents suffering from phenylketonuria (PKU), focusing on psychiatric evaluations and the prevalence of various disturbances such as antisocial behaviors and conduct disorders. The concept here strictly aligns with the psychological and psychiatric manifestations emerging from a chronic condition (PKU), highlighting the stress associated with managing a chronic disease.

- **Text B**: Here, emotional disorders are approached from a broader, treatment-focused perspective, involving the application of a transdiagnostic treatment method (Unified Protocol) for various emotional disorders. This includes treating conditions that potentially lead to severe consequences like suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The approach is integrative, aiming to address a wide range of emotional dysfunctions within a unified therapeutic model.

- **Label**: Changed
  
- **Reason**: The term ""emotional disorders"" has undergone semantic drift from being context-specific psychiatric disturbances associated with a particular medical condition (PKU in Text A) to a broader conceptualization as multiple affective disturbances treatable with a unified therapeutic approach (Text B). The shift from a specific focus to a more generalized, treatment-oriented application reflects a significant expansion in how the term is applied and understood."
83,Emotional disorders,"The clinical cognitive approach assumes that emotional reactions are mediated through the meanings given to events. Cognitive therapy aims to change emotion by changing meanings. It focuses on specific level meanings, evaluating the truth value of particular beliefs. Bower's science-driven associative network theory of cognition and emotion is also primarily concerned with specific meanings. This focus on meaning at a specific level causes problems, e.g. the contrasts between 'intellectual' and 'emotional' belief, between 'cold' and 'hot' cognition, and between explicit and intuitive knowledge. These problems are resolved in the Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) approach. ICS distinguishes between a specific and a more holistic, intuitive, level of meaning. In contrast to alternative approaches, ICS suggest that holistic level meanings are of primary importance in emotion production. Representations at this level consist of schematic mental models, encoding high-order inter-relationships and prototypical patterns extracted from life experience. The ICS approach to meaning is described and its implications for understanding and treating emotional disorders discussed, together with relevant empirical findings. ICS suggests a therapeutic focus on holistic rather than specific meanings, a role for 'non-evidential' interventions, such as guided imagery, and a rational basis for certain experiential therapies.","We aimed to assess the prevalence (at three levels of severity) and other epidemiological data of OCD in a sample of 1,514 Spanish non-referred children. The estimated prevalence was 1.8% for OCD, 5.5% for subclinical OCD and 4.7% for OC symptomatology. We did not find significant differences between genders or academic grade regarding OC symptoms and OCD, but more subclinical prevalence was found in males than in females. Socio-demographic variables were not related to any level of OCD, but academic performance was significantly lower in clinical OCD. The co-morbidity between OCD and any psychiatric disorder was high (85%) and higher for emotional disorders than for behavioral disorders. The impairment was associated with comorbidity and was worse for OCD with comorbid emotional problems. The results suggest that OCD is not rare in school children and adolescents and that it has an impact on their personal functioning. We suggest the possibility of an early diagnosis and treatment.","###Answer:
- Target word: Emotional disorders
- **Text A**: Discusses the cognitive basis and therapeutic approaches to emotional disorders from a psychological theoretical viewpoint, explaining how emotional disorders are understood in the context of cognitive meanings and therapy.
- **Text B**: Presents clinical findings related to the epidemiology of OCD and its comorbidity with emotional disorders, focussing on their prevalence and impact on functionality, particularly in a sample of children.

- **Label**: Unchanged
- **Reason**: Despite the different disciplinary approaches (theoretical in Text A and clinical/epidemiological in Text B), the core concept of ""emotional disorders"" in both texts pertains to psychological conditions that affect mood, behavior, and cognitive function. Both texts consistently use the term to refer to a range of psychological problems or impairments tied to emotional dysregulation or disturbances. Therefore, there isn't substantial evidence of semantic drift concerning the fundamental meaning of ""emotional disorders"" between the two texts."
84,Emotional disorders,"Depressive symptoms are common in the elderly, and depressive illness is the most common of emotional disorders in those of advanced age. This article focuses on the use of antidepressant drugs for the treatment of older depressed patients. To correctly understand the use of antidepressant drugs, it is necessary to first appreciate the medical, neurobiologic, and pharmacologic context within which antidepressant drugs are to be prescribed. Therefore, this article also includes a brief review of the etiology and diagnosis of depression in the elderly.","Emotional competence, emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance have all been strongly associated to emotional disorders and psychological well-being in multiple studies. However little research has compared the unique predictive ability of these different constructs. We hypothesised that they will all share a large proportion of common variance and that when compared to the broader constructs emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness, acceptance alone would predict a larger proportion of unique variance METHODS: 228 participants from a community sample completed anonymously measures of anxiety, depression, happiness, acceptance, mindfulness, emotional competence and emotion regulation. We then ran multiple regressions to assess and compare the predictive ability of these different constructs.","- **Label:** Changed

- **Reason:** In Text A, ""emotional disorders"" is used primarily in the context of emphasizing depressive illness as a prevalent mental condition in the elderly, highlighting its clinical treatment with antidepressants. The usage here is narrow and specifically tied to a medical/clinical diagnosis and treatment scenario, focusing on depression. In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is discussed in a broader, more psychological and holistic context involving concepts like emotional competence, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and acceptance. It encompasses a wider view of mental health, indicating a shift to a focus on a broader range of psychological and emotional well-being issues and their management through various psychological constructs beyond just clinical treatments. Thus, the semantic usage of ""emotional disorders"" has shifted significantly towards a more inclusive and diversified understanding of psychological conditions between the two texts, representing a move from just clinical diagnosis to a broader, integrative perspective on emotional health."
85,Emotional disorders,"The relationship between lesion location and neuropsychiatric sequelae in stroke patients has been extensively studied. Emotional disorders associated with right hemisphere stroke include depression, anxiety, anger, and/or mania. Pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and/or psychotherapy are common treatments for these disorders. This article reviews the clinical presentations of seven right hemisphere stroke patients. The treatment rationale and course of treatment are described for two of these patients. The aims of this paper are to explore the appropriateness of various assessment tools and treatment modalities for stroke patients as well as to demonstrate the techniques of psychotherapy as applied to the two cases featured in this article. Specific factors that may significantly influence treatment outcome, such as lesion location and degree of cognitive impairment, are considered.","Early life experiences and genetic background shape phenotypic variation. Several mouse models based on early treatments have evaluated short- and long-term phenotypic alterations and explored their molecular mechanisms. The instability of maternal cues was used to model human separation anxiety in outbred mice, one of the etiopathogenetic factors that predict panic disorder (PD). Application of the repeated cross-fostering (RCF) protocol to inbred strains (C57 and DBA) allowed us to measure differential responses to the same experimental manipulation. Ultrasounds emitted during isolation indicated that after RCF, pups from both strains lose their ability to be comforted by nest cues, but the frequency modulation of separation calls increased in RCF-C57 and decreased in RCF-DBA mice. No strain-specific difference in olfactory ability explained these responses in RCF-exposed mice. Rather, disruption of the infant-mother bond may differentially affect separation calls in the two strains. Moreover, the RCF-associated increased respiratory response to hypercapnia-an endophenotype of human PD documented among mice outbred strains-was replicated in the C57 strain only. We suggest that RCF-induced instability of the early environment affects emotionality and respiratory physiology differentially, depending on pups' genetic background. These strain-specific responses provide a lead to understand differential vulnerability to emotional disorders.","### Answer:
- Target word: Emotional disorders
- Text A: Discusses the emotional disorders associated with right hemisphere strokes in humans, focusing on clinical manifestations like depression, anxiety, anger, and mania, as well as treatment options like pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and psychotherapy.
- Text B: Describes experiments on mice, focusing on the impact of early environmental instability and genetic factors on the development of emotional disorders like panic disorder. It delves into how different treatments and maternal separation affect mice's emotional responses, highlighting physiological and behavioral impacts.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to a range of psychological conditions affecting mood and affect, encompassing similar manifestations such as anxiety and problematic emotional responses. Despite differences in subject (humans vs. mice) and focus (clinical treatment vs. experimental manipulation), the underlying concept and categorization of ""emotional disorders"" as perturbations in normal emotional processing remain consistent across both contexts. Thus, the semantic use of ""emotional disorders"" has not undergone significant drift; it maintains a similar general meaning related to psychological health in both texts."
86,Emotional disorders,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are relatively common neurological disorders. Both disorders are chronic and progressive, produce varying degrees of physical disability, and result in characteristic neuropathological changes to a variety of subcortical brain structures. Patients with MS or PD also exhibit a higher prevalence of emotional disorders relative to other patient groups with comparable degrees of physical disability. The present review (a) examines specific methodological issues associated with research in this area, (b) describes the range and severity of emotional disorders in MS and PD, and (c) examines both endogenous and reactive explanations to account for the increased prevalence of emotional dysfunction in these two disorders. Suggestions for future research are offered, as well as implications for treatment.",Low recognition and intervention rates of emotional disorders among nonpsychiatric clinical patients are primarily attributable to poor mental health awareness of patients and a paucity of mental health care resources.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" consistently refers to mental health conditions characterized by significant disturbances in emotion or mood affecting the individual's well-being. Text A discusses emotional disorders in the context of neurological diseases (MS and PD), highlighting their prevalence and impact, whereas Text B addresses the problem of inadequate recognition and intervention in nonpsychiatric settings. Despite the different contexts of discussion (neurological vs. general healthcare setup), the fundamental meaning and connotation of ""emotional disorders"" remain the same — conditions that disrupt emotional stability and require attention and treatment. Thus, there's no significant semantic drift in the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" between the two time periods evidenced by the texts."
87,Emotional disorders,"Monoamine oxidase is an iron containing enzyme that exists as 2 isozymes, A and B, that have different affinities for various amines as substrates. The activity of monoamine oxidase helps to maintain neuron firing rates throughout the body within homeostatic limits. It does this by metabolizing in the liver bioactive amines absorbed into the bloodstream from food, by metabolizing in the endothelial cells of cerebral vascular microvessels, as part of the blood brain barrier, bioactive amines in the bloodstream, and by metabolizing in the cytoplasm of neurons, molecules of biogenic amine neurotransmitters that are not enclosed in vesicles. Part of the biochemical activity of monoamine oxidase generates hydroxyl radicals, very toxic members of the oxygen free radical group, that may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Inhibiting monoamine oxidase with selegiline (1-deprenyl) seems to have neuroprotective actions but this may be due to inducing the release of neuronal growth factors rather than by preventing the formation of free radicals. Other drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase are used to treat patients with atypical depression, panic attacks or post traumatic stress syndrome. It is hypothesized that the emotions act as positive or negative reinforcers of behavior patterns that increase the probability of survival of the organism. The original releasing stimuli for the emotions are related to the basic survival reflexes of the hypothalamus but the emotional response can be easily conditioned to formerly neutral stimuli by association. In the absence of the original releasing stimuli, these learned emotions increase the frequency of survival oriented behavior and decrease the frequency of behavior that jeopardizes survival. The emotional disorders are conditions in which the brain's reinforcement system is inoperative, the person loses contact with reality and the person's behavior bears no relationship to survival. Aversive stimulation evokes a negative emotional response that motivates the organism to escape from the aversive stimulation, and to avoid it, and any conditioned stimuli associated it, in the future. When the aversive stimulation and to avoid it, and any conditioned stimuli When the aversive stimulation is inescapable or unavoidable, the organism experiences stress. When the stressful aversive situation is not lethal, survival does not depend on escape but rather on conservation of energy. With repeated exposure, the negative emotional response to the aversive stimulation extinguishes, the organism adapts to the situation and takes on a passive, energy saving behavior pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","The aim of the research is the assessment of the features of the course of endometriosis in women in perimenopause.

###Reason:
In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to neurological conditions including depression, PTSD, and panic attacks that are intricately tied to neurochemical imbalances and physiological reactions in the brain. The text discusses these conditions in a clinical and biochemical context, eluding to them mostly as neurodegenerative issues that influence behavior related to survival. 

In Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe the psychological side-effects associated with a physical condition (endometriosis) during a specific life period (perimenopause). The term is rooted more in the psychological and symptomatic expression related to hormonal and life changes rather than biochemical neurodegeneration. 

The usage of ""emotional disorders"" has expanded and shifted from a strictly clinical context dealing with survival and response mechanisms of the brain, as seen in Text A, to encompassing psychological and mood disturbances caused by chronic health conditions and life phases, illustrated in Text B. This indicates a broadening of the term to include a wider variety of mental health issues not strictly tied to neurodegenerative conditions or primary psychiatric disorders but also linked to other health conditions and life events."
88,Emotional disorders,"President Clinton's proposal for a health care system based on managed competition began a dialogue within the mental health community about whether such a system would work in the mental health area. In early March a large coalition representing more than 30 mental health organizations, including advocacy organizations, state systems, professional associations, provider agencies, families, and consumers, formally transmitted to the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform a document presenting a unified position on how mental health care should be delivered within a reformed health care system. The consensus document, reproduced here, maintains that a full range of services must be available to all children and adults with mental or emotional disorders. The document presents guidelines for containing costs, for standards of delivery for mental health services, and for the role of the states and the federal government within the new health care system.","Neurons are particularly susceptible to energy fluctuations in response to stress. Mitochondrial fission is highly regulated to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation; however, the role of a regulator of mitochondrial fission in neuronal energy metabolism and synaptic efficacy under chronic stress remains elusive. Here, we show that chronic stress promotes mitochondrial fission in the medial prefrontal cortex via activating dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction in male mice. Both pharmacological inhibition and genetic reduction of Drp1 ameliorates the deficit of excitatory synaptic transmission and stress-related depressive-like behavior. In addition, enhancing Drp1 fission promotes stress susceptibility, which is alleviated by coenzyme Q10, which potentiates mitochondrial ATP production. Together, our findings unmask the role of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in the deficits of neuronal metabolic burden and depressive-like behavior and provides medication basis for metabolism-related emotional disorders.","Label: Changed

Reason: In Text A, the phrase ""emotional disorders"" is used in a broad medical and social context, referring to a range of conditions that affect emotional health and require a comprehensive system of care. The document suggests a systemic approach to mental health services, including standards, cost management, and regulatory roles, implying a collective term encompassing all disorders of emotional nature. In Text B, the focus shifts to a more specific and detailed scientific examination of ""emotional disorders"" within the context of chronic stress affecting neuronal function and mitochondrial activity. Here, ""emotional disorders"" are directly linked to physiological processes and metabolic dysfunction in brain structures that influence mood and behavior significantly. This represents a narrower, more focused usage related to neurological pathways and biochemistry, rather than a broad categorization of mental health issues. Thus, the term has drifted from a general reference to mental health conditions affecting emotional well-being to a specific focus on how biological functions and stress response are integral to these disorders. This shift in focus signifies a semantic evolution towards more specific scientific underpinnings of emotional disorders."
89,Emotional disorders,"Within an interdisciplinary research project, the long-term outcome of children with fetal alcohol syndrome was studied. Methods for the assessment of psychopathology, behavior, and intelligence included psychiatric interviews, behavior checklists for parents and teachers, and intelligence tests. The children were assessed during preschool age, early school age (6 to 12 years), and late school age (> or =13 years). An excess of psychopathology, (including hyperkinetic disorders, emotional disorders, sleep disorders, and abnormal habits and stereotypes) with a strong persistence over time was found. Cognitive functioning was marked by a large proportion of mentally retarded children and also did not change considerably over time. This long-term outcome study reflects the handicapping effects of fetal alcohol syndrome.","Stroke is one of the major causes of disability and mortality worldwide. It is well known that ischemic stroke can cause gray matter injury. However, stroke also elicits profound white matter injury, a risk factor for higher stroke incidence and poor neurological outcomes. The majority of damage caused by stroke is located in subcortical regions and, remarkably, white matter occupies nearly half of the average infarct volume. Indeed, white matter is exquisitely vulnerable to ischemia and is often injured more severely than gray matter. Clinical symptoms related to white matter injury include cognitive dysfunction, emotional disorders, sensorimotor impairments, as well as urinary incontinence and pain, all of which are closely associated with destruction and remodeling of white matter connectivity. White matter injury can be noninvasively detected by MRI, which provides a three-dimensional assessment of its morphology, metabolism, and function. There is an urgent need for novel white matter therapies, as currently available strategies are limited to preclinical animal studies. Optimal protection against ischemic stroke will need to encompass the fortification of both gray and white matter. In this review, we discuss white matter injury after ischemic stroke, focusing on clinical features and tools, such as imaging, manifestation, and potential treatments. We also briefly discuss the pathophysiology of WMI and future research directions.","### Label:

### Reason:
In both Text A (related to fetal alcohol syndrome) and Text B (focusing on stroke), the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe a category of psychological afflictions that impact emotional regulation and stability, manifesting as part of broader pathological conditions. In Text A, emotional disorders are listed among various other lasting psychopathologies caused by fetal alcohol syndrome in children. In Text B, emotional disorders are portrayed as clinical symptoms arising from white matter injury due to stroke, affecting emotional functions alongside other neurological impairments. 

The context around the usage of the term in both texts suggests a consistent understanding and application of ""emotional disorders"" as disorders affecting emotional well-being and functioning, though associated with different medical conditions. There's no indication of a change in the semantic meaning of ""emotional disorders"" between the two texts, despite the varied medical contexts. Thus, the term has remained unchanged in meaning across the time span covered by the provided texts."
90,Emotional disorders,"Long-term home oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival of hypoxic patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency. However, the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of these patients, when LTOT is initiated, is severely impaired. The present study aims to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients under LTOT, assessed at home, to identify parameters relevant to HRQL, and to describe changes over a 1-yr period. Seventy-nine patients (aged 68 +/- 11 years, under LTOT for 34 +/- 24 months) underwent pulmonary function testing, measurement of average daily distance walked, SaO2, dyspnoea scores (Borg scale and oxygen-cost diagram), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scores. After 1 yr, measurements were repeated, and HRQL was measured with the St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1% of predicted) was 36 +/- 19; SaO2 (room air) was 87 +/- 5%, daily distance walked was 1202 +/- 1140 m; 21% suffered from anxiety and 27% from depression. After 1 yr, pulmonary function tests, dyspnoea or prevalence of anxiety or depression were unchanged. Mortality was high (31% 1-yr mortality). Daily distance walked (rho = -0.55, P = 0.01 vs. SGRQ) and number of days spent in hospital (rho = 0.5, P = 0.01 vs. SGRQ) were the parameters with the highest correlation with HRQL scores. Quality of life was poor in these patients, with high rates of emotional disorders. Restoring and maintaining sufficient exercise capacity for everyday life activities through outpatient rehabilitation programmes and support for emotional disturbances should be major goals in the care of these patients.","Given the equivocal state of the literature as to the symptom-level specificity of the cognitive variable labeled negative problem orientation (NPO), we targeted NPO-symptom relations. A clinical sample (N = 132) of adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, mood disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder completed self-reports of NPO and symptom types (worry, depression, obsessive-compulsive, panic, and social anxiety). Symptom-level specificity was examined using a combination of zero-order and regression analyses that controlled for the other assessed symptoms. Results were that NPO shared small to moderate correlations with the symptoms. Regression results indicated that NPO only shared unique associations with worry, depression, and social anxiety. In the analyses, NPO clustered particularly strongly with worry. The present results provide support for conceptualizing NPO as a cognitive variable common to emotional disorders, but not as related equivalently to all disorders within this category.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""emotional disorders"" refers to a range of mental health conditions that affect mood, anxiety, and overall emotional stability. Text A specifically mentions anxiety and depression as examples of emotional disorders affecting the quality of life of patients undergoing long-term oxygen therapy. In Text B, the term encompasses a broader range of conditions including worry, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic, and social anxiety, and is used in a clinical study context to explore correlations and specificity with a cognitive variable.

Despite the different contexts (medical treatment in Text A and psychological research in Text B), the core significance of ""emotional disorders"" as pertaining to various conditions that impact mental and emotional health remains consistent. Thus, the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" between the two texts remains essentially unchanged, continuing to describe conditions characterized by significant disruptions to emotional and psychological well-being."
91,Emotional disorders,"Brief psychotherapy has demonstrated its effectiveness in treating emotional disorders and helping with problems that typically present to primary care physicians. Because practitioners receive little instruction about this treatment option and often have erroneous preconceived ideas about it, psychotherapy remains underprescribed. Effective brief therapy enables the patient to problem-solve, facilitates the relationship with the provider, and ultimately clarifies the patient's situation. Referral of appropriate patients for psychotherapy will enhance the effectiveness of the doctor in primary care.","Several studies have reported high rates of alexithymia in drug-dependent individuals, but supporting evidence attests association between alexithymia and a variety of psychiatric disorders, raising doubts about its specificity. Moreover, controversies are emerging about alexithymia assessment: self-report measures present shortcomings with respect to discriminant validity and reliability. As regards treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), alexithymia has been linked to poorer outcomes, but the results are inconsistent. The aim of the present study is to investigate alexithymia in substance-dependent young adults by examining: (a) the specificity of alexithymia in drug-dependent inpatients, compared to healthy individuals and patients with psychiatric disorders (behavioral and emotional disorders) and (b) the predictivity of alexithymia in determining treatment outcomes in terms of relapses, drop-outs from treatment and the rate of relapse per month of treatment. Two studies were conducted to fulfill these aims: Study 1 and Study 2. Study 1 involved 90 late adolescents, aged 17-21. To fulfill the first aim, 30 inpatients diagnosed with SUD were compared with 30 healthy controls and 30 individuals referred to an outpatient neuropsychiatric unit (a). The participants completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). The results indicated that both clinical groups reported higher TAS-20 scores than the non-clinical subjects, but they did not differ from each other (a); moreover, a large correlation was detected between alexithymia and depressive symptoms, as assessed by the SCL-90-R. Study 2 involved 55 inpatients with SUD recruited in a therapeutic community. The participants completed the TAS-20, and clinicians filled out the Observer Alexithymia Scale (OAS). No association was found between self-report and observational measures. Neither self-reported nor observed alexithymia predicted the number of relapses, drop-out from treatment, or the rate of relapses per month of treatment (b). When the interaction with gender was explored, the global score of alexithymia and the ""Distant"" OAS subscale predicted the number rate relapses only in males. The TAS-20 did not discriminate between the clinical groups. The limited ability of both observed and self-reported measures in predicting treatment outcome raises questions on the specificity of alexithymia among the substance-dependent inpatient population.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: Both texts address ""emotional disorders"" within the context of psychological and psychiatric frameworks. Text A discusses the effectiveness of brief psychotherapy in treating emotional disorders, emphasizing their presence in a primary care context and the role of psychotherapy in managing them. Text B deals with the study of alexithymia in drug-dependent patients and its association with various psychiatric disorders including emotional disorders. In both contexts, ""emotional disorders"" refer to psychological conditions that affect emotions, suggesting a consistent meaning across both texts despite the different angles of psychiatric examination. Thus, the term has not undergone significant semantic drift and maintains a similar connotation related to mental health disorders affecting emotions."
92,Emotional disorders,"Some Soviet therapists admit the role of latent (that is, sexual) conflicts and childhood experiences in the origin of emotional disorders. They also attempt to utilize the influence of the social environment in the ""readaptation"" of neurotics. However, these attempts are limited by certain ideological as well as practical restrictions.","This paper reviews the development and initial trial of a treatment for adolescents that targets negative emotionality and associated psychological difficulties, particularly anxiety and depressive disorders, as a more singular entity by utilizing an approach rooted in both emotion science and theory. The rationale for such an approach is based upon the perceived need for novel treatment approaches that target commonalities in emotional disorder symptom presentation and their intervention. Utilizing the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders originally developed for adults (Barlow, Allen & Choate, 2004), we conducted a multiple-baseline design study of a slightly modified version of this protocol with three adolescents presenting an array of anxiety and depression symptoms. Adolescent participants in this preliminary investigation evidenced symptom reductions across disorders at post-treatment, with greater improvements noted at a six-month follow-up. Based on these findings and research regarding the association between emotion science and developmental psychopathology, we detail a more extensive set of modifications to the protocol, undertaken in preparation for a subsequent open-trial investigation of the revised treatment.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
In Text A, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used in a broad context, likely referring to a range of mental health issues primarily treated by recognizing the role of psychological conflicts and social environment factors. The narrative shows an understanding of emotional disorders influenced by socio-cultural elements, with a suggestion of a generic approach to managing symptoms using societal influences for readaptation.

In Text B, the usage of ""emotional disorders"" shifts to a more scientific and targeted approach in the context of treatment. It specifically discusses a unified protocol designed to address emotional disorders in adolescents, focusing on commonalities across various symptoms of emotional conditions like anxiety and depression. This text illustrates a modern, structured, and research-informed approach explicitly directing toward treatment aspects based on emotional science, which marks a shift from generalized societal-based management to individualized and protocol-driven clinical interventions.

Thus, the meaning of ""emotional disorders"" has drifted from a broad, somewhat vague, concept prone to societal and psychological interpretations in Text A, to a more defined, clinically addressed category directly relevant to specific therapeutic frameworks in Text B. This change in connotation shows a transition towards an evidence-based, medicalized viewpoint in managing and understanding emotional disorders."
93,Emotional disorders,"Behavioral impairments in parkinsonian patients include agitation, hypersexuality, stereotypic movement, pathological gambling, abuse of antiparkinsonian drugs, REM sleep behavioral disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Dementia, psychoses, and emotional disorders, such as depression and anxiety/panic disorder, also impair behavior. Symptoms may be produced by dysfunction of the central nervous system, medication, and/or the psychosocial problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Treatment therefore should be based on the cause of the symptoms seen. In some cases, the reduction or change of antiparkinsonian drugs, or both, may be effective. Treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including motor fluctuations, may reduce the risk of panic attacks being evoked in the 'off' period. Use of antidepressants, sedatives, and neuroleptics may often be effective. Physicians should identify the causes of the symptoms of behavioral impairment and select appropriate treatments.","Group psychodrama for children is one of the methods of group therapy in treatment of many behavioral and emotional disorders of children. However, it has been used very few in hospital settings. So, in this study, the group psychodrama was applied to evaluate its effectiveness for.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is consistently used to describe a class or category of mental health issues that include conditions like depression and anxiety. Text A discusses emotional disorders within the context of Parkinson’s disease, emphasizing their impact on behavior and treatment approaches. Text B discusses emotional disorders in children, exploring a specific therapy method (group psychodrama) but essentially focusing on treatment for similar mental health conditions. In both cases, ""emotional disorders"" refers broadly to psychological conditions that affect emotions and behaviors, and there is no significant change in the use of the term or its connotation between the two texts."
94,Emotional disorders,"The correlation between scores on two new anxiety questionnaires for children (ns = 54 boys, 54 girls), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children was .72, with values for subtests ranging between .35 and .63.","Attentional networks and their interactions have been extensively studied through the Attentional Network Test for Interaction (ANTI). This task combines a spatial cueing paradigm with a flanker procedure and examines the efficiency and the interactions among the attentional networks (Alerting, Orienting and Executive control). However, the ANTI did not consider the effect of emotions on the attentional systems, although many studies have shown a relationship between emotion and Executive system. This study aims to analyze the executive system in an emotional context. We used a version of ANTI with arrows (ANTI-A) and an ANTI-Emotion (ANTI-E), where the arrows in the flanker task were replaced with neutral and threatening faces. One hundred and thirty-four university students performed both an ANTI-A and an ANTI-E. Results confirmed all the main effects and interactions for both the types of ANTI. Furthermore, the ANTI-E showed that the executive control of the conflict was harder when the target was neutral rather than when it was threatening. This difficulty in solving the flanker task could be due to the effect of distractors with a threatening valence. The ANTI-E could be allowed to verify how much attentional bias that characterizes people with emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety) may depend on altered executive control of the emotional conflict.","###Answer:
- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:** In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the term ""emotional disorders"" appears to remain in the domain of psychological and behavioral analyses. Text A deals directly with emotional disorders by measuring anxiety in children through specially designed questionnaires, while Text B touches on the effect of emotions, specifically those related to emotional disorders such as anxiety, on cognitive functions like executive control. The core context of relating to emotional and cognitive reactions remains consistent across both texts, thus demonstrating that the term ""emotional disorders"" has not undergone significant semantic drift and remains centered around psychological and emotional health concerns."
95,Emotional disorders,"Description of the intervention of psychiatrists with HIV positive hospitalized patients. An analysis of 26 cases over a six-months period. Attention is drawn on the following characteristics: 1) limited extend of the psychiatrist's intervention when the medical team is organized as to allow the patient's psychological support (psychologists participating to the ""staff"", supervision by an independent psychiatrist); 2) specificity of the psychiatrist's intervention in such a context, which relate to: a) the differential diagnosis between psycho-organic syndromes and major emotional disorders, b) in difficult cases, the definition of the therapeutical scope; 3) necessary search for a more adapted support of male patients admitted for psychosocial reasons and especially for addicted patients.","The current study investigates the feasibility and preliminary outcomes associated with a transdiagnostic emotion-focused group protocol for the treatment of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms in youth. Twenty-two children (ages 7 to 12; M=9.79) with a principal anxiety disorder and varying levels of comorbid depressive symptoms were enrolled in an open trial of the Emotion Detectives Treatment Protocol (EDTP; Ehrenreich-May & Bilek, 2009), an intervention adapted from existent unified protocols for the treatment of emotional disorders among adults and adolescents. Results indicate that participants experienced significant improvements in clinician-rated severity of principal anxiety disorder diagnoses (d=1.38), the sum of all anxiety and depressive disorder severity ratings (d=1.07), and child-reported anxiety (d=0.47) and parent-reported depressive symptoms (d=0.54) at the posttreatment assessment. EDTP had good retention rates and reports of high satisfaction. Thus, preliminary evidence suggests that EDTP is a feasible and potentially efficacious treatment of youth anxiety disorders and co-occurring depressive symptoms. Children experiencing a range of internalizing symptoms may benefit from this more generalized, emotion-focused treatment modality, as it offers flexibility to families and the mental health clinician, while maintaining a concurrent focus on the provision of cognitive-behavioral treatment skills vital to the amelioration of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms in youth.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" is used to describe conditions affecting the psychological health of individuals. Text A focuses on the differentiation and management of emotional disorders among hospitalized HIV patients by psychiatrists, while Text B examines the treatment of emotional disorders, specifically anxiety and depression, in children through a specific group protocol. In both instances, the term refers to psychological disturbances or illnesses that are manifested by emotional symptoms and may necessitate intervention or therapy. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the term ""emotional disorders"" between the two time periods reviewed, as it consistently represents conditions that impact emotional health and require psychological management."
96,Emotional disorders,"In a study of differential validity, three diagnostic groups based on ICD-10 criteria were compared, namely children with emotional disorders, children with conduct disorders, and children with mixed disorders of conduct and emotions. The patients were taken from a consecutive series of child and adolescent psychiatric service attenders from 1988 to 1992 and represented the total entire subgroups of patients with the respective diagnoses. Based on standardized item sheets that were filled out by the clinicians who were responsible for the respective cases, the groups were compared with regard to age, sex ratio, family background, premorbid behavioral abnormalities, abnormal psychosocial situations, and treatment. It was found that children with mixed disorders of conduct and emotions share many characteristics with pure conduct disordered children. It is concluded that the former group is a subgroup of the latter, and there is little evidence in this study supporting the validity of a separate category of mixed disorders of conduct and emotions.","Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is a recent treatment with established efficacy in mental health settings. MCT is grounded in the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model of emotional disorders and treats a negative perseverative style of thinking called the cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS), thought to maintain psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The evaluation of effective psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in chronic physical illness is a priority and research in this area depends on the suitability and validity of measures assessing key psychological constructs. The present study examined the psychometric performance of a ten-item scale measuring the CAS, the CAS-1R, in a sample of cardiac rehabilitation patients experiencing mild to severe symptoms of anxiety and/or depression (","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A (from the earlier period), the term ""emotional disorders"" predominantly refers to specific diagnostic categories within child and adolescent psychiatry, focusing largely on behavioral and psychosocial factors manifesting as emotional disorders. It is mentioned in the context of diagnostic validity and comparison among different mental health disorders in children based on observed behaviors and familial background. 

  In Text B (from the later period), ""emotional disorders"" is used in a broader and more integrative psychological and neurobiological framework, specifically related to the Self-Regulatory Executive Function model. Here, emotional disorders are discussed in relation to cognitive processes, particularly the 'cognitive attentional syndrome' which is a pattern of negative, perseverative thinking contributing to the maintenance of these disorders. The focus is more on the internal cognitive mechanisms and their treatment through Metacognitive Therapy, rather than just the external behavioral manifestations and diagnostic categories.

  This shift from a more behaviorally oriented understanding to a cognitive and metacognitive perspective indicates a significant semantic drift in the understanding and application of the term ""emotional disorders"" over time."

Depression is a serious condition and is projected to be the top contributor to the global burden of disease by 2030. The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in hypertension and emotional disorders is well established. Evidence points to an association between elevated RAS activity and depression and anxiety, partly through the induction of neuroinflammation, stress, and oxidative stress. Therefore, blocking the RAS provides a theoretical basis for future treatment of anxiety and depression. The evidence for the positive effects of RAS blockers on depression and anxiety is reviewed, aiming to provide a promising target for novel anxiolytic and antidepressant medications and/or for improving the efficacy of currently available medications used for the treatment of anxiety and depression, which independent of blood pressure management.","### Answer:
- Target word: Emotional disorders
- Text A: Discusses the prevalence of emotional disorders (specifically depression, anxiety, and panic disorders) among patients visiting a rheumatology service. The focus is on detection rates by rheumatologists and the association between these disorders and factors such as diagnosis category, gender, symptom burden, disability, and socioeconomic status.
- Text B: Explores the considerable contribution of emotional disorders like depression and anxiety to global morbidity. Specifically, it focuses on the biochemical and physiological influences such as the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in these disorders and discusses potential treatments targeting this system to manage depression and anxiety.
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Despite different focuses in each text, the essential meaning and context of ""emotional disorders"" remain the same. In both texts, the term refers broadly to psychiatric conditions primarily involving mood and affect, such as anxiety and depression. The discussion in Text A emphasizes detection and epidemiological factors while Text B explores biochemical mechanisms and treatment implications. However, there is no significant semantic drift in the term itself across the texts. Both maintain the understanding of ""emotional disorders"" as psychiatric conditions affecting mood and affect, consistent with general medical and psychological usage.

Diagnostically a somewhat greater number of psychosis, neurotic/emotional disorders were found among the part-time group and they showed also more associations with abnormal familial background, a higher proportion of part-time patients were not discharged to their families and have been treated for a longer time respectively. Not related to the length of treatment a significantly more positive successful treatment could be demonstrated among the part-time group.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to psychiatric or psychological conditions that affect an individual's emotional stability and capacity to function. Text A discusses emotional disorders in the context of treatment outcomes and diagnostic patterns among psychiatric patients, while Text B considers emotional disorders in relation to the ability of individuals to regulate emotions in different cultural and situational contexts.

99,Emotional disorders,"To study vegetative regulation and emotional status of ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients with various pain severity, 81 patients with IHD were examined. Personality characteristics were studied by the data of MMPI questionnaire, reactive and personal anxiety--of Spilberger questionnaire, depressive changes--of Beck's questionnaire, vegetative status--by vegetative discharge, Seattle angina questionnaire of life quality, heart rhythm variability and cardiovascular tests. All the patients have undergone clinical examination, exercise stress tests, echocardiography. Selective coronary angiography was made in some examinees. The patients were divided into two groups by anginal pain severity. The patients with more severe anginal pain had higher reactive and personal anxiety, neurotization. This was not associated with changes in the vegetative status and hemodynamics at rest. The detected emotional disorders in IHD patients may cause higher sensitivity of these patients to pain, on the one side, and changes in vegetative regulation of cardiovascular system and hemodynamics, on the other.","Characterization of neuronal dendritic structure in combination with the determination of specific neuronal phenotype or temporal generation is a challenging task. Here we present a novel method that combines bromodioxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry with Golgi-impregnation technique; with this simple non-invasive method, we are able to determine the tridimensional structure of dendritic arborization and spine shape of neurons born at a specific time in the hippocampus of adult animals. This analysis is relevant in physiological and pathological conditions in which altered neurogenesis is implicated, such as aging or emotional disorders.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""emotional disorders"" refers to conditions that affect the emotional stability or psychological state of individuals. In Text A, emotional disorders are discussed within the context of ischemic heart disease patients, emphasizing the impact of these disorders on pain sensation, vegetative regulation, and cardiovascular system functioning. Here, ""emotional disorders"" pertains to a range of issues like anxiety and depression that correlate with physical symptoms and pain perception.

Similarly, in Text B, ""emotional disorders"" is mentioned in relation to the study of neuronal structures in the hippocampus, an area significantly impacted by emotional disorders in physiological and pathological conditions. This highlights the neuropsychological aspect of such disorders, showing their effect on brain structures and functions.

Despite the different contexts—one focusing on the cardiovascular implications and the other on neurogenesis and structural brain changes—the core meaning of ""emotional disorders"" as conditions affecting mental health and emotional stability remains consistent between the two texts. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift observed in the use of the term ""emotional disorders"" from one period to the other."
0,Autism spectrum disorder,"Common genetic disorders are believed to arise from the combined effects of multiple inherited genetic variants acting in concert with environmental factors, such that any given DNA sequence variant may have only a marginal effect on disease outcome. As a consequence, the correlation between disease status and any given DNA marker allele in a genomewide linkage study tends to be relatively weak and the implicated regions typically encompass hundreds of positional candidate genes. Therefore, new strategies are needed to parse relatively large sets of 'positional' candidate genes in search of actual disease-related gene variants. Here we use biological databases to identify 383 positional candidate genes predicted by genomewide genetic linkage analysis of a large set of families, each with two or more members diagnosed with autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Next, we seek to identify a subset of biologically meaningful, high priority candidates. The strategy is to select autism candidate genes based on prior genetic evidence from the allelic association literature to query the known transcripts within the 1-LOD (logarithm of the odds) support interval for each region. We use recently developed bioinformatic programs that automatically search the biological literature to predict pathways of interacting genes (PATHWAYASSIST and GENEWAYS). To identify gene regulatory networks, we search for coexpression between candidate genes and positional candidates. The studies are intended both to inform studies of autism, and to illustrate and explore the increasing potential of bioinformatic approaches as a compliment to linkage analysis.","Investigations of autonomic nervous system biomarkers in autism have been sparse relative to its prevalence. Recent studies of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have increasingly drawn correlations between autonomic findings and psychosocial behavior. Studies of heart rate variability, pupil size, salivary alpha-amylase, and electrodermal responsiveness have shown that children with ASD differ from normally developing children in their autonomic responsiveness to visualizing human faces and other mental tasks. While some results have conflicted, much of the data appears to support the theory of a hypersympathetic state in autism insufficiently attenuated by vagal parasympathetic influences. To what degree these differences in autonomic physiology might influence cognitive processing and behavior rather than simply being epiphenomena of a pervasive disorder of brain development is as yet unclear.","### Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
- Text A: Discusses a study focusing on the genetic determinants of autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), involving linkage analysis to pinpoint candidate genes that might contribute to ASD based on familial patterns. The emphasis is on the complex genetic backbone of the disorder, reflecting the understanding of ASD as a condition impacted by multiple genes alongside environmental interactions.
- Text B: Shifts focus towards the physiological and behavioral markers of autism, particularly regarding how individuals with ASD differ in their autonomic responses compared to those without ASD. Here, the interest lies more in the observable physiological reactions and their possible implications on cognitive processing and behavioral responses, rather than strictly genetic causes.

### Label: 
- Changed

### Reason:
- The usage of the term ""autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" has shifted from a mainly genetic and purely clinical focus looking at the internal mechanisms from a genomic perspective in Text A, to a broader multidisciplinary perspective in Text B that includes physiological manifestations and their potential impact on behavior and cognition.
- This drift signifies an evolution in understanding the disorder from being seen largely as a genetic construct to being viewed as a multifaceted spectrum with significant behavioral and physiological considerations, reflecting broader diagnostic criteria and a deeper appreciation of the complexity of ASD as it relates to everyday functioning and individual differences."
1,Autism spectrum disorder,"This study compared the neuropsychological test profiles of non-mentally retarded girls and boys consecutively referred to a neuropsychiatric clinic and those of contrast cases of girls from mainstream classrooms of one Göteborg school district. To avoid overreliance on the male prototype with regard to diagnostic criteria the clinical group comprised a mixed sample of girls and boys without diagnostic subgrouping. Clinic girls had a lower IQ than comparison girls. Girls were more impaired than the boys with respect to executive functions and scored less well on theory of mind tasks. Previous studies have shown girls with autism and mental retardation to be more severely affected than boys both with regard to level of intellectual functioning and overall measures of brain dysfunction. The present study indicates that clinic girls with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders at higher levels of intellectual functioning (some of which met diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder) may also be more severely affected than boys with corresponding types of ""surface"" problems.","Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and numerous systemic complications including seizures, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and renal anomalies.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" refers to a developmental disorder characterized by challenges with social interaction, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Text A discusses the impact and severity of autism spectrum disorder across different genders in a clinical setting, while Text B mentions autism spectrum disorder as part of the broader characteristics of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. Although the focus and context of each text vary—one being a study on gender differences in autism and the other outlining a specific syndrome's attributes—the underlying concept and usage of ""autism spectrum disorder"" remain constant, referring to a categorized neurodevelopmental disorder. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the term's meaning between the two texts."
2,Autism spectrum disorder,"The aim was to explore the comorbidity between Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Identification of autism in children with Angelman syndrome presents a diagnostic challenge. In the present study, 16 children with Angelman syndrome, all with a 15q11-13 deletion, were examined for ASDs. Thirteen children with Angelman syndrome received an ADOS-G algorithm classification of ASD; the remaining three were outside the autistic spectrum. Ten fulfilled the criteria for autism, and three for PDD-NOS. The 10 children with Angelman syndrome and comorbid autism were compared with eight children with only autism regarding their social and communicative skills. The results indicated that Angelman syndrome is better understood in terms of developmental delay, and autism in terms of developmental deviance. It is concluded that autism might have been overdiagnosed due to the extremely low mental age of the children with Angelman syndrome.","Serotonin syndrome, also known as serotonin toxicity, is associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central and the peripheral nervous system. The symptoms can range from mild to potentially life threatening. Given the widespread use of serotonergic agents, the number of cases is on the rise. It is seen with therapeutic medication use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, and intentional self-poisoning, but still known cases with monotherapy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are uncommon. Another known fact is that elevated whole blood serotonin, or hyperserotonemia, is one of the first biomarkers identified in autism spectrum disorder and is present in more than 25% of affected children. We present a case of a 32-year-old male with a history of autism spectrum disorder and depressive disorder who presented to the emergency department with restless agitation, neuromuscular excitability, and autonomic instability. He had been prescribed sertraline 50 mg which he had taken daily as prescribed for 4 days. On the fourth day, he presented to the emergency department with diffuse muscle stiffness, upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus, and inducible ankle clonus. He was diagnosed with probable serotonin syndrome utilizing Hunter's criteria. Patient's symptoms resolved within 24 hours with intravenous fluids, lorazepam, and discontinuation of sertraline. This case highlights the importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion in patients even on monotherapy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in therapeutic doses, especially in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder. Due to preexisting hyperserotonemia, they may be more susceptible to serotonin syndrome than the general population.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) retains its clinical and diagnostic connotation, highlighting aspects of neurological and behavioral conditions. Text A discusses the diagnosis of autism within the context of Angelman syndrome, which primarily focuses on the identification and differentiation of autism symptoms within another genetic disorder. Text B describes a case involving autism spectrum disorder, noting a known biomarker (hyperserotonemia) and its implications for heightened susceptibility to serotonin syndrome in such patients. There is no significant shift in the way ASD is conceptually understood or discussed between the two texts. Thus, the usage of ""autism spectrum disorder"" demonstrates stability over the given timeframe, pointing towards consistent medical and clinical implications associated with the term."
3,Autism spectrum disorder,"We have evaluated possible contributions of HLA-DRB1 alleles to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 103 families of Caucasian descent. The DR4 allele occurred more often in probands than controls (0.007), whereas the DR13,14 alleles occurred less often in probands than controls (p = 0.003). The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) indicated that the ASD probands inherited the DR4 allele more frequently than expected (p = 0.026) from the fathers. The TDT also revealed that fewer DR13 alleles than expected were inherited from the mother by ASD probands (p = 0.006). We conclude that the TDT results suggest that DR4 and DR13 are linked to ASD. Reasons for the parental inheritance of specific alleles are poorly understood but coincide with current genetic research noting possible parent-of-origin effects in autism.","Little research has been conducted on whether deficits in developmental functioning affect the range of core symptoms for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study represents a first attempt to determine whether developmental level has an effect on the expression of ASD symptoms in infants and toddlers. Eight hundred and fifty-three infants were evaluated with respect to the nature and extent of their ASD symptoms and developmental functioning. Young children with autism displayed a higher number of symptoms than those with PDD-NOS on all three domains of impairment (social, communication, repetitive behaviors). As expected, children without an ASD evinced far fewer symptoms than both these groups. Developmental level was not found to be a moderator for expression of ASD symptoms for the entire sample, or individual diagnostic groups. Higher developmental level was associated with lower severity of evinced ASD symptoms in the sample.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) is consistently used to refer to a complex developmental condition characterized primarily by challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavioral patterns. Text A focuses on genetic associations of ASD, suggesting certain alleles might contribute to its development. Text B examines the influence of developmental levels on the expression of ASD symptoms, aiming to identify if developmental functioning affects core ASD symptoms. In both texts, despite differing research focuses, the underlying concept of ASD remains the same — it is a developmental disorder impacting certain core human functions. The examples cover genetic and developmental influences, but the essential meaning and diagnostic criteria employed to discuss ASD have not shifted between the texts."

Text A discusses the association of ASD with various congenital conditions and compares studies that link ASD with different syndromes and disorders. Text B, meanwhile, focuses on the importance of early diagnosis and accessibility of treatments for ASD to improve outcomes. In both contexts, the term is used to denote the same disorder, focusing on its identification and associated conditions or implications. Despite the different focuses—comparative in Text A and epidemiological in Text B—the underlying subject, ""autism spectrum disorder,"" refers to the same specific medical and developmental condition in both cases."
5,Autism spectrum disorder,"A tendency to focus on details at the expense of configural information, 'weak coherence', has been proposed as a cognitive style in autism. In the present study we tested whether weak coherence might be the result of executive dysfunction, by testing clinical groups known to show deficits on tests of executive control. Boys with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were compared with age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing (TD) boys, on a drawing task requiring planning for the inclusion of a new element. Weak coherence was measured through analysis of drawing style. In line with the predictions made, the ASD group was more detail-focused in their drawings than were either ADHD or TD boys. The ASD and ADHD groups both showed planning impairments, which were more severe in the former group. Poor planning did not, however, predict detail-focus, and scores on the two aspects of the task were unrelated in the clinical groups. These findings indicate that weak coherence may indeed be a cognitive style specific to autism and unrelated to cognitive deficits in frontal functions.","Limited research exists regarding the role of teachers in screening for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The current study examined the use of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) as completed by parents and teachers about school-age children from the Simons Simplex Collection. Using the recommended cutoff scores in the manuals and extant literature, the teacher-completed SCQ and SRS yielded lower sensitivity and specificity values than would be desirable; however, lowering the cutoff scores on both instruments improved sensitivity and specificity to more adequate levels for screening purposes. Using the adjusted cutoff scores, the SRS teacher form appears to be a slightly better screener than the SCQ. Implications and limitations are discussed, as well as areas for future research.","###Answer:

Despite different focal points (cognitive styles in Text A and diagnostic screening in Text B), the definition and implication of ASD as a spectrum of related disorders affecting individuals' social interactions, behaviors, and cognitive functions remain consistent between the texts. There is no significant semantic shift in the understanding or usage of the term ASD over the time span between the two texts."
6,Autism spectrum disorder,"The plasma amino acid profiles of 36 children with autism spectrum disorders were reviewed to determine the impact of diet on amino acid patterns. Ten of the children were on gluten and casein restricted diets administered by parents, while the other 26 consumed unrestricted diets. No amino acid profile specific to autism was identified. However, children with autism had more essential amino acid deficiencies consistent with poor protein nutrition than an age/gender matched control group. There was a trend for children with autism who were on restricted diets to have an increased prevalence of essential amino acid deficiencies and lower plasma levels of essential acids including the neurotransmitter precursors tyrosine and tryptophan than both controls and children with autism on unrestricted diets. These data indicate that larger, more focused studies of protein nutrition in children with autism are needed in order to determine the extent to which restricted diets might place the developing brains of children with autism at risk from protein malnutrition. The high rate of tryptophan and tyrosine deficiency in this group is also of concern given their role as neurotransmitter precursors.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders, diagnosed in early childhood when acquired skills are lost or the acquisition of new skills becomes delayed. ASDs are associated with varying degrees of dysfunctional communication and social skills, in addition to repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. The diagnosis has increased considerably to approximately one in 180 people, but it is not clear whether this is because of a higher prevalence of the disorder, improved awareness by clinicians or a combination of both. There are no defined mechanisms of pathogenesis or curative therapy presently available. Oxidative stress, overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased gut-blood-brain-barrier permeability might be involved. The scope of this article is to integrate these findings and present the opinion that non-allergic activation of gastrointestinal and brain mast cells could contribute to many of the pathologic findings and provide unique targets for ASD therapy. We make suggestions for new research directives and possible novel therapies from readily available molecules.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) retains its core meaning as a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges in communication, social skills, and the presence of repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. Text A focuses on the potential nutritional impacts of diet on children with ASD, especially those on restricted diets, and mentions the role of neurotransmitter precursors. Text B discusses broader aspects of ASD, including potential causes and the increase in diagnosis rates, suggesting complex interactions involving the gut and brain. Although the focus and details differ between the texts, the fundamental understanding of ASD as a neurodevelopmental condition with specific behavioral and cognitive symptoms remains consistent. The term has not undergone significant semantic drift in meaning or connotation over the period between the two texts."
7,Autism spectrum disorder,"Tuberous sclerosis is one of the few established medical causes of autism spectrum disorder and is a unique neurogenetic model for testing theories about the brain basis of the syndrome. We conducted a retrospective case study of the neuro-epileptic risk factors predisposing to autism spectrum disorder in individuals with tuberous sclerosis to test current neurobiological theories of autism spectrum disorder. We found that an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was associated with the presence of cortical tubers in the temporal but not other lobes of the brain. Indeed, the presence of tubers in the temporal lobes appeared to be a necessary but not sufficient risk factor for the development of an autism spectrum disorder. However, contrary to the predictions of some theories, the location of tubers in specific regions of the temporal lobe, such as the superior temporal gyrus or the right temporal lobe, did not determine which individuals with temporal lobe tubers developed an autism spectrum disorder. Instead, outcome was associated with various indices of epileptic activity including evidence of temporal lobe epileptiform discharges on EEG, the age to onset of seizures in the first 3 years of life and a history of infantile spasms. The results indicated that individuals with tuberous sclerosis are at very high risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder when temporal lobe tubers are present and associated with temporal lobe epileptiform discharges and early-onset, persistent spasm-like seizures. These risk markers constitute useful clinical indicators of prognosis, but further research is required to identify the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for their association with outcome. Most especially, it will be important to test whether, as the findings suggest, there is a critical early stage of brain maturation during which temporal lobe epilepsy perturbs the development of brain systems that underpin 'social intelligence' and possibly other cognitive skills, thereby inducing an autism spectrum disorder.","Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, interests, or activities are a critical diagnostic criterion for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies using gambling paradigms with ASD populations have identified that, unlike typically developed control participants, people with a diagnosis of ASD tend to maintain particular response patterns regardless of the magnitude of potential outcomes to uncertain gains or losses. Here we designed a gambling test that permitted calculation of the response consistency in gambling choices in situations that presented varying expected outcomes in terms of gains or losses. The task was administered to 33 adults with a diagnosis of ASDs and compared to a group of 47 typically-developed (TD) control participants who were matched for age and IQ. When presented with choices where participants could either make a risky gamble or a safe choice in terms of gains or losses (e.g., 20% chance of winning £5 vs. 100% chance of winning £1), the ASD participants did not differ from the TDs in their overall risk-taking behaviour. However, they were more consistent in their individual choices from trial to trial. Furthermore, the proportion of participants who either implemented an invariate response strategy (e.g., either always choosing the most risky or most ""safe"" option) was significantly higher in the ASD group compared with the controls. Additionally, while the ASD group were slower to make their responses in the win frame and the first half of the lose frame, by the end of the task their decision times were the same as the TD controls. These findings suggest that the ASD tendency towards repetitive behaviour may demonstrate itself even in high-level decision-making tasks, which needs to be understood if we are to be sure what such tasks are measuring.","- Label: Unchanged

9,Autism spectrum disorder,"The item, total, and subscale scores on the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) were compared for 155 mute and 335 speaking individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Although no significant difference was observed between the groups on the ABC total score, the mute group demonstrated significantly more pathology on 21 of 57 items and 3 of 5 subscales. The speaking group obtained significantly higher scores on only 8 items and 1 subscale (Language). The appropriateness of providing greater pathology scores on expressive language items to speaking, rather than to mute, individuals is called into question. The authors speculate whether the expressive language items are weighted too heavily, in regard both to the Language subscale and to the ABC total score. If the expressive language items were removed, the mute group would have significantly higher ABC total scores and therefore a greater degree of autism severity.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social interaction, social communication, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Recent work has begun to explore gene × environmental interactions in the etiology of ASD. We previously reported that prenatal stress exposure in stress-susceptible heterozygous serotonin transporter (SERT) KO pregnant dams in a mouse model resulted in autism-like behavior in the offspring (SERT/S mice). The association between prenatal stress and ASD appears to be affected by maternal SERT genotype in clinical populations as well. Using the mouse model, we examined autistic-like behaviors in greater detail, and additionally explored whether diet supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may mitigate the behavioral changes. Only male SERT/S mice showed social impairment and stereotyped behavior, and DHA supplementation ameliorated some of these behaviors. We also measured monoamine levels in the SERT/S mice after three treatment paradigms: DHA-rich diet continuously from breeding (DHA diet), DHA-rich diet only after weaning (CTL/DHA diet) and control diet only (CTL diet). The dopamine (DA) content in the striatum was significantly increased in the SERT/S mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, whereas no difference was observed with noradrenaline and serotonin content. Moreover, DA content in the striatum was significantly reduced in the SERT/S mice with the DHA-rich diet provided continuously from breeding. The results indicate that autism-associated behaviors and changes in the dopaminergic system in this setting can be mitigated with DHA supplementation.","- Label: Unchanged

10,Autism spectrum disorder,"Earlier identification of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is welcome, but presents a number of challenges to the clinical and the research enterprises (see Charman & Baird [2002] for a review). In the research enterprise, one critical methodological challenge is the use of appropriate measures on which to match groups of preschoolers with ASDs to comparison groups with other neurodevelopmental conditions. Language and communication impairments are central to the diagnosis of ASD and, therefore, critical variables to consider in group-matched research designs. In the domain of language function the challenges include the very poor language competence of many preschoolers with ASDs, the fact that some early language competencies form part of the formal diagnostic criteria of ASD and diagnostic algorithms on research diagnostic instruments, the uneven profile of language competency in children with ASDs, and the difference between performance on measures of formal language competency in the testing situation and everyday language use. The current paper will review these challenges and suggest some possible approaches to overcome them, including using more than one measure of language ability and adopting a pragmatic approach to group composition and statistical analysis.","Electroencephalogram-recorded epileptiform activity is common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), even without clinical seizures.

11,Autism spectrum disorder,"Possible connections between immunization and developmental disorders, most notably autistic disorders, have been the subject of a great deal of debate and have caused much concern for parents who want to make the safest choices for their children. Anxiety has risen steadily since the mid-1990s, when a medical investigative team led by A Wakefield postulated that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be a causative factor in the development of autism spectrum disorder. Since this initial publication, immunization remains controversial for some parents and the uptake of the MMR vaccine has fallen in some countries, despite much discussion regarding the safety of MMR, a lack of evidence for an association between MMR and autism, and the risks of insufficient protection against wild measles virus infection. The Canadian uptake of MMR in 1998 was 95%, but data do not exist to document any change in Canada since that time. Many clinicians are concerned that the uptake in younger siblings of children with autism is considerably lower.Further anxiety for parents has been caused by the suggested association between developmental disorders and mercury toxicity due to thimerosal, which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. Many Canadian parents, while continuing to seek chelation therapy in response to this suggestion, are not aware that, in Canada, thimerosal has never been added to MMR, and has not been present in diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-poliomyelitis or pentavalent vaccines since 1992. It is found in only Hepatitis B vaccine in some provinces.The present article is intended to be a guide for physicians as they counsel parents.","This chapter reviews the literature surrounding autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their relation to gastrointestinal (GI), behavioral, neurological, and immunological functioning. Individuals with ASD often have poor GI health, including bowel motility issues, autoimmune and/or other adverse responses to certain foods, and lack of necessary nutrient absorption. These issues may be caused or exacerbated by restrictive behavioral patterns (e.g., preference for sweet and salty foods and/or refusal of healthy foods). Those individuals with GI issues tend to demonstrate more behavioral deficits (e.g., irritability, agitation, hyperactivity) and also tend to have an imbalance in overall gut microbiome composition, thus corroborating several studies that have implicated brain-gut pathways as potential mediators of behavioral dysfunction.We examine the literature regarding dietary approaches to managing ASDs, including elimination diets for gluten, casein, or complex carbohydrates, a ketogenic diet, and a low oxalate diet. We also explore the research examining dietary supplements such as fatty acids, pro- and prebiotics, vitamins, minerals, glutathione, phytochemicals, and hormones. The research on dietary approaches to managing ASDs is limited and the results are mixed. However, a few approaches, such as the gluten-free/casein-free diet, fatty acid supplementation, and pre/probiotics have generally demonstrated improved GI and associated behavioral symptoms. Given that GI issues seem to be overrepresented in ASD populations, and that GI issues have been associated with a number behavioral and neurological deficits, dietary manipulation may offer a cheap and easily implemented approach to improve the lives of those with ASD.","###Answer:

12,Autism spectrum disorder,To test the hypothesis that a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain measures obtained during early childhood distinguish children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) from typically developing children and is associated with functional outcome.,"The Tower of London (TOL) is probably the most often used assessment tool for planning ability in healthy and clinical samples. Various versions, including our proposed standard problem set, have proven to be feasible and reliable in adults. In contrast, reliability information for typically developing (TD) children and neurodevelopmental disorders during childhood are largely missing. Also, it would be highly desirable to attain a problem set that can be used across the whole lifespan. Therefore, here we examine reliability of our proposed standard problem set using a computerized TOL version in 178 TD children (two different samples), 49 children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 56 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (age ranges of each group 6 to 13 years), and 130 young adults (age range 18 to 32 years). Greatest lower bound estimates of reliability were adequate to high in the two samples of TD children (.76 and .80) and high to very high in patients (ASD: .90; ADHD: .83). In young adults, all reliability indices were adequate to high. Moreover, a subset of four- and five-move problems exhibited sufficient performance variability and high part-whole correlations with the complete problem set in all samples. These findings demonstrate the reliability of the presented TOL problem set in both clinical and non-clinical child samples. A clinically feasible subset of four- and five-move problems is reflective of overall planning performance at all ages, hence enabling comparisons of planning ability within and between developmental samples across almost the whole lifespan.","- Label: Unchanged

13,Autism spectrum disorder,"This paper identifies instruments and measures that may be appropriate for randomized clinical trials in participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The Clinical Global Impressions scale was recommended for all randomized clinical trials. At this point, however, there is no ""perfect"" choice of outcome measure for core features of autism, although we will discuss five measures of potential utility. Several communication instruments are recommended, based in part on suitability across the age range. In trials where the intention is to alter core features of ASDs, adaptive behavior scales are also worthy of consideration. Several ""behavior complexes"" common to ASDs are identified, and instruments are recommended for assessment of these. Given the prevalence of cognitive impairment in ASDs, it is important to assess any cognitive effects, although cognitive data from ASD randomized clinical trials, thus far, are minimal. Guidance from trials in related pharmacologic areas and behavioral pharmacology may be helpful. We recommend routine elicitation of side effects, height and weight, vital signs, and (in the case of antipsychotics) extrapyramidal side-effects assessment.

14,Autism spectrum disorder,"Mouse mutants of the homeobox transcription factor Engrailed2 (En2) and autistic individuals display similar cerebellar morphological abnormalities, which include hypoplasia and a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells. Human EN2 maps to 7q36, a chromosomal region that has demonstrated suggestive linkage to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To investigate EN2 for evidence of association with ASD, four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3735653, rs1861972, rs1861973, rs2361689) that span the majority of the 8.0 kb gene were assessed by the transmission/disequilibrium test. Initially, 138 triads of autistic individuals and their parents were tested. Two intronic SNPs (rs1861972 and rs1861973) demonstrated significant association with autism (rs1861972, P=0.0018; rs1861973, P=0.0003; haplotype, P=0.000005). Flanking exonic SNPs (rs3735653 and rs2361689) did not display association. This analysis was then extended to include 167 small nuclear ASD pedigrees and significant association was again only observed for rs1861972 and rs1861973 under both the narrow and broad diagnostic criteria (narrow: rs1861972 P=0.0290, rs1861973 P=0.0073, haplotype P=0.0009; broad: rs1861972 P=0.0175, rs1861973 P=0.0107, haplotype P=0.0024).

promise to reveal functional biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. However,
extracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted
neuropatholo-gies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets
increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of
uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to
those face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the
feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an
application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large
(N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines
that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI
pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined
brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn
patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals
with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the
same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for
the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full
ABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We
perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by
different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors
contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction
accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of
subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of
paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large
R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.

In the general population, the prevalence of autistic disorder was 0.09% at the end of the follow-up period -a minimum estimate, as children with average intelligence were not screened. Autism spectrum disorders were found in 19.8% of children with mental retardation, including strictly defined autistic disorder (DSM-III-R criteria) in 8.9%; the two-year follow-up yielded a higher prevalence of 11.7% with autistic disorder. Among children with cerebral palsy, 10.5% had an autism spectrum disorder. Clear co-variation was found between mental retardation, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders in this population of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.","Dysregulation has been identified as an important risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, it is necessary to empirically characterize dysregulation and identify psychometrically sound and readily available assessment methods in the ASD population. We sought to evaluate the factor structure of the Child Behavior Checklist-Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP), an established dysregulation measure in neurotypical children that is derived from the CBCL, in a large, clinically referred sample of children, ages 6-18 years, with ASD (n = 727). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to characterize dysregulation and assess the validity of the CBCL-DP in children with ASD. Our findings support a bi-factor model of dysregulation in which dysregulation is a broad and distinct syndrome that is associated with the three subdomains of the CBCL-DP, anxiety/depression (AD), attention problems (AP), and aggressive behavior (AGG). Dysregulation was associated with most items in the AD and AGG domains and few items in the AP domain. This association with AD and AGG indicates that dysregulation in ASD may be conceptualized as the combined experience of internalized, negative mood states and externalized, reactive behaviors. These findings provide support as well as important caveats for the use of the CBCL-DP as a measure of dysregulation in the ASD population.

Findings indicate that the major area of difference between children with autism and those with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified, was expressive communication; specifically, the use of elaborations in syntax and morphology and in pragmatic use of language to convey and to seek information in discourse. Linear discriminant function analysis revealed that scores on just three of these expressive communication item sets correctly identified subjects in the two diagnostic categories with 80% overall accuracy.

Gain-of-function mutations of MECP2 cause MECP2 duplication syndrome, a severe neurological disorder with core symptoms of ASD. However, abnormal brain developments underlying the autistic-like behavioral deficits of MECP2 duplication syndrome are rarely investigated. To this end, a human MECP2 duplication (MECP2-DP) rat model was created by the bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic method. Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-field were performed on 16 male MECP2-DP rats and 15 male wildtype rats at postnatal 28 days, 42 days, and 56 days old. Multimodal fusion analyses guided by locomotor-relevant metrics and social novelty time separately were applied to identify abnormal brain networks associated with diverse behavioral deficits induced by MECP2 duplication. Aberrant functional developments of a core network primarily composed of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) were detected to associate with diverse behavioral phenotypes in MECP2-DP rats. Altered developments of gray matter volume were detected in the hippocampus and thalamus. We conclude that gain-of-function mutations of MECP2 induce aberrant functional activities in the default-mode-like network and aberrant volumetric changes in the brain, resulting in autistic-like behavioral deficits.

17,Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are among the most heritable of all neuropsychiatric disorders. Discovery of autism susceptibility genes has been the focus of intense research efforts over the last 10 years, and current estimates suggest that 10 to 20 different interacting genes are involved. Evidence from twin and family studies demonstrates increased risk in family members not only for autistic disorder, but also for a milder constellation of similar symptoms referred to as the broader phenotype. In addition, several genetic syndromes and chromosomal anomalies have been associated with ASD. Large family studies using linkage-analysis techniques have demonstrated several chromosomal regions thought to harbor genes related to the disorder. Finally, specific candidate genes based on function and location have been explored; these studies are reviewed here.","The social and communicative difficulties that characterize autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are considered the most striking feature of the disorder. Research has reported that individuals with ASD show abnormalities in the brain regions associated with the processing of social information. Importantly, a recent study using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) found the first evidence of atypicalities in the neural processing of social information in 4- to 6-month-old infants at high familial risk of ASD. These findings provide an important step in the search for early markers of ASD and highlight the potential for neuroimaging techniques to detect atypical patterns of neural activity prior to the manifestation of most behavioural symptoms. This study aimed to extend the findings of reduced neural sensitivity to social stimuli in an independent cohort. Twenty-nine 5-month-old infants (13 low-risk infants, 16 high-risk infants) were presented with social and non-social visual stimuli, similar to the previous experiment. Importantly, a non-social dynamic motion control condition was introduced allowing the comparison between social dynamic and non-social, static, as well as dynamic stimuli. We found that while low-risk infants showed activation to social stimuli in the right posterior temporal cortex, this activation was reduced in infants at high risk of ASD. Although the current sample size was relatively small, our results replicate and extend previous work and provide evidence for a social processing difference in infants at risk of autism.

Neuroimaging research has attempted to identify abnormalities in components of these systems that would underlie the behavioral abnormalities seen in disorders of social and emotional processing, notably autism spectrum disorders, the focus of this review. However, the findings have been variable. The most replicated anatomic finding (a tendency toward large brains) is not modular, and metabolic imaging and functional imaging (although showing substantial atypicality in activation) are not consistent regarding specific anatomic sites. Moreover, autism spectrum disorder demonstrates substantial heterogeneity on multiple levels. Here evidence is marshaled from a review of neuroimaging data to support the claim that abnormalities in social and emotional processing on the autism spectrum are a consequence of systems disruptions in which the behaviors are a final common pathway and the focal findings can be variable, downstream of other pathogenetic mechanisms, and downstream of more pervasive abnormalities.","Self-injurious behaviors (SIB) are elevated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related genetic disorders, but the genetic and biological mechanisms that contribute to SIB in ASD are poorly understood.

Current SIB were reported in 30% of participants and associated with poorer cognitive and adaptive skills. History of severe abdominal pain predicted higher rates of SIB and SIB severity after controlling for age and adaptive behavior; individuals with a history of severe abdominal pain were eight times more likely to exhibit SIB than those with no history.

The core conceptualization of ASD as a spectrum of developmental disorders impacting cognitive, social, and behavioral functions appears consistent across both texts, despite the different specific aspects each addresses. Thus, the semantic usage of ""autism spectrum disorder"" remains stable with no significant drift in its meaning over the presented time periods."
19,Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism is reaching epidemic proportions. The diagnosis can be made as early as 2 years of age, and autistic patients are expected to have a normal life span. Thus, in terms of the number of 'patient years', autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a market that is as large as that of the biggest neurological indication, Alzheimer's disease. However, despite the clear unmet medical need no effective treatment is yet available. This could be because the biology of ASD is not clearly understood and thus proper drug treatment has not been possible. However, significant advances are being made toward understanding the mechanisms of the disease. Here, we review the most recent preclinical advances in the hope that they will lead to a breakthrough in the near future.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder that emerges in the beginning years of life (12-48 months). Yet, an early diagnosis of ASD is challenging as it relies on the consistent presence of behavioral symptomatology, and thus, many children are diagnosed later in development, which prevents early interventions that could benefit cognitive and social outcomes. As a result, there is growing interest in detecting early brain markers of ASD, such as in the electroencephalogram (EEG) to elucidate divergence in early development. Here, we examine the EEG of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the transition from infancy to toddlerhood, a period of rapid development and pronounced changes in early brain function. NREM features exhibit clear developmental trajectories, are related to social and cognitive development, and may be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, spectral features of NREM sleep are poorly understood in infants/toddlers with or at high risk for ASD.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" refers to a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a range of symptoms impacting social interaction and cognitive function, recognized earliest in the childhood years (typically 12-48 months as noted in Text B). The descriptions in both texts emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, the challenges associated with understanding the disorder's biological underpinnings, and the continuing focus on research for better outcomes and interventions. There is no significant shift in the essential meaning or connotation of the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" between the two texts, as both address it from a clinical and developmental perspective, focusing on the same core attributes of ASD. Hence, the semantic meaning of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" remains consistent over the years covered by the texts."
20,Autism spectrum disorder,"We are on the brink of exciting discoveries into the molecular genetic underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder. Overwhelming evidence of genetic involvement coupled with increased societal attention to the disorder has drawn in more researchers and more research funding. Autism is a strongly genetic yet strikingly complex disorder, in which evidence from different cases supports chromosomal disorders, rare single gene mutations, and multiplicative effects of common gene variants. With more and more interesting yet sometimes divergent findings emerging every year, it is tempting to view these initial molecular studies as so much noise, but the data have also started to coalesce in certain areas. In particular, recent studies in families with autism spectrum disorder have identified uncommon occurrences of a novel genetic syndrome caused by disruptions of the NLGN4 gene on chromosome Xp22. Previous work had identified another uncommon syndrome that is caused by maternal duplications of the chromosome 15q11-13 region. We highlight other converging findings, point toward those areas most likely to yield results, and emphasize the contributions of multiple approaches to identifying the genes of interest.","Exposure to stressful life events during pregnancy has been suggested as a potential risk factor for offspring Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but the literature is limited and inconsistent. We tested the hypothesis that maternal exposure to stressful life events would be associated with increased risks of offspring ASD, and that these risks would be highest for exposures during the prenatal period.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) retains its primary meaning as a genetic and developmental disorder with strong genetic components and association with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Text A emphasizes the genetic research aspects, discussing gene mutations and chromosomal discrepancies, while Text B focuses on prenatal environmental influences that might affect the risk of developing ASD. Despite the different angles, the core meaning concerning the disorder itself, its genetic roots, and the complex etiology associated with ASD remains consistent between the two texts. The description and understanding of ASD fundamentally remains centered on it being a developmental disorder influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, hence no significant semantic drift is observed."
21,Autism spectrum disorder,"The objective of this review is to clarify the role of matching in family genetic studies of autism as a way of defining endophenotypes for linkage analysis. The concept of a confounding variable is reviewed and the importance of considering these in family studies of three endophenotypes in autism are considered: cognitive/language impairments, psychiatric disorders, and autistic-like traits. The importance of matching in infant sibling studies of autism is also addressed. Matching as a way of dealing with confounding variables has an important impact on understanding the extent to which these phenotypes are associated with the genes that confer susceptibility to autism and to the early detection of the disorder. Matching continues to be an important issue in the planning and conduct of family-genetic studies of the autism spectrum disorders, particularly as the search for autism susceptibility genes enters the next generation of studies.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction skills. Whole exome sequencing has identified loss-of-function mutations in lysine methyltransferase 2E (KMT2E, also named MLL5) in ASD patients and it is listed as an ASD high-risk gene in humans. However, experimental evidence of KMT2E in association with ASD-like manifestations or neuronal function is still missing. Relying on KMT2E","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) is consistently used to describe a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by various impairments, including social interaction skills and cognitive/language difficulties. Text A focuses more on the genetic research aspects and matching confounding variables in studies, while Text B elaborates on genetic mutations associated with ASD and their effects on neurodevelopment. Despite the advancements in understanding specific genetic factors and methodologies over the years, the underlying concept of ASD as a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders remains consistent between Text A and Text B. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" between the two texts."
22,Autism spectrum disorder,To estimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among adult psychiatric out-patients; to evaluate the efficacy of a new brief screening questionnaire (ASDASQ).," Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a syndrome of social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors or restrictive interests. It remains a behaviorally defined syndrome with no reliable biological markers. The goal of this review is to summarize the available neuroimaging data and examine their implication for our understanding of the neurobiology of ASD.Although there is variability in the literature on structural magnetic resonance literature (MRI), there is evidence of volume abnormalities in both grey and white matter, with a suggestion of some region-specific differences. Early brain overgrowth is probably the most replicated finding in a subgroup of people with ASD, and new techniques, such as cortical-thickness measurements and surface morphometry have begun to elucidate in more detail the patterns of abnormalities as they evolve with age, and are implicating specific neuroanatomical or neurodevelopmental processes. Functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging techniques suggest that such volume abnormalities are associated with atypical functional and structural connectivity in the brain, and researchers have begun to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques to explore the neurochemical substrate of such abnormalities. The data from multiple imaging methods suggests that ASD is associated with an atypically connected brain. We now need to further clarify such atypicalities, and start interpreting them in the context of what we already know about typical neurodevelopmental processes including migration and organization of the cortex. Such an approach will allow us to relate imaging findings not only to behavior, but also to genes and their expression, which may be related to such processes, and to further our understanding of the nature of neurobiologic abnormalities in ASD.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" maintains a consistent meaning related to a behavioral and neurally distinct category. Both texts discuss the condition in the context of its manifestations and implications for research or diagnostics. Text A focuses on screening among psychiatric out-patients and aims to estimate prevalence, while Text B gives a more detailed exploration into the neurobiology through imaging and neurochemistry, yet still framing ASD as a condition defined by social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and restrictive interests. Although the depth and scope of discussion vary, with Text B going into greater neurobiological detail, the fundamental concept of ASD as a behavioral and developmental disorder remains consistent between the two texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" between the periods covered by the two texts.

23,Autism spectrum disorder,To examine the relationship between autism spectrum disorders and low body weight.,"One of the defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is difficulty with language and communication.(1) Children with ASD's onset of speaking is usually delayed, and many children with ASD consistently produce language less frequently and of lower lexical and grammatical complexity than their typically developing (TD) peers.(6,8,12,23) However, children with ASD also exhibit a significant social deficit, and researchers and clinicians continue to debate the extent to which the deficits in social interaction account for or contribute to the deficits in language production.(5,14,19,25) Standardized assessments of language in children with ASD usually do include a comprehension component; however, many such comprehension tasks assess just one aspect of language (e.g., vocabulary),(5) or include a significant motor component (e.g., pointing, act-out), and/or require children to deliberately choose between a number of alternatives. These last two behaviors are known to also be challenging to children with ASD.(7,12,13,16) We present a method which can assess the language comprehension of young typically developing children (9-36 months) and children with autism.(2,4,9,11,22) This method, Portable Intermodal Preferential Looking (P-IPL), projects side-by-side video images from a laptop onto a portable screen. The video images are paired first with a 'baseline' (nondirecting) audio, and then presented again paired with a 'test' linguistic audio that matches only one of the video images. Children's eye movements while watching the video are filmed and later coded. Children who understand the linguistic audio will look more quickly to, and longer at, the video that matches the linguistic audio.(2,4,11,18,22,26) This paradigm includes a number of components that have recently been miniaturized (projector, camcorder, digitizer) to enable portability and easy setup in children's homes. This is a crucial point for assessing young children with ASD, who are frequently uncomfortable in new (e.g., laboratory) settings. Videos can be created to assess a wide range of specific components of linguistic knowledge, such as Subject-Verb-Object word order, wh-questions, and tense/aspect suffixes on verbs; videos can also assess principles of word learning such as a noun bias, a shape bias, and syntactic bootstrapping.(10,14,17,21,24) Videos include characters and speech that are visually and acoustically salient and well tolerated by children with ASD.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) is used within the context of understanding specific characteristics and implications for individuals diagnosed with this condition. Text A mentions the relationship between ASD and low body weight, which addresses a health-related aspect of individuals with ASD. Text B discusses language and communication difficulties, social deficits, and methods for assessing language comprehension in children with ASD. Although the specific focus and details in each text are different, with Text A discussing a more general physical health aspect and Text B diving deeply into communication-related challenges and assessment methods, both texts use ""autism spectrum disorder"" within the framework of describing the conditions associated with ASD, its challenges, and methodologies for better understanding or evaluating these challenges.

Thus, the underlying definition and conceptual understanding of what ""autism spectrum disorder"" means remains consistent between the two texts, focusing on a range of developmental issues associated with ASD, without any significant shift in the term's meaning or connotation over the periods described. Therefore, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
24,Autism spectrum disorder,"The Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) was used as a screening instrument in a study of autism spectrum disorders in a population of children with mental retardation or physical disability or both. The ABC score clearly reflected behavioural problems found in children with mental retardation and not only behaviours typical of autism. If the cut-off score used was 45 (lower than recommended by the original investigators), children with autistic disorder without multiple other disabilities were reliably identified, with an acceptable rate of false positive cases. In order not to miss other autism spectrum disorders, all cases with several omitted items in their checklists were examined in more detail. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) distinguished reasonably well between autistic disorder and other autism spectrum disorders.","Excessive inflammation has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully studied.

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" is primarily focused on behavioral aspects and diagnostic tools in assessing and categorizing autism relative to mental retardation and other disabilities in a clinical and educational context. It highlights the diversity within the spectrum in terms of behavioral manifestations and the differentiation among the disorders within the spectrum. In Text B, on the other hand, the context shifts significantly towards a biological and genetic understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The emphasis is on the pathological role of inflammation and genetic mutations impacting brain function, specifically pointing to synaptic proteins. This suggests a major shift from a behavioral and symptomatic view to a deeper biomedical and genetic perspective, highlighting the developmental and neurobiological complexities that have gained more focus in contemporary research. The semantic content around ASD has expanded to include more detailed underlying biological processes beyond the observational behavioral symptoms."
25,Autism spectrum disorder,"Many students with autism spectrum disorders show good decoding combined with poor comprehension. Twenty adolescent students with autism spectrum disorders participated in a study concerning the effects of three kinds of facilitation on reading comprehension. In a within-subjects design, each students read passages under four conditions: answering prereading questions, completing cloze sentences embedded in the text, resolving anaphora by identifying relevant antecedents, and control (reading only). A repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that conditions differed significantly in their effects on reading comprehension. Post hoc contrasts showed that the effects of anaphoric cuing were statistically significant and medium in size; the effects of prereading questions and cloze completion were small and not statistically significant. Instructional implications for text preparation, remedial instruction, and the design of educational software are discussed.","IMMP2L, the gene encoding the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 2-like protein, has been reported as a candidate gene for Tourette syndrome, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and additional neurodevelopmental disorders.

We have conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to quantify the association of IMMP2L deletions with ASD using 5,568 cases and 10,279 controls. While the IMMP2L deletions carried non-recurrent breakpoints, in contrast to previous reports, our meta-analysis found no evidence of association (P > 0.05) between IMMP2L deletions and ASD. We also observed common exonic deletions impacting IMMP2L in a separate control (5,971 samples) cohort where subjects were screened for psychiatric conditions. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the effect of IMMP2L deletions on ASD, but further investigations in different populations, especially Chinese population may be still needed to confirm our results.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) refers consistently to a specific category of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by varying degrees and manifestations of social, communicative, and behavioral challenges. Text A discusses interventions aimed at improving reading comprehension among students with ASD, while Text B examines genetic research related to ASD, specifically the investigation of genetic deletions and their association with the disorder. While the focus of the texts differ—one being educational interventions and the other genetic research—the underlying concept and definition of ""autism spectrum disorder"" as a medical and developmental condition remains unchanged across both texts."
26,Autism spectrum disorder,"Comorbidity is the rule, not the exception, in bipolar disorder. The most common mental disorders that co-occur with bipolar disorder in community studies include anxiety, substance use, and conduct disorders. Disorders of eating, sexual behavior, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and impulse control, as well as autism spectrum disorders and Tourette's disorder, co-occur with bipolar disorder in clinical samples. The most common general medical comorbidities are migraine, thyroid illness, obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Bipolarity is a marker for comorbidity, and comorbid disorders, especially multiple conditions occurring when a patient is young, may be a marker for bipolarity. Relatively few controlled clinical studies have examined the treatment of bipolar disorder in the context of comorbid conditions (i.e., complicated or comorbid bipolar disorder). However, the first step in treating any type of complicated bipolar disorder--stabilizing a patient's mood--may be associated with improving the comorbid disorder. Standard mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and non-antimanic antiepileptic agents are emerging as potentially useful treatments for several of the disorders that frequently co-occur with bipolar disorder, and therefore may be useful treatments for comorbid bipolar disorder.","This study examined waiting times for diagnostic assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder in 11 adult services, prior to and following the implementation of a 12 month change program. Methods to support change are reported and a multi-level modelling approach determined the effect of the change program on overall wait times. Results were statistically significant (b = - 0.25, t(136) = - 2.88, p = 0.005). The average time individuals waited for diagnosis across all services reduced from 149.4 days prior to the change program and 119.5 days after it, with an average reduction of 29.9 days overall.

27,Autism spectrum disorder,"Providing intensive early intervention is critical to maximizing outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and evidence suggests that the earlier intervention can begin, the better the outcome. The first purpose of this article is to review the earliest indicators of ASD in very young children-social and communication impairments-which have important implications for early identification. The second purpose is to review evidence-based intervention practices for children with ASD and to develop a set of guiding principles for providing intervention for infants and toddlers who are at risk for ASD. Issues that are delineated include providing intervention in natural environments, supporting families in early intervention, and embedding intervention in daily routines.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core sociocommunicative impairments. Atypical intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) has been reported in numerous studies of ASD. A majority of findings has indicated long-distance underconnectivity. However, fMRI studies have thus far exclusively examined static iFC across several minutes of scanning. We examined temporal variability of iFC, using sliding window analyses in selected high-quality (low-motion) consortium datasets from 76 ASD and 76 matched typically developing (TD) participants (Study 1) and in-house data from 32 ASD and 32 TD participants. Mean iFC and standard deviation of the sliding window correlation (SD-iFC) were computed for regions of interest (ROIs) from default mode and salience networks, as well as amygdala and thalamus. In both studies, ROI pairings with significant underconnectivity (ASD<TD) were identified. Mediation analyses showed that decreased mean iFC in the ASD groups was significantly affected by increased SD-iFC. Our study is the first to identify temporal variability across time as a significant contributing factor to the common finding of static underconnectivity in ASD. Since peak connectivity across time was not significantly reduced in ASD, static underconnectivity findings may have to be reinterpreted, suggesting that connections are not actually ""broken"" in ASD, but subject to greater intra-individual variability across time. Our findings indicate the need for dynamic approaches to iFC in clinical functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) investigations.","###Answer:

28,Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism is a behaviorally defined disorder characterized by a broad constellation of symptoms. Numerous studies directed to the biological substrate demonstrate clear effects of neurodevelopmental differences that will likely point to the etiology, course, and long-term outcomes of the disorder. Consistently replicated research on the neural underpinnings of autism is reviewed. In general, results suggest several main conclusions: First, autism is a heterogeneous disorder and is likely to have multiple possible etiologies; second, structural brain studies have indicated a variety of diffuse anatomical differences, reflective of an early developmental change in the growth or pruning of neural tissue, rather than localized lesions; similarly, neurochemical studies suggest early, neuromodulatory discrepancies rather than gross or localized abnormalities; and finally, there are a number of limitations on studies of brain activity that to date preclude definitive answers to questions of how the brain functions differently in autism.

In Text B, however, the focus shifts significantly toward the genetic foundations of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It talks about the genetic factors, identifying specific genes that could be linked to ASD through various genetic variations such as CNVs and single nucleotide variations. This represents a more biomedical and genetic approach to understanding the disorder, diverging from the cognitive and behavioral emphasis seen in Text A.

30,Autism spectrum disorder,"15q11- q13 contains many imprinted genes, and undergoes duplicon-mediated rearrangements, including deletions, duplications and triplications, and generation of marker chromosomes. Abnormal phenotypes, including language delays and autism spectrum disorders, are primarily observed with maternal 15q11- q13 duplication. To determine possible epigenetic effects on expression within duplicated 15q11- q13 regions, we utilized RNA-FISH to directly observe gene expression. RNA-FISH, unlike RT-PCR, is polymorphism-independent, and it also detects relative levels of expression at each allele. Unamplified, gene-specific RNA signals were detected using cDNA probes. Subsequent DNA-FISH confirmed RNA signals and assigned parental origin by colocalization of genomic probes. SNRPN and NDN expression was detected primarily from paternal alleles. Control Dystrobrevin transcripts were detected equally from both alleles; however, maternal-UBE3A signals were consistently larger than paternal signals in normal fibroblasts and in neural-precursor cells. Larger UBE3A signals were also observed on one or both maternal alleles in a cell line carrying a maternal interstitial duplication, on both alleles of a maternally derived marker(15) chromosome, and occasionally on a paternal allele in a cell line carrying a paternal interstitial duplication. Expression of NDNL2, just distal to the duplicated region, was not markedly altered but paralleled changes in UBE3A expression. Excess total maternal-UBE3A RNA was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of cell lines carrying 15q11- q13 duplications or triplications. These results demonstrate that: (1) UBE3A is imprinted in fibroblasts, lymphoblasts and neural-precursor cells; (2) allelic imprint status is maintained in the majority of cells upon duplication both in cis and in trans; and (3) alleles on specific types of duplications may exhibit an increase in expression levels/loss of expression constraints.","Mutations in the postsynaptic scaffolding gene SHANK2 have recently been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. However, the cellular and physiological consequences of these mutations in neurons remain unknown. We have analyzed the functional impact caused by two inherited and one de novo SHANK2 mutations from ASD individuals (L1008_P1009dup, T1127M, R462X). Although all three variants affect spine volume and have smaller SHANK2 cluster sizes, T1127M additionally fails to rescue spine volume in Shank2 knock-down neurons. R462X is not able to rescue spine volume and dendritic branching and lacks postsynaptic clustering, indicating the most severe dysfunction. To demonstrate that R462X when expressed in mouse can be linked to physiological effects, we analyzed synaptic transmission and behavior. Principal neurons of mice expressing rAAV-transduced SHANK2-R462X present a specific, long-lasting reduction in miniature postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents. This dominant negative effect translates into dose-dependent altered cognitive behavior of SHANK2-R462X-expressing mice, with an impact on the penetrance of ASD.","###Answer:

31,Autism spectrum disorder,Autism is a heterogeneous pervasive developmental disorder with a poorly defined aetiology and pathophysiology. There are indications that the incidence of the disease is rising but still no definitive diagnostic biochemical markers have been isolated. Here we have addressed the hypothesis that urinary levels of trans -indolyl-3-acryloylglycine (IAG) are abnormal in patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) compared to age-matched controls.,"Copy number variants are deletions and duplications of a few thousand to million base pairs and are associated with extraordinarily high levels of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The unprecedented levels of robust and reproducible penetrance of copy number variants make them one of the most promising and reliable entry points to delve into the mechanistic bases of many mental disorders. However, the precise mechanistic bases of these associations still remain elusive in humans due to the many genes encoded in each copy number variant and the diverse associated phenotypic features. Genetically engineered mice have provided a technical means to ascertain precise genetic mechanisms of association between copy number variants and dimensional aspects of mental illnesses. Molecular, cellular, and neuronal phenotypes can be detected as potential mechanistic substrates for various behavioral constructs of mental illnesses. However, mouse models come with many technical pitfalls. Genetic background is not well controlled in many mouse models, leading to rather obvious interpretative issues. Dose alterations of many copy number variants and single genes within copy number variants result in some molecular, cellular, and neuronal phenotypes without a behavioral phenotype or with a behavioral phenotype opposite to what is seen in humans. In this review, I discuss technical and interpretative pitfalls of mouse models of copy number variants and highlight well-controlled studies to suggest potential neuronal mechanisms of dimensional aspects of mental illnesses. Mouse models of copy number variants represent toeholds to achieve a better understanding of the mechanistic bases of dimensions of neuropsychiatric disorders and thus for development of mechanism-based therapeutic options in humans.","- Label: Changed

32,Autism spectrum disorder,"The aim of this paper is to provoke discussion concerning the nature of the cognitive impairments that characterize autism. Autism spectrum disorders appear to be heterogeneous at the biological and behavioural levels, but it is currently unclear whether one or more cognitive abnormalities may be universal to people with autism. In addition, it is unknown whether one cognitive deficit is primary and causal, or whether several complimentary accounts are needed to explain the full range of behavioural features. From research to date, it seems that the psychological abnormalities that characterize autism may be dissociable, and it is uncertain whether the degree of social and non-social impairments is related. Possible reasons for the co-occurrence of social and non-social cognitive abnormalities in autism are discussed. One implication is that searching for the biological bases of specific social and non-social deficits may be more profitable than searching for the aetiology of autism per se.","The exact cause and mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear.

Thus, the fundamental conceptualization and use of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" as a complex, multi-faceted medical condition remain consistent across the two texts despite their different emphases on aspects of research and understanding of the disorder."
33,Autism spectrum disorder,"A polymorphic trinucleotide repeat (CGG/GCC) within the human Reelin gene (RELN) was examined as a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This gene encodes a large extracellular matrix protein that orchestrates neuronal positioning during corticogenesis. The CGG-repeat within the 5' untranslated region of RELN exon 1 was examined in 126 multiple-incidence families. The number of CGG repeats varied from three to 16 in affected individuals and controls, with no expansion or contraction observed during maternal (n = 291) or paternal (n = 287) transmissions in families with autistic probands. Although the frequencies of the RELN alleles and genotypes in affected children were not different from those in the comparison group, a family-based association test (FBAT) showed that the larger RELN alleles (> or = 11 repeats) were transmitted more often than expected to affected children (S = 43, E(S) = 34.5, P = 0.035); this was particularly the case for the 13-repeat RELN allele (S = 22, E(S) = 16, P = 0.034). Affected sib-pair (ASP) analysis found no evidence of excess sharing of RELN alleles in affected siblings. The impact of genotypes with large alleles (> or = 11 repeats) on the phenotypes in individuals with ASD was analyzed by ANOVA in a subset of the families for which results of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were available. Children with large RELN alleles did not show any difference in scores for questions related to the core symptoms of autistic disorder, but there was a tendency for children with at least one large RELN allele to have an earlier age at first phrase (chi(2) = 3.538, P = 0.06). Thus, although the case-control and affected sib-pair findings did not support a role for RELN in susceptibility to ASD, the more powerful family-based association study demonstrated that RELN alleles with larger numbers of CGG repeats may play a role in the etiology of some cases of ASD, especially in children without delayed phrase speech.","This study was performed to determine (a) the age at which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is first diagnosed in Ugandan children receiving mental health services, (b) whether age at diagnosis varies by sex and clinical presentation, and (c) the average age of ASD diagnosis in children manifesting comorbid conditions. A retrospective chart review was performed and demographic as well as clinical data were collected from children with ASD diagnoses who attended two mental health clinics in Uganda between 2014 and 2019. Descriptive statistics such as percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to summarize the data. Independent t-test was also performed to determine differences in the mean age of diagnosis between males and females. Two hundred and thirty-seven (156 males, 81 females) children with ASD were identified. The average age of ASD diagnosis was (6.9 ± 4.0) years. A statistically significant difference in age of ASD diagnosis was found between males and females (t = -2.106, p = 0.036), such that on average females received a diagnosis at least 1 year later than males. Of the 237 participants, 53.6% were identified with ASD only, 16.0% had ASD and ADHD, 10.5% were diagnosed with ASD and epilepsy, and 7.2% had a diagnosis of complex ASD. The results confirm delays in access to ASD diagnosis and suggest that females are more likely to receive a ASD diagnosis later than males within the Ugandan context. ASD awareness should be intensified to improve public or professional knowledge about ASD to enhance early identification in Uganda.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) retains the same fundamental meaning; it refers to a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. 

- **Text A** primarily investigates the genetic aspects of ASD, focussing on the RELN gene and its potential association with ASD. It explores if certain genetic markers within the RELN gene could be influential in ASD development, particularly in relation to speech delay, suggesting a biological perspective in understanding the disorder.
  
- **Text B** approaches ASD from an epidemiological and sociocultural perspective, looking at the average age of diagnosis among children in a specific demographic (Uganda), factors influencing delays in diagnosis, and differences in diagnosis by gender. This text emphasizes public health and accessibility issues impacting ASD diagnosis and awareness.

Both texts, despite their different focuses - genetic research versus clinical and demographic - align in their understanding and framing of ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder. The core concept of ASD does not exhibit a shift in definition or connotation between the two texts, instead showing continuity in its interpretation across different domains (genetic research and public health). Thus, the semantic meaning of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" appears unchanged between the two texts."
34,Autism spectrum disorder,"Children with autism have an increased risk for obstetric complications but it is not known whether these are of primary aetiological significance. It is also unclear whether obstetric complications play a secondary role in shaping phenotypic expression in individuals at genetic risk for autism. We investigated this question by studying the role of obstetric complications in determining phenotypic manifestations in tuberous sclerosis, a single gene disorder frequently associated with autism spectrum disorders. Obstetric histories of 43 children with non-familial TS and 40 unaffected siblings were obtained using a structured parent interview. ADI-R, ADOS-G and IQ evaluations were undertaken. Children with TS experienced more obstetric complications than their unaffected siblings, but these were related to mild rather than severe adversities. No differences in obstetric complications were found in children with and without autism spectrum disorders and there was no positive correlation between obstetric adversities and severity of autism spectrum disorders or intellectual impairments.","Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating brain disease that affects about 1% of world population. Among the top genetic associations, zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene encodes a zinc finger protein, associated with SZ and biolar disorder (BD). Copy number variants (CNVs) of ZNF804A have been observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), anxiety disorder, and BD, suggesting that ZNF804A is a dosage sensitive gene for brain development. However, its molecular functions have not been fully determined. Our previous interactomic study revealed that ZNF804A interacts with multiple proteins to control protein translation and neural development. ZNF804A is localized in the cytoplasm and neurites in the human cortex and is expressed in various types of neurons, including pyramidal, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and Purkinje neurons in mouse brain. To further examine the effect of gene dosage of ZNF804A on neurite morphology, both knockdown and overexpression of ZNF804A in primary neuronal cells significantly attenuate dendritic complex and spine formation. To determine the factors mediating these phenotypes, interestingly, three binding proteins of ZNF804A, galectin 1 (LGALS1), fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) and ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), show different effects on reversing the deficits. LGALS1 and FEZ1 stimulate neurite outgrowth at basal level but RPSA shows no effect. Intriguingly, LGALS1 but not FEZ1, reverses the neurite outgrowth deficits induced by ZNF804A knockdown. However, FEZ1 and RPSA but not LGALS1, can ameliorate ZNF804A overexpression-mediated dendritic abnormalities. Thus, our results uncover a critical post-mitotic role of ZNF804A in neurite and synaptic development relevant to neurodevelopmental pathologies.","- Label: Unchanged

35,Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism is a developmental disease usually manifesting within the first three years of life. To date, no causative agent has been found. Similarly, treatment options have been limited. Of the treatment options available, a number of them have been nutritionally based in an attempt to address one or more of the theories regarding the etiology of the disease. An example would be enzyme therapy for the digestion of purported offending neuroactive peptides collectively known as exorphins. This paper discusses the exorphin theory of autism and subsequent treatment with dietary enzyme therapy. Novel data are presented in support of the theory that enzymes play a critical role in autism. Forty-six patients between the ages of 5 and 31 were selected for inclusion in the study based on a diagnosis placing them in the category of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The diets were supplemented with a novel dietary enzyme formulation, ENZYMAID, for a period of 12 weeks. Progress was tracked according to the Symptom Outcome Survey (SOS) (1) form method of symptom charting and presented in a table for further analysis. The novel enzyme formula, ENZYMAID, beneficially and safely affected all 13 of the parameters measured. Improvements ranged from 50-90%, depending on the parameter measured. Enzyme therapy to treat ASD may indeed a viable option in treatment protocols. These results indicate that further controlled studies are warranted.","Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder for which the cause and treatment have yet not been determined. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels change rapidly in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of autistic children and PUFAs are closely related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This finding suggests that changes in lipid metabolism are associated with ASD and result in an altered distribution of phospholipids in cell membranes. To further understand ASD, it is necessary to analyze phospholipids in organs consisting of nerve cells, such as the brain. In this study, we investigated the phospholipid distribution in the brain tissue of valproic acid-induced autistic mice using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine were identified in each brain region and exhibited differences between the ASD and control groups. These phospholipids contain docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, which are important PUFAs for cell signaling and brain growth. We expect that the differences in phospholipids identified in the brain tissue of the ASD model with MALDI-MSI, in conjunction with conventional biological fluid analysis, will help to better understand changes in lipid metabolism in ASD.","###Label:

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) is used consistently to refer to a neurodevelopmental disorder with varied manifestations and unclear etiology. Text A from an earlier time primarily focuses on treatment using enzyme therapy, linking autism's symptoms with nutritional and biochemical theories. Text B from a later date continues to discuss autism as a developmental disorder, focusing on biochemical insights through the study of lipid metabolism in the brain. Both texts explore ASD in the context of biological and chemical processes affecting the brain and behavior, maintaining the core concept of autism as a neurodevelopmental condition. Thus, the semantic usage of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" has not significantly changed between the two texts; rather, the exploration of its underlying mechanisms and potential treatments has evolved."
36,Autism spectrum disorder,"This article describes the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) manifested by 405 individuals between the ages of 10 and 53 years, all of whom had an ASD diagnosis. Data were collected using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to assess the pattern of autism symptoms in adolescence and adulthood. Findings include that although virtually all sample members met the criteria for Autistic Disorder earlier in their childhood, just over half (54.8%) would have met autism criteria if current scores were used to complete the diagnostic algorithm; that adolescents were more likely to improve in the Reciprocal Social Interaction domain than the adults, whereas the adults were more likely to improve in the Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors and Interests domain, and there were no differences in severity of symptoms between cohorts in the Communication domain; and that individual symptoms showed unique trajectories, with greatest symptom abatement between lifetime and current ADI-R ratings for speaking in at least three-word phrases and the least symptom improvement for having friendships. Findings were interpreted in the context of life course development, reformulations of diagnostic criteria, and changing service contexts for individuals with autism spectrum disorders.","An altered pattern of information processing has been hypothesized in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by enhanced local network connectivity and reduced long-distance communication. Previous findings of impaired white matter integrity in the genu and the body of the corpus callosum already indicated reduced long-distance connectivity in patients with ASD. However, it remained unclear how this reduced white matter integrity affects the structural connectivity of the corresponding brain areas. To this end, we analyzed magnetic resonance images (MRI) from 30 participants with high-functioning ASD and 30 typically developed individuals using a global tracking approach to estimate the fiber count and volume of the transcallosal fiber tracts of the five corpus callosum subsections. A reduced fiber count and fiber volume in the anterior subsection of the corpus callosum was detected, supporting the hypothesis of reduced long-distance connectivity in ASD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" retains a consistent use and understanding related to a neurological and developmental disorder marked by a variety of symptoms, including difficulties in social interaction and communication skills. Text A discusses the symptoms and developmental changes of individuals diagnosed with ASD over time using a psychological and observational framework, while Text B explores the biological and neurological underpinnings of ASD, particularly focusing on brain connectivity and structural differences. Despite the different approaches (observational vs. neurological) in discussing ASD, the core meaning and context of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" concerning a defined range of psychological and neurodevelopmental conditions remain consistent. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" between the two texts."
37,Autism spectrum disorder,"The Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF) is a behavior rating scale designed for children and adolescents with mental retardation. The purpose of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of the NCBRF in a sample of 330 children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Parent and teacher ratings were independently submitted to both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. As reported with the original validation study, parent and teacher versions shared similar but somewhat different factor structures. Social competence items showed more similarity with the original solutions than did problem behavior items. Problem behavior items were distributed into a somewhat simpler five-factor solution for both rating forms. Self-injurious and stereotypic items loaded on two distinct subscales for the teacher form, but not on the parent form. Factor loadings and internal consistencies were generally lower than those reported for the original versions but still within the acceptable range. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated good fits for the social competence items and acceptable fits for the problem behavior items. Overall, results supported the construct validity of the NCBRF in children and adolescents with ASDs.","Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, have been intensively investigated at the neural, cognitive, and behavioral levels, but the accumulated knowledge remains fragmented. In particular, developmental learning aspects of symptoms and interactions with the physical environment remain largely unexplored in computational modeling studies, although a leading computational theory has posited associations between psychiatric symptoms and an unusual estimation of information uncertainty (precision), which is an essential aspect of the real world and is estimated through learning processes.

38,Autism spectrum disorder,"The hypothesis of an immune dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders has previously been put forward without, however, compelling evidence of a direct relation to its etiology or pathogenesis. To further understand if autoimmunity could play a significant role in autism, we analyzed autoantibody repertoires to brain tissue extract in the plasma of 171 autism children, their parents, and 54 controls, by quantitative immunoblotting. Multiparametric analysis revealed significant differences between patients and controls, and showed that one single reactivity in Section 32 of the blot had the most power to discriminate between these samples. Family correlation coefficients and heritability estimates did not provide any evidence that this reactivity was genetically determined. While the molecular weight of the target protein suggested that it might be an isoform of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), inhibition assays with human MBP argued against this hypothesis. The study evidences the widespread occurrence of autoreactivities to brain tissue in autism patients, which may represent the immune system's neuroprotective response to a previous brain injury occurred during neurodevelopment. The molecular identification of the target protein in Section 32 will contribute to the understanding of the role of immune responses against brain antigens in autistic patients.","This article addresses the issue of integration of routine screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in pediatric primary care.

In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the development of striatal neurons and associated circuits with a focus on their embryonic origin. Specifically, we address the role of distinct types of embryonic progenitors, found in the proliferative zones of the ganglionic eminences in the ventral telencephalon, in the generation of diverse striatal interneurons and projection neurons. Indeed, recent evidence would suggest that embryonic progenitor origin dictates key characteristics of postnatal cells, including their neurochemical content, their location within striatum, and their long-range synaptic inputs. We also integrate recent observations regarding embryonic progenitors in cortical and other regions and discuss how this might inform future research on the ganglionic eminences.

Text B touches upon the co-occurrence of gender variance or gender dysphoria with autism spectrum disorder in clinical settings, incorporating considerations of gender but still focusing on the core behavioral and developmental characteristics of ASD. Although Text B introduces an intersection with gender issues, the essential medical/developmental understanding of ASD remains consistent between the two texts.

In Text B, from a more recent period, the focus shifts to the psychological impact and the interrelation between ASD and common mental health issues like anxiety and depression. It discusses the need for valid measures for anxiety and depression in the ASD population, indicating a broader, more holistic perspective on the emotional and psychological needs of individuals with ASD rather than purely focusing on diagnostic categorization.

These shifts suggest a semantic drift where ASD is increasingly discussed not just in the context of diagnostic classification but also considering the broader psychological wellbeing and co-occurring mental health conditions of individuals.

This paper outlines a model process for school personnel to develop a basic level of training and competence in recognizing and serving students who have an ASD by (1) providing an overview of the legal and clinical issues involved in screening for children with ASD within the school system, (2) defining a school-based professional training process and (3) outlining a school-based ASD screening process.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction. Since its discovery as a major functional brain system, the default mode network (DMN) has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders, including ASD. Here we review converging multimodal evidence for DMN dysfunction in the context of specific components of social cognitive dysfunction in ASD: 'self-referential processing' - the ability to process social information relative to oneself and 'theory of mind' or 'mentalizing' - the ability to infer the mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions of others. We show that altered functional and structural organization of the DMN, and its atypical developmental trajectory, are prominent neurobiological features of ASD. We integrate findings on atypical cytoarchitectonic organization and imbalance in excitatory-inhibitory circuits, which alter local and global brain signaling, to scrutinize putative mechanisms underlying DMN dysfunction in ASD. Our synthesis of the extant literature suggests that aberrancies in key nodes of the DMN and their dynamic functional interactions contribute to atypical integration of information about the self in relation to 'other', as well as impairments in the ability to flexibly attend to socially relevant stimuli. We conclude by highlighting open questions for future research.","- Label: Unchanged

47,Autism spectrum disorder,"An investigation is described which forms the basis for the development of an information package for the Asian carers of people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and learning disabilities. The results of semi-structured interviews and planning for questionnaires with three different linguistic Asian groups (Urdu, Gujarati and Bengali) are presented. The views, attitudes and awareness of autism, knowledge of support services and perceived priority of needs are analysed for the three different communities. The investigation concludes with recommendations as to whether separate information is needed by each culture or whether a single information pack can be used and presented in each language format. The possible presentation format in which the information can be produced is also discussed.","AutDB is a deeply annotated resource for exploring the impact of genetic variations associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). First released in 2007, AutDB has evolved into a multi-modular resource of diverse types of genetic and functional evidence related to ASD. Current modules include: Human Gene, which annotates all ASD-linked genes and their variants; Animal Model, which catalogs behavioral, anatomical and physiological data from rodent models of ASD; Protein Interaction (PIN), which builds interactomes from direct relationships of protein products of ASD genes; and Copy Number Variant (CNV), which catalogs deletions and duplications of chromosomal loci identified in ASD. A multilevel data-integration strategy is utilized to connect the ASD genes to the components of the other modules. All information in this resource is manually curated by expert scientists from primary scientific publications and is referenced to source articles. AutDB is actively maintained with a rigorous quarterly data release schedule. As of June 2017, AutDB contains detailed annotations for 910 genes, 2197 CNV loci, 1060 rodent models and 38 296 PINs. With its widespread use by the research community, AutDB serves as a reference resource for analysis of large datasets, accelerating ASD research and potentially leading to targeted drug treatments.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) maintains a similar semantic concept relating to a developmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Text A focuses on understanding and addressing the needs of specific cultural groups caring for individuals with ASD. It emphasizes community awareness and support mechanisms. Text B, although it dives into the genetic and research aspects of ASD, still fundamentally refers to it in context as a complex, inheritable, and developmental disorder. Both texts, albeit addressing different aspects (cultural awareness and genetic research), treat ASD with a consistent underlying definition and use the term to refer to the same medical and developmental condition. Therefore, the meaning of ""autism spectrum disorder"" remains unchanged across the two contexts and periods."
48,Autism spectrum disorder,"Thirty-five children who received an autism spectrum diagnosis at the age of 2 years (24 with autism, 11 with PDD-NOS) were re-evaluated 2 years later to examine factors related to the development of spoken language. Child variables (play level, motor imitation ability and joint attention) and environmental variables (socioeconomic status and hours of speech/language therapy between ages 2 and 3) were used to predict an aggregate measure of language outcome at age 4. After controlling for age 2 language skills, the only significant predictors were motor imitation and number of hours of speech/language therapy. Implications of these results for understanding the early developmental course of autism spectrum disorders and the effects of intervention are discussed.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a growing prevalence of sleep problems associated with significant behavioral problems and more severe autism clinical presentation. Little is known about the relationships between autism traits and sleep problems in Hong Kong. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether children with autism have increased sleep problems than non-autistic children in Hong Kong. The secondary objective was to examine the factors associated with sleep problems in an autism clinical sample.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" refers consistently to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a spectrum of symptoms impacting communication and social interaction across both contexts. Text A focuses on predictive factors and language outcomes in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, while Text B explores the prevalence of sleep problems associated with autism spectrum disorder in a different demographic. Despite these different focal points, the core understanding and representation of the disorder as a broad spectrum of related conditions influencing developmental and behavioral aspects remain consistent between the texts. Hence, there's no significant semantic drift in the term between the periods represented by these texts."
49,Autism spectrum disorder,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. It is also one of the most common identifiable causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Carriers of FXS are often considered to be cognitively and behaviorally unaffected. However, we report here on six individuals in the premutation range who also have ASD. A comparison is made with five subjects in the premutation range who did not receive a diagnosis of ASD. The six individuals with ASD had a range of cognitive ability levels from no impairment to moderate retardation. Discussion includes the impact of molecular variables including lowered FMR1 protein and elevated FMR1 mRNA in addition to environmental factors leading to the complex neurodevelopmental disorder of ASD.","Developmental alterations of excitatory synapses are implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here, we report increased dendritic spine density with reduced developmental spine pruning in layer V pyramidal neurons in postmortem ASD temporal lobe. These spine deficits correlate with hyperactivated mTOR and impaired autophagy. In Tsc2 ± ASD mice where mTOR is constitutively overactive, we observed postnatal spine pruning defects, blockade of autophagy, and ASD-like social behaviors. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin corrected ASD-like behaviors and spine pruning defects in Tsc2 ± mice, but not in Atg7(CKO) neuronal autophagy-deficient mice or Tsc2 ± :Atg7(CKO) double mutants. Neuronal autophagy furthermore enabled spine elimination with no effects on spine formation. Our findings suggest that mTOR-regulated autophagy is required for developmental spine pruning, and activation of neuronal autophagy corrects synaptic pathology and social behavior deficits in ASD models with hyperactivated mTOR.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A from an earlier period and Text B from a more recent period, the term ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (ASD) retains a similar meaning and is used to describe a complex neurodevelopmental condition. Text A focuses on the correlation between Fragile X syndrome and ASD, discussing cognitive behavior and genetic factors. Text B continues to explore the biological underpinnings of ASD, mentioning synaptic defects and molecular pathways involved in the disorder. Both texts emphasize the biological and neurological basis of ASD, maintaining consistency in how ASD is characterized as a neurodevelopmental disorder across different research focuses and times."
50,Autism spectrum disorder,"Reports of a relatively high prevalence of absolute pitch (AP) in autistic disorder suggest that AP is associated with some of the distinctive cognitive and social characteristics seen in autism spectrum disorders. Accordingly we examined cognition, personality, social behavior, and language in 13 musicians with strictly defined AP (APS) and 33 musician controls (MC) without AP using standardized interviews and tests previously applied to identify the broad autism phenotype seen in the relatives of autistic probands. These included the Pragmatic Rating Scale (PRS) (social aspects of language) the Personality Assessment Schedule (PAS) (rigidity, aloofness, anxiety/worry, hypersensitivity), and WAIS performance subtests (PIQ). On the basis of their behavior in the interviews, subjects were classified as socially eccentric, somewhat eccentric, or not eccentric. Forty-six percent of the APS, but only 15% of the MC, were classified as socially eccentric (p < .03). APS but not MC showed higher scores on block design than on the other PIQ tests (p < .06), a PIQ pattern seen in autism spectrum disorders. Although APS and MC did not differ significantly on other measures it is of note that APS mean scores on the PRS and PAS (5.69, 4.92) were almost twice as high as those for the MC (3.03, 2.45). Thus, musicians with AP show some of the personality, language, and cognitive features associated with autism. Piecemeal information processing, of which AP is an extreme and rare example, is characteristic of autism and may be associated as well with subclinical variants in language and behavior. We speculate that the gene or genes that underlie AP may be among the genes that contribute to autism.","This study is the first to describe age-related changes in a large cohort of patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome. Over a follow-up period of up to 12 years, physical examinations and structured interviews were conducted for 201 individuals diagnosed with PMS, 120 patients had a focused, high-resolution 22q12q13 array CGH, and 92 patients' deletions were assessed for parent-of-origin. 22q13 genomic anomalies include terminal deletions of 22q13 (89 %), terminal deletions and interstitial duplications (9 %), and interstitial deletions (2 %). Considering different age groups, in older patients, behavioral problems tended to subside, developmental abilities improved, and some features such as large or fleshy hands, full or puffy eyelids, hypotonia, lax ligaments, and hyperextensible joints were less frequent. However, the proportion reporting an autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and cellulitis, or presenting with lymphedema or abnormal reflexes increased with age. Some neurologic and dysmorphic features such as speech and developmental delay and macrocephaly correlated with deletion size. Deletion sizes in more recently diagnosed patients tend to be smaller than those diagnosed a decade earlier. Seventy-three percent of de novo deletions were of paternal origin. Seizures were reported three times more often among patients with a de novo deletion of the maternal rather than paternal chromosome 22. This analysis improves the understanding of the clinical presentation and natural history of PMS and can serve as a reference for the prevalence of clinical features in the syndrome.","###Answer:

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" maintains a consistent usage related to descriptions of behavioral and developmental aspects linked to neurological conditions. Both texts discuss aspects of autism, albeit in different contexts (musicians with absolute pitch and genetic syndromes, respectively), yet the fundamental reference to characteristics associated with autism spectrum disorder remains stable. Text A focuses on the association and cognitive and social patterns occurring in autism spectrum disorders among musicians, emphasizing unusual patterns of cognition and behavior, which are characteristic descriptions of autism. Text B addresses a genetic syndrome (Phelan-McDermid syndrome) that features autism spectrum disorder among its symptoms, maintaining the medical and behavioral context of autism as seen in the earlier text. Thus, the usage of ""autism spectrum disorder"" remains steady across different research contexts and time, reflecting an unchanged semantic drift."
51,Autism spectrum disorder,"Progress has recently been made in the earlier identification of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

52,Autism spectrum disorder,"Recently disclosed epidemiological data indicate a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism spectrum disorders. Previously, the incidence of autism has been reported as 4-5 per 10000 children. The most recent evidence indicates an increased incidence of about 1 per 500 children. However, the etiology of autism is yet to be determined. The recently disclosed data suggest a possible correlation between autism incidence and a previously unconsidered environmental toxin. It is generally accepted in the scientific community that radiofrequency (RF) radiation is a biologically active substance. It is also readily acknowledged that human exposures to RF radiation have become pervasive during the past 20 years, whereas such exposures were uncommon prior to that time. It is suggested that fetal or neo-natal exposures to RF radiation may be associated with an increased incidence of autism.","Ryan is a 5-year-old boy who was seen in a Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics clinic for disruptive behavior and developmental delay. His medical history was notable for a tethered spinal cord repaired at age 4 months, alternating exotropia with multiple surgeries, and obesity (body mass index at 99%). Ryan's development was globally delayed. He sat at age 10 months and walked at 24 months. An Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Toddler module (ADOS-T) was completed at age 19 months and demonstrated little-to-no concern for autism spectrum disorder.Ryan's parents described behavioral challenges including hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression toward him self and others, severe tantrums, a short attention span, and difficulty sleeping.

Neither text deviates from the established medical and psychological understanding of ASD, thus showing that the term has not undergone significant semantic drift between the two periods."
53,Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic influences. Clinical experience and limited empirical evidence support the view that autism may be associated with aberrant interhemispheric information transfer. This empirical controlled study examined whether, at neuropsychological testing, children with autism showed problems with interhemispheric information transfer. The study included auditory, visual, and motor measures covering information transfer within, as well as across, modalities. Thirty children (24 males, 6 females; mean age 12 years 8 months, SD 2 years 8 months; range 9 years 5 months to 17 years 5 months) without learning disability but with autism spectrum disorders were compared with 30 children from a mainstream school matched for age, sex, and IQ>75. Children with autism spectrum disorder performed significantly worse than the comparison group on most of the tests (p=0.02 for auditory perception and attention, p=0.005 for visual perception, p=0.0001 for motor control, p=0.04 for tactile perception). Results support the notion that aberrant interhemispheric transfer may be involved in the pathogenesis or clinical course of autism. The findings were not accounted for by lower IQ in the group with autism.","Whole-exome sequencing (WES) enables identification of pathogenic variants, including copy number variants (CNVs). In this study, we performed WES in 101 Japanese patients with unexplained developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) (63 males and 38 females), 98 of them with trio-WES. Pathogenic variants were identified in 54 cases (53.5%), including four cases with pathogenic CNVs. In one case, a pathogenic variant was identified by reanalysis of exome data; and in two cases, two molecular diagnoses were identified. Among 58 pathogenic variants, 49 variants occurred de novo in 48 patients, including two somatic variants. The accompanying autism spectrum disorder and external ear anomalies were associated with detection of pathogenic variants with odds ratios of 11.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-56.00) and 3.46 (95% CI 1.23-9.73), respectively. These findings revealed the importance of reanalysis of WES data and detection of CNVs and somatic variants in increasing the diagnostic yield for unexplained DD/ID. In addition, genetic testing is recommended when patients suffer from the autism spectrum disorder or external ear anomalies, which potentially suggests the involvement of genetic factors associated with gene expression regulation.","### Answer:

54,Autism spectrum disorder,"Difficulties in the cognitive processing of emotions--including difficulties identifying and describing feelings--are assumed to be an integral part of autism. We studied such difficulties via self-report in 27 high-functioning adults with autistic spectrum disorders, their biological relatives (n = 49), and normal adult controls (n = 35), using the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. The individuals with autism spectrum disorders were significantly more impaired in their emotion processing and were more depressed than those in the control and relative groups.","Neuronal nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) have been implicated in several diseases and disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and nicotine addiction. To understand the role of nAChRs in these conditions, it would be beneficial to have selective molecules that target specific nAChRs in vitro and in vivo. Our laboratory has previously identified a novel allosteric site on human α4β2 nAChRs using a series of computational and in vitro approaches. At this site, we have identified negative allosteric modulators that selectively inhibit human α4β2 nAChRs, a subtype implicated in nicotine addiction. This study characterizes the allosteric site via site-directed mutagenesis. Three amino acids (Phe118, Glu60, and Thr58) on the β2 subunit were shown to participate in the inhibitory properties of the selective antagonist KAB-18 and provided insights into its antagonism of human α4β2 nAChRs. SAR studies with KAB-18 analogues and various mutant α4β2 nAChRs also provided information concerning how different physiochemical features influence the inhibition of nAChRs through this allosteric site. Together, these studies identify the amino acids that contribute to the selective antagonism of human α4β2 nAChRs at this allosteric site. Finally, these studies define the physiochemical features of ligands that influence interaction with specific amino acids in this allosteric site.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
  Text A discusses autism spectrum disorder primarily in the context of cognitive and emotional processing challenges, emphasizing difficulties in identifying and processing emotions among individuals with the disorder. It centers on how those with autism spectrum disorders are affected in terms of their emotional and psychological state.

  Text B, while discussing autism spectrum disorder in a more biomedical context, focuses on research related to neuronal nicotinic receptors and their implications in various neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders. The focus here is more on the biochemistry and potential therapeutic targets, but it still regards autism as a neurological or neurodevelopmental condition.

  Despite these differing perspectives – one from a psychological view and the other from a molecular or biomedical angle – the underlying concept of autism spectrum disorder as a condition that affects neurological or cognitive function remains consistent between both texts. There is no significant shift in the fundamental understanding or description of the disorder itself, merely different approaches or facets of study. Therefore, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" has not undergone significant semantic drift between the contexts provided."
55,Autism spectrum disorder,"A recent study by Ingram et al. [2000b: Teratology 62:393-405] suggests a (His)73(Arg) polymorphism (A:G) in HOXA1 contributes substantially to a liability for autism. Using 68 individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders, they found a significant dearth of G homozygotes and biased transmission of G alleles from parents to affected offspring, especially from mothers. Because the connection between HOXA1 and liability to autism is compelling, we attempted to replicate their finding using a larger, independent sample from the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA) network. In our data, genotype frequencies conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; allele transmissions meet Mendelian expectations; and there is no obvious sex-biased allele transmission. Based on our sample size, calculations suggest that we would have at least 95% power to detect linkage and association even if the A:G polymorphism were to account for only 1% of the heritability of autism. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the samples in the two studies are intrinsically different, our data from our sample argue against a major role for HOXA1 (His)73(Arg) in liability to autism.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promote the development and maintenance of neural circuits. Alterations in these factors might contribute to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We asked whether serum BDNF, proBDNF, and IGF-1 levels are altered in an ASD population compared to controls. We measured serum BDNF, proBDNF, and IGF-1 immunoreactive protein in boys and girls aged 5-15 years old with mild to moderate ASD and non-autistic controls by ELISA. IGF-1 was increased in ASD serum compared to controls and was correlated with age and with CARS scores. Serum BDNF levels did not differ between groups, however, proBDNF serum levels were decreased in subjects with ASD compared to non-autistic controls. Medicated, but not unmedicated, ASD subjects exhibited lower serum proBDNF levels compared to controls, while neither IGF-1 nor BDNF levels differed between treatment groups. These data support the involvement of proBDNF and IGF-1 in the pathogenesis and treatment of autism.","### Label: Unchanged

56,Autism spectrum disorder,To examine the neural basis of impairments in interpreting facial emotions in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).,"Recently, it has been suggested that sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) not only are associated symptoms, but may be deeply related to ASD pathogenesis. Common clinical practice relating to developmental disorders, has shown that parents of children with ASD have often stated that it is more difficult to raise children in the neonatal period because these children exhibit sleep problems. This study investigated the possibility that abnormal neonatal sleep-wake rhythms are related to future ASD development. We administered questionnaires to assess parent(s) of children with ASD and controls. A retrospective analysis was conducted among 121 children with ASD (94 male and 27 female children) recruited from the K-Development Support Center for Children (K-ASD), 56 children with ASD (40 male and 16 female children) recruited from the H-Children's Sleep and Development Medical Research Center (H-ASD) and 203 children (104 male and 99 female children) recruited from four nursery schools in T-city (control). Irritable/over-reactive types of sleep-wake rhythms that cause difficulty in raising children, such as 1) frequently waking up, 2) difficulty falling asleep, 3) short sleep hours, and 4) continuous crying and grumpiness, were observed more often in ASD groups than in the control group. Additionally, the number of the mothers who went to bed after midnight during pregnancy was higher in the ASD groups than in the control group. Sleep-wake rhythm abnormalities in neonates may be considerable precursors to future development of ASD. Formation of ultradian and postnatal circadian rhythms should be given more attention when considering ASD development. Although this is a retrospective study, the results suggest that a prospective study regarding this issue may be important in understanding and discovering intervention areas that may contribute to preventing and/or properly treating ASD.","### Answer:

Both Text A and Text B utilize the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) within a clinical or developmental context related to specific impairments or difficulties associated with the condition. In Text A, the focus is on the impairments in interpreting facial emotions among children and adolescents with ASD, highlighting the manifestation of the disorder in social comprehension and emotional interaction. Text B extends the understanding of ASD to include associated sleep problems and explores the possibility that these sleep problems could be related to the pathogenesis of ASD itself, suggesting a deeper biological and developmental connection.

Despite the difference in the specific focus of the texts (emotional interpretation in Text A and sleep problems in Text B), the fundamental concept of ""autism spectrum disorder"" as a developmental disorder remains consistent. Both texts discuss research aimed at understanding different aspects of ASD and the impacts on individuals diagnosed with it. There's no indication of a drift in the core meaning or the clinical connotation of the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" between the two periods covered. Hence, the diagnosis and contextual usage of ASD remain largely unchanged, focusing on exploring and addressing various manifestations and complications related to the disorder."

58,Autism spectrum disorder,"The potential role of environmental factors in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is an area of emerging interest within the public and scientific communities. The high degree of heritability of ASD suggests that environmental influences are likely to operate through their interaction with genetic susceptibility during vulnerable periods of development. Evaluation of the plausibility of specific neurotoxicants as etiological agents in ASD should be guided by toxicological principles, including dose-effect dependency and pharmacokinetic parameters. Clinical and epidemiological investigations require the use of sufficiently powered study designs with appropriate control groups and unbiased case ascertainment and exposure assessment. Although much of the existing data that have been used to implicate environmental agents in ASD are limited by methodological shortcomings, a number of efforts are underway that will allow more rigorous evaluation of the role of environmental exposures in the etiology and/or phenotypic expression of the disorder. Surveillance systems are now in place that will provide reliable prevalence estimates going forward in time. Anticipated discoveries in genetics, brain pathology, and the molecular/cellular basis of functional impairment in ASD are likely to provide new opportunities to explore environmental aspects of this disorder.","Oxytocin (OXT) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that is released from the posterior pituitary gland and at specific targets in the central nervous system (CNS).

59,Autism spectrum disorder,"Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are an often-disabling continuum of disorders affecting two to four in 1000 children. These disorders have a core set of defining features including impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, impaired social interaction, and restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior. The cause of autism is unclear. The disorder can be defined only by related behaviors. Although there has been considerable improvement in standardized screening techniques for ASD in the past 10 years, screening and diagnostic practices in medicine and education lag far behind clinical research. Various studies have found the average age of diagnosis to be between 3 and 6 years, with significant differences as a function of ethnicity and socio-economic status. Preliminary research suggests that in some populations, missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of ASD are common. This may be caused partly by inadequate screening practices. It also may reflect that presentation of symptoms varies from patient to patient. Lack of resources for appropriate referral, diagnosis, and treatment may play an important role. This article discusses recent progress in ASD screening, what is known of current screening and diagnostic practices, and future directions for research and practice improvement. The best practice model for the screening and early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities should include routine developmental surveillance as part of well-child pediatric care. General developmental screening should be followed by autism-specific screening for those children who fail the initial developmental screen, or whose parents report suspect behaviors.","Utilizing surveillance data from five sites participating in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, we investigated contributions of surveillance subject and census tract population sociodemographic characteristics on variation in autism spectrum disorder ascertainment and prevalence estimates from 2000 to 2008 using ordinal hierarchical models for 2489 tracts. Multivariable analyses showed a significant increase in ascertainment of autism spectrum disorder cases through both school and health sources, the optimal ascertainment scenario, for cases with college-educated mothers (adjusted odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.09). Results from our examination of sociodemographic factors of tract populations from which cases were drawn also showed that after controlling for other covariates, statistical significance remained for associations between optimal ascertainment and percentage of Hispanic residents (adjusted odds ratio = 0.93, 95% confidence interval = 0.88-0.99) and percentage of residents with at least a bachelor's degree (adjusted odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.11). We identified sociodemographic factors associated with autism spectrum disorder prevalence estimates including race, ethnicity, education, and income. Determining which specific factors influence disparities is complicated; however, it appears that even in the presence of education, racial and ethnic disparities are still apparent. These results suggest disparities in access to autism spectrum disorder assessments and special education for autism spectrum disorder among ethnic groups may impact subsequent surveillance.","###Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder
- Text A: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is described focusing on the classic clinical presentation including impaired communication, social interaction issues, and repetitive behaviors. It also discusses the challenges in screening and diagnosis, emphasizing variations due to socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds.
- Text B: Focuses on the epidemiological aspects of ASD, examining how different sociodemographic factors influence the ascertainment and prevalence of ASD in various communities. The text discusses educational and ethnic disparities in accessing ASD assessments and services.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the core understanding and meaning of 'Autism spectrum disorder' remain constant, centering on its clinical and social implications, despite different emphases. Text A highlights clinical identification and diagnosis challenges, while Text B focuses on sociodemographic impacts on diagnosis rates. Both texts address the disorder within its defined behavioral and social interaction frameworks, showing continuity in the core definition of ASD across the two time periods. The discussions around the disorder in both texts revolve around understanding and addressing ASD rather than altering the fundamental perception of what ASD entails."
60,Autism spectrum disorder,"Cerebellar pathology has been associated with a number of developmental behavioral disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. Despite the fact that perinatal virus infections have been implicated in neurodevelopmental damage, few animal models have been developed to study the pathogenesis involved. One of the most interesting in vivo models of virus-induced cerebellar damage is the neonatal Borna disease virus (BDV) infection of the rat brain. The present review describes molecular, cellular, neuroanatomical, neurochemical and behavioral features of the BDV model and also provides a basis for a new understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of cerebellar malformation and associated behavioral deficits.","To investigate serum levels of VEGF, IGF-1 and FGF-2, and relationships with several clinical characteristics in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with and without bipolar disorder (BD).","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the phrase ""autism spectrum disorder"" is used to refer to the same broad range of developmental conditions affecting social interaction, communication, interests, and behavior. Text A discusses the potential impact of perinatal virus infections on neurodevelopmental damage associated with autism spectrum disorders, still within the framework of causative factors and neurodevelopment. Text B investigates biochemical markers and their potential relationships to the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents already diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In both cases, despite different focuses within research, the underlying definition and consideration of autism spectrum disorder as a developmental disorder remain consistent without a significant shift in meaning or connotation."
61,Autism spectrum disorder,"This study investigated the 50 ms (M50) and 100 ms (M100) components of the auditory evoked field to explore their change during development. Using MEG, neuromagnetic fields elicited by a 1 kHz sinusoidal tone were recorded in adults and two groups of children and adolescents with typical development or autism spectrum disorder. M50 amplitude was larger in children than in adults, suggesting a developmental trajectory with M50 amplitude decreasing and M100 increasing with age. Child M50 and M100 latencies were prolonged relative to adults. Children with autism did not differ from control children with respect to these observations. The M50 in relation to the M100 is a robust index of early auditory system maturation suitable for future developmental investigations.","According to DSM-5 criteria, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficiencies in social communication and interaction along with the presence of restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior. Few studies have explored the prevalence of behavioral addiction in individuals with ASD. Since addiction and ASD share common characteristics, individuals with ASD may be more vulnerable to addictive behaviors. Some typical behavioral addictions include internet, gaming, and gambling addiction. While most previous studies on ASD and addiction have looked at chemical addiction, behavioral addiction has not been thoroughly studied to date.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The term ""Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" is consistently used in both Text A and Text B to describe a neurodevelopmental condition with specific characteristics. In Text A, the usage of ASD is within a scientific research context, focusing on the neurological aspects as studied through the auditory evoked field in individuals with the disorder compared to typically developing children. In Text B, ASD is discussed in the context of DSM-5 criteria (a diagnostic standard in psychology and psychiatry), emphasizing the social communication defects and repetitive behaviors that define the disorder, while also exploring behavioral addictions in individuals with ASD.

In both texts, despite different focal points in research (neurological auditory responses vs. psychological and behavioral studies), the core understanding of ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder with specific behavioral and communicative attributes remains consistent. There is no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" between the texts from different periods. The term continues to refer to a complex condition marked by particular cognitive and behavioral symptoms as defined by clinical and psychiatric guidelines. This consistency across different research contexts and years indicates that there is no semantic drift in the term ""Autism spectrum disorder."""
62,Autism spectrum disorder,"Recent research has indicated that autism is not a discrete disorder and that family members of autistic probands have an increased likelihood of exhibiting autistic symptoms with a wide range of severity, often below the threshold for a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.","Despite the mounting evidence of efficacy of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders, there is little research that considers the various perceptions and resources with which parents respond to the pressures and opportunities associated with participation in early intervention. Research is particularly lacking surrounding experiences of parents with infants who are at risk of autism spectrum disorders but do not (yet) have a diagnosed condition.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both Text A and Text B use the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" to discuss varied degrees and presentations of symptoms associated with the disorder, with a focus on a broader spectrum that includes a range of symptom severities and the scope of interventions for those who fall under this spectrum. Text A discusses the variation in symptoms and the potential for family members of diagnosed individuals to show symptoms, reflecting a broader understanding of the disorder as encompassing a spectrum. Text B focuses on early intervention and perceptions related to children who are at risk of autism spectrum disorders, but still underscores the concept of a spectrum by considering varying symptoms and the early stages before a formal diagnosis. There is no significant shift in how ""autism spectrum disorder"" is conceptualized between the two texts, both align with the modern understanding of it being a spectrum with a range of manifestations."
63,Autism spectrum disorder,"To assess the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), routine G-banded cytogenetic analyses and FISH studies to rule out 15q11.2 and 17p11.2 duplications were performed on 49 children with ASDs. Blood samples were further studied using a complete set of subtelomeric FISH probes. Routine chromosome study showed that one child had a small duplication of chromosome 5: 46,XY,dup(5)(p?14.2p?15.1). Another child had an interstitial duplication of the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome critical region of chromosome 15, detected by FISH analysis. The detection of these two cases underscores the importance of obtaining routine chromosome and 15q11-q13 FISH analyses in children with ASDs. No instance of 17p11.2 duplication was observed. Subtelomeric analysis did not reveal abnormalities in any of the subjects.",  Compared with other conditions there has been a lack of focus on quality of life (QoL) as an outcome measure for children and young people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This pilot study aimed to evaluate the validity of existing QoL questionnaires for use with children with ASD aged 8-12 years.,"- Label: Changed

- Reason: The semantic drift of the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) between Text A and Text B is evident in the context and usage of the word. In Text A, the focus is predominantly on the genetic and cytogenetic aspects of ASD, detailing the meticulous examination of chromosomal abnormalities and specific genetic duplications associated with the disorder. This implies a primarily medical and diagnostic approach, where ASD is seen under the lens of biological and genetic factors. In contrast, Text B shifts the perspective to quality of life (QoL) and the social aspects of living with ASD. It discusses a pilot study evaluating QoL questionnaires for children with ASD, indicating a focus on the psychological, emotional, and social dimensions of the disorder, which are critical to the wellbeing and treatment outcomes for individuals with ASD. This shows a significant shift from viewing ASD merely as a set of symptoms and diagnoses to understanding it in terms of overall life experience and social impact, which suggests a broader, more integrative approach to the disorder."
64,Autism spectrum disorder,"Prior imaging studies have failed to show activation of the fusiform gyrus in response to emotionally neutral faces in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [Critchley et al., Brain 124 (2001) 2059; Schultz et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 57 (2000) 331]. However, individuals with ASD do not typically exhibit the striking behavioral deficits that might be expected to result from fusiform gyrus damage, such as those seen in prosopagnosia, and their deficits appear to extend well beyond face identification to include a wide range of impairments in social perceptual processing. In this study, our goal was to further assess the question of whether individuals with ASD have abnormal fusiform gyrus activation to faces. We used high-field (3 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to study face perception in 11 adult individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 10 normal controls. We used face stimuli, object stimuli, and sensory control stimuli (Fourier scrambled versions of the face and object stimuli) containing a fixation point in the center to ensure that participants were looking at and attending to the images as they were presented. We found that individuals with ASD activated the fusiform face area and other brain areas normally involved in face processing when they viewed faces as compared to non-face stimuli. These data indicate that the face-processing deficits encountered in ASD are not due to a simple dysfunction of the fusiform area, but to more complex anomalies in the distributed network of brain areas involved in social perception and cognition.","Pediatric populations continue to be understudied in clinical drug trials despite the increasing use of pharmacotherapy in children, particularly with psychotropic drugs. Most pertinent to the clinical selection of drug interventions are trials directly comparing drugs against other drugs. The aim was to measure the prevalence of active drug comparators in neuropsychiatric drug trials in children and identify the effects of funding source on comparator selection. We analyzed the selection of drugs and drug comparisons in clinical trials registered between January 2006 and May 2012. Completed and ongoing interventional trials examining treatments for six neuropsychiatric conditions in children were included. Networks of drug comparisons for each condition were constructed using information about the trial study arms. Of 421 eligible trial registrations, 228 (63,699 participants) were drug trials addressing ADHD (106 trials), autism spectrum disorders (47), unipolar depression (16), seizure disorders (38), migraines and other headaches (15), or schizophrenia (11). Active drug comparators were used in only 11.0% of drug trials while 44.7% used a placebo control and 44.3% no drug or placebo comparator. Even among conditions with well-established pharmacotherapeutic options, almost all drug interventions were compared to a placebo. Active comparisons were more common among trials without industry funding (17% vs. 8%, p=0.04). Trials with industry funding differed from non-industry trials in terms of the drugs studied and the comparators selected. For 73% (61/84) of drugs and 90% (19/21) of unique comparisons, trials were funded exclusively by either industry or non-industry. We found that industry and non-industry differed when choosing comparators and active drug comparators were rare for both groups. This gap in pediatric research activity limits the evidence available to clinicians treating children and suggests a need to reassess the design and funding of pediatric trials in order to optimize the information derived from pediatric participation in clinical trials. ","### Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder
- Text A: The first text discusses an imaging study focusing specifically on individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their brain activation patterns in response to faces, using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It contrasts previous findings about the fusiform gyrus' role in face processing with the observed broad network of brain areas involved in social perception and cognition in ASD. The text highlights that ASD impacts more than just the fusiform area but involves a complex network affecting social interactions.
  
- Text B: The second text addresses clinical drug trials targeting various neuropsychiatric conditions in pediatric populations, including autism spectrum disorders. It discusses the prevalence and nature of drug trials for ASD among other conditions, focusing on the type of comparators used (active drug vs. placebo), the influence of funding sources, and the implications of these factors for effective treatment strategies in children with ASD and other disorders.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both texts maintain a focus on autism spectrum disorder as a complex neurodevelopmental condition affecting social perception and broader brain functionality. Text A delves into specific neural mechanisms and areas implicated in ASD, while Text B discusses the broader implications of treatment strategies, including pharmacotherapy, in managing ASD. Despite the differences in focus—neural mechanisms versus treatment—both texts present ASD as a complex and multifaceted disorder without deviating significantly in the basic conceptual understanding of ASD across the observed time period. Therefore, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" has not undergone significant semantic drift between the two texts."
65,Autism spectrum disorder,"The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is poorly understood, although it is clear that genetic factors play a major role. ASDs appear to be a heterogeneous group of disorders, making genetic analysis difficult in the absence of etiologically definable subgroups. The excess of males in the affected population has led to suggestions that an X-linked locus could play a role in the causation of autism or a related pervasive developmental disorder. To examine this, we have investigated the genotypes of 31 families with two or more affected boys, at a series of 16 highly polymorphic loci distributed along the X chromosome with an average interlocus distance of 12 cM, in order to identify regions of significantly increased concordance among pairs of affected brothers. No locus tested showed a significant increase in concordance, supporting findings by others that there are no genes of major effect located on the X chromosome that contribute to increased susceptibility to ASD.","Children with the single-gene disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) appear to be at an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and exhibit a unique social-cognitive phenotype compared with children with idiopathic ASD. A complete framework is required to better understand autism in NF1, from neurobiological levels through to behavioural and functional outcomes. The primary aims of this study are to establish the frequency of ASD in children with NF1, examine the social cognitive phenotype, investigate the neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social functioning in children with NF1, and to investigate novel structural and functional neurobiological markers of ASD and social dysfunction in NF1. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the neuropsychological and neurobiological features of ASD in children with NF1 to a matched group of patients with idiopathic ASD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) is used within a medical and developmental context, specifically focusing on genetic and neurobiological factors. Text A focuses on exploring genetic factors contributing to ASD and investigates the possibility of X-linked genetic influence, presenting autism as a condition influenced by complex genetic components. Similarly, Text B continues addressing ASD in a medical framework, now focusing on a specific genetic disorder (neurofibromatosis type 1) and its relation to ASD, highlighting the risk and neurobiological underpinnings. In both cases, ASD retains its medical and developmental disorder connotation, emphasizing genetics and neuropsychology. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" remains consistent across both texts, reinforcing its characterization as a complex developmental disorder with genetic and neurological basis."
66,Autism spectrum disorder,"At least five per cent of the general population of children suffer from severe neuropsychiatric impairment. Autism spectrum disorders, ADHD/DAMP, Tourette's syndrome, and a variety of cognitive impairment/neurological syndromes with severe behavioral/emotional symptoms are included among the child neuropsychiatric disorders, the majority of which will lead to ongoing social and academic problems in adult life. Substantial numbers of those affected commit crimes in early adult life, and the incidence of the above-mentioned disorders is higher among young criminal offenders. Early diagnosis, educational, psychological, and, occasionally, medical therapies can affect outcome in a positive way. Child neuropsychiatric disorders should therefore be recognized at an early age so that attitudes can be changed from rejection to understanding, and a gloomy psychosocial outcome avoided.","Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social and communication skills and repetitive and stereotyped interests and behaviours. Although not part of the diagnostic criteria, individuals with autism experience a host of motor impairments, potentially due to abnormalities in how they learn motor control throughout development. Here, we used behavioural techniques to quantify motor learning in autism spectrum disorder, and structural brain imaging to investigate the neural basis of that learning in the cerebellum. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder and 20 typically developing control subjects, aged 8-12, made reaching movements while holding the handle of a robotic manipulandum. In random trials the reach was perturbed, resulting in errors that were sensed through vision and proprioception. The brain learned from these errors and altered the motor commands on the subsequent reach. We measured learning from error as a function of the sensory modality of that error, and found that children with autism spectrum disorder outperformed typically developing children when learning from errors that were sensed through proprioception, but underperformed typically developing children when learning from errors that were sensed through vision. Previous work had shown that this learning depends on the integrity of a region in the anterior cerebellum. Here we found that the anterior cerebellum, extending into lobule VI, and parts of lobule VIII were smaller than normal in children with autism spectrum disorder, with a volume that was predicted by the pattern of learning from visual and proprioceptive errors. We suggest that the abnormal patterns of motor learning in children with autism spectrum disorder, showing an increased sensitivity to proprioceptive error and a decreased sensitivity to visual error, may be associated with abnormalities in the cerebellum.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Autism spectrum disorder"" is still primarily used to refer to a developmental disorder characterized by particular behavioral and cognitive traits, including difficulties with social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Text A highlights socio-behavioral implications and the broad scope of neuropsychiatric disorders that include Autism spectrum disorder, focusing also on the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Text B provides a more detailed exploration into specific aspects such as motor impairments and peculiarities in motor learning in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder, reflecting scientific advances in understanding the mechanism and manifestations of the disorder. Despite these differences in focus and depth, the essential meaning and nature of what ""Autism spectrum disorder"" represents remains constant. The core understanding of the disorder as a spectrum of developmental and neurological conditions influencing behavior and learning abilities has not undergone significant semantic drift."
67,Autism spectrum disorder,"Psychiatric patients are significantly more often smokers than the general population, the only known exception being obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and catatonic schizophrenia. We have investigated nicotine use in subjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Ninety-five subjects (25 females and 70 males) consecutively diagnosed with any ASD and of normal intelligence were included in the study. Only 12.6% were smokers, compared with 19% in the general population and 47% in a control group of 161 outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or a schizophreniform disorder. The results suggest that smoking is rare among subjects with ASD, while the opposite was shown for schizophrenia. If replicated, this finding could suggest biological differences between non-catatonic schizophrenia and ASD, and support the theory of a biological link between ASD and a subtype of OCD, and between ASD and catatonic schizophrenia.","The gut hormone ghrelin has been implicated in a variety of functional roles in the central nervous system through the brain-gut axis, one of which is an anti-inflammatory effect. An aberrant brain-gut axis producing immune dysfunction has been implicated in the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and elevated expression of inflammatory markers has been shown in blood and brain tissue from subjects with ASD. We hypothesized that ghrelin may mitigate this effect. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from typically developed children (TD-C) (","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the expression ""autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" refers to a developmental disorder characterized by challenges with social interaction, communication, and by a presence of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Text A focuses on the prevalence of smoking among individuals with ASD and provides comparative data with other mental health disorders to discuss its rarity among the ASD population. Text B discusses an aspect of ASD that involves biochemical processes and the brain-gut axis, which is also rooted in understanding the biological and physiological aspects of ASD. Despite studying different characteristics and impacts of ASD in different contexts - smoking habits in Text A and inflammatory processes in Text B - the core reference to ASD remains consistent with its understanding as a developmental and neurobiological condition. Therefore, there is no semantic drift in the use of ""autism spectrum disorder"" between the two texts."
68,Autism spectrum disorder,"While professionals commonly advocate sharing information about autism spectrum disorders with siblings, no guidelines currently exist that describe what types of information might be relevant for siblings at different ages. To address this issue, the interviewing method described by Bibace and Walsh (1979, 1980), which measures cognitive sophistication in thinking about illness, was adapted to examine perspectives on autism spectrum disorders. Sixty-three siblings of individuals with autism or related disorders were interviewed using this measure. Parents were given the same interview as their child, and asked to predict their child's responses. Children's reasoning became more mature with age, but developed at a delayed rate compared to norms for illness concepts. Although accurate in estimating their child's understanding of the definition and cause of their sibling's diagnosis, parents tended to overestimate their child's understanding of the disorder's impact.","In preterm newborns, the ductus arteriosus frequently fails to close and the infants require medical or surgical closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A PDA can be treated surgically; or medically with one of two prostaglandin inhibitors, indomethacin or ibuprofen. Case reports suggest that paracetamol may be an alternative for the closure of a PDA. An association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to paracetamol and later development of autism or autism spectrum disorder has been reported.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" is discussed primarily in the context of family and social dynamics, focusing on how understanding of the disorder develops within the context of siblings and parents understanding the cognitive and social impact on family members. It addresses nuanced intrafamilial communication and awareness about the disorder. On the other hand, Text B discusses ""autism spectrum disorder"" in a clinical and potentially causal context, exploring associations between environmental or prenatal factors (specifically, medication exposure) and the later development of the disorder. This shift from a psychological and developmental understanding towards exploring potential biomedical causations and associations indicates a significant semantic drift in the contexts and implications surrounding the term over time."
69,Autism spectrum disorder,"Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition that is strongly associated with the development of an autism spectrum disorder. However, there is marked variability in expression, and only a subset of children with tuberous sclerosis develop autism spectrum disorder. Clarification of the mechanisms that underlie the association and variability in expression will potentially throw light on the biological processes involved in the etiology of idiopathic forms of autism spectrum disorder. Current evidence indicates that the likelihood of a child with tuberous sclerosis developing an autism spectrum disorder is greater if the child has a mutation in the TSC2 gene, although autism can and does develop in children with TSC1 mutations. The likelihood is also greater if the child has early-onset infantile spasms that are difficult to control, especially if there is an epileptiform focus in the temporal lobes. The emerging evidence is consistent with the notion that early onset electrophysiological disturbances within the temporal lobes (and perhaps other locations) has a deleterious effect on the development and establishment of key social cognitive representations concerned with processing social information, perhaps especially from faces. However, alternative mechanisms to account for the findings cannot yet be ruled out. Future research will have to employ prospective longitudinal designs and treatment trials to clarify the processes involved.","MOMO is an acronym for macrosomia, obesity, macrocephaly and ocular abnormalities. The syndrome was first described in 1993, with a total of nine patients published thus far. All the cases presented intellectual disability and in one case autism was described. We present a new case of a patient with MOMO syndrome, who consulted for hallucinatory phenomena. He completed a neuropsychological, clinical and cognitive evaluation, showing a borderline intelligence quotient and fulfilled the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. This is the first neurocognitive evaluation of a patient with MOMO, supporting the use of standardized scales in order to assess the autism and other psychiatric comorbidities in patients with genetics syndromes.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, ""autism spectrum disorder"" is described in a clinical and medical context, emphasizing the condition as associated with genetic syndromes (Tuberous sclerosis in Text A and MOMO syndrome in Text B). The term refers to a range of conditions affecting social interaction, communication, interests, and behavior, a point which holds consistent in both texts. Although the specific genetic conditions associated vary, the fundamental understanding and identification of autism spectrum disorder do not drift between the texts, retaining a similar connotation and meaning focused around identifiable patterns and traits related to neurological and cognitive development. Thus, the usage of the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" remains unchanged."
70,Autism spectrum disorder,"Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neuro-genetic disorder. It has been reported that cases due to paternal deletion 15q11-13 (Del) behave differently to cases due to uniparental disomy (UPD). Comparison of the two forms of PWS has, to date, not included the frequency of autistic behaviours, even though there are reports of an association between maternal duplications of 15q11-13 and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It was predicted that maternal UPD PWS cases would be more prone to ASD than Del PWS cases due to their duplicated maternally expressed genes. A preliminary test of the hypothesis was conducted using postal and telephone surveys of matched, genetically verified, UPD and Del cases using the Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS). As predicted, UPD cases were reported as exhibiting significantly more autistic symptomatology. They also were born to older mothers and were reported on the VABS to have more deficits in motor control problems and fewer adaptive skills in the Daily Living Skills domain. Del cases were reportedly more skilled at jigsaw puzzles. The results lend further support to the notion that abnormality in the expression of maternal imprinted 15q11-13 genes may confer a susceptibility to ASD. They also suggest that there may be cognitive differences between the groups in processing visuo-spatial information.","Empathic accuracy refers to the ability of perceivers to accurately share the emotions of protagonists. Using a novel task assessing embarrassment, the current study sought to compare levels of empathic embarrassment accuracy among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with those of matched controls. To assess empathic embarrassment accuracy, we compared the level of embarrassment experienced by protagonists to the embarrassment felt by participants while watching the protagonists. The results show that while the embarrassment ratings of participants and protagonists were highly matched among controls, individuals with ASD failed to exhibit this matching effect. Furthermore, individuals with ASD rated their embarrassment higher than controls when viewing themselves and protagonists on film, but not while performing the task itself. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD tend to have higher ratings of empathic embarrassment, perhaps due to difficulties in emotion regulation that may account for their impaired empathic accuracy and aberrant social behavior.","###Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder
- Text A: Discusses the association of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with genetic factors in the context of Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS). It particularly focuses on how genetic variations like paternal deletion and maternal uniparental disomy influence the manifestation of ASD-related behaviors. The approach is more clinical and genetic, highlighting the susceptibility based on genetic abnormalities.
- Text B: Presents ASD in the context of social empathy and emotional regulation, pinpointing specific challenges faced by individuals with ASD, such as impaired empathic accuracy and higher self-assessed levels of embarrassment when compared to controls. This context frames ASD in terms of social interaction and emotional processing abilities.
- Label: Changed
- Reason: While both texts discuss ASD, the context and perception of the disorder have shifted. Text A focuses on the genetic and clinical aspects, analyzing ASD as part of a broader syndrome. Text B, however, examines the behavioral and emotional regulation aspects, showcasing the social and psychological impacts of ASD on an individual's ability to function in social contexts. This shift from a clinical-genetic focus to an emphasis on social-behavioral understanding underlines a significant semantic drift in the discourse surrounding autism spectrum disorders."
71,Autism spectrum disorder,"The treatment of seizure disorders EEG epileptiform abnormalities without epilepsy in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is considered within the context of the relationship of epilepsy and epileptiform disorders to language, behavior, and cognition. There is an increased prevalence of both epilepsy and abnormal potentially epileptogenic activity in children with ASD. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of anticonvulsants to treat epileptiform discharges thought to be producing dysfunction in selected aspects of cognition, language, or behavior makes a positive difference in a subgroup of children with ASD, but there is inadequate evidence on which to base specific recommendations. There is, at present, no scientific justification for considering epilepsy surgery in children with ASD in the absence of intractable clinical seizures.","Since the turn of the new millennium, care for people with intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorders (IDD) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has drawn increasing attention because of the continuous prevalence increase of these two conditions, the high health vulnerability, especially mental vulnerability, and the crucial role of care provision in the setting of continued deinstitutionalization and the shift to community care. The present review addresses the main issues related to mental healthcare in youth with IDD and/or ASD with a specific focus on adolescence and transition to adulthood.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) maintains a similar usage and meaning, focusing on the clinical and developmental aspects of the condition. Text A discusses the relationship between ASD, epilepsy, and cognitive disorders, emphasizing medical and therapeutic interventions. Meanwhile, Text B expands on the broader context of care and health vulnerabilities among people with ASD, especially in transitional life phases like adolescence to adulthood. Both texts reflect a consistent recognition of ASD as a neurological and developmental disorder impacting various facets of life and development, thereby using the term without significant deviation in connotation or thematic application between the two time periods."
72,Autism spectrum disorder,"We determined innate and adaptive immune responses in children with developmental regression and autism spectrum disorders (ASD, N=71), developmentally normal siblings (N=23), and controls (N=17). With lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a stimulant for innate immunity, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 59/71 (83.1%) ASD patients produced >2 SD above the control mean (CM) values of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and/or IL-6 produced by control PBMCs. ASD PBMCs produced higher levels of proinflammatory/counter-regulatory cytokines without stimuli than controls. With stimulants of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), tetanus, IL-12p70, and IL-18, PBMCs from 47.9% to 60% of ASD patients produced >2 SD above the CM values of TNF-alpha depending on stimulants. Our results indicate excessive innate immune responses in a number of ASD children that may be most evident in TNF-alpha production.","The current study explored how and to what extent sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacted their parents' quality of life (QOL). A total of 440 ASD children and 344 age-matched typically developing (TD) children were included in the case-control designed study. In the TD group, a linear regression model showed that the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) total scores were negatively associated with maternal mental health summary (MCS) scores in the SF-36v2 (β = - 2.831), while in the ASD group, the CSHQ total scores were negatively associated with the parental physical health summary (PCS) scores (β = - 3.030 for mothers, β = - 3.651 for fathers). Path analysis showed that sleep problems in ASD children had both direct and indirect effects on maternal PCS scores. The results indicated that sleep problems in children with ASD might affect parental QOL differently from TD children, and act as independent impact factors on parental physical health.","- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:**
  In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) refers to the same diagnostic category within mental health, emphasizing a variety of developmental issues that primarily affect social interaction and communication skills.

  - **Text A** discusses ASD in relation to immune responses, highlighting physiological observations and their potential implications in children diagnosed with ASD. The focus here is on the excessive immune responses found in ASD patients when subjected to different stimuli, identifying heightened levels of certain cytokines.

  - **Text B** explores the impact of sleep problems in children with ASD on their parents' quality of life. Although it shifts the focus to a more specific everyday challenge associated with ASD (sleep problems) and its broader impacts on family dynamics, the fundamental understanding of ASD remains the consistent basis from which various effects (immunological, psychological, social) are investigated.

  Both texts use the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" within the typical clinical and developmental context without altering the foundational meaning of the diagnosis.

73,Autism spectrum disorder,Whether there is an unusual degree of unevenness in the cognitive abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and whether different cognitive profiles among children with ASD might index etiologically significant subgroups are questions of continued debate in autism research.,"Video-based instruction has been effective in teaching a range of skills, including functional living skills, to individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Few studies have compared the efficacy and efficiency across video modality-specifically, comparing video modeling to video prompting. Consequently, practitioners have little empirical guidance when selecting between procedural variations of video-based instruction. Using an adaptive alternating-treatments design with a baseline, we evaluated the comparative effectiveness of point-of-view video modeling and video prompting on the percentage of meal preparation tasks completed correctly and on-task behavior with 4 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. We found video modeling to be effective and efficient in the acquisition of meal preparation skills across 3 of the 4 participants. Across participants, video prompting resulted in more errors than video modeling did. Skills generalized to an untrained location and were maintained at a 3-week follow-up. Stakeholders reported procedures, goals, and outcomes as socially valid.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In Text A, the target word ""autism spectrum disorder"" refers to a developmental disorder marked by varying degrees and characteristics of social interaction, communication, and cognitive abilities, whereas in Text B, the term is used with a similar understanding as it continues to describe individuals with the disorder and explores effective teaching methods for them. In both cases, the word conveys the understanding of a complex developmental disorder with various impacts on individuals, with no significant shift in meaning or context. The focus on different aspects of managing or understanding the disorder does not alter the core meaning of the term between the two texts."
74,Autism spectrum disorder,"Tuberous sclerosis complex is a multisystem disorder in which neurologic problems cause the greatest disability. High rates of mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders are associated with the diagnosis. Early-onset seizures and increased tuber burden are risk factors for cognitive impairment. Early-onset seizures, particularly infantile spasms, are risk factors for autism. Tubers within the temporal lobe and cerebellum are often mentioned as risk factors for autism, although the findings are inconsistent. Seizure control is important for developmental outcome and quality of life. Early behavioral assessment and therapeutic intervention, as well as seizure control, are the most effective means of promoting neurodevelopmental outcome.","Previous research suggests that many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have impaired facial identity recognition, and also exhibit abnormal visual scanning of faces. Here, two hypotheses accounting for an association between these observations were tested: i) better facial identity recognition is associated with increased gaze time on the Eye region; ii) better facial identity recognition is associated with increased eye-movements around the face.","### Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder
- Text A: This text discusses autism spectrum disorders in the context of tuberous sclerosis complex, touching upon neurological challenges that result from the condition. Autism is described predominantly in relation to its association with other neurological symptoms, emphasizing the impairment aspect and risk factors like early-onset seizures and tuber locations influencing the risk of autism.
- Text B: This text examines cognitive and perceptual aspects of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), specifically how individuals with ASD process facial identity. It highlights cognitive research into visual scanning behaviors and gaze patterns, significantly focusing on the understanding and analysis of social cognition deficits in ASD.
- Label: Changed
- Reason: The target word ""autism spectrum disorder"" demonstrates a significant shift in focus and context between the two texts. In Text A, ASD is portrayed in relation to physical neurological risks and outcomes associated with a genetic disorder. In Text B, the perspective is more cognitive and psychological, examining how ASD affects social perception and face recognition, which implies a broader and more nuanced understanding of the condition, moving beyond just neurological associations to include cognitive and social functioning aspects."
75,Autism spectrum disorder,"This study examined the inhibitory control mechanisms of selective attention in autism spectrum disorders. Two issues were engaged: First, we extend previous findings of normal inhibition of distractor identity in autism by examining whether inhibition of spatial location is also spared. The second issue concerns the selectivity of inhibition. In non-clinical participants inhibition is selectively directed to the properties of the distractor that compete for the control of action; we examined whether individuals with autism also show normal selectivity of inhibition.","Many (> 40%) women discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy because of concerns about effects on the foetus, based on information from inadequately-controlled studies.

The purpose of this review was to investigate the evidence from sibling-control analyses for adverse outcomes in offspring associated with antidepressant exposure during pregnancy. Fourteen sibling-control studies were identified through searches of PubMed and Embase. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, neonatal size, birth defects, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioural problems, neurodevelopmental deficits, and scholastic attainment. For the majority of these outcomes, no statistically significant associations were found when comparing exposed and unexposed siblings. Single studies reported associations with preterm birth, reduced gestational age, ADHD, anxiety at 36 months, and lower mathematics test scores, which persisted in the sibling-control analyses. However, differences were small and possibly not clinically significant. Moreover, effects of residual confounding could not be excluded. These findings provide evidence that many of the previously reported associations between prenatal antidepressant exposure and adverse outcomes in offspring are no longer statistically significant when exposed offspring are compared with unexposed siblings. The few statistically significant differences in sibling-control analyses were generally small with doubtful clinical significance. Decisions on antidepressant treatment during pregnancy should be made individually, based on evidence from properly controlled studies, not on misleading information based on studies that have not controlled adequately for confounding factors.","### Answer:

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, ""Autism spectrum disorder"" is used to refer to a specific neurodevelopmental condition characterized by certain patterns in behavior, social interaction, and communication skills. Text A explores cognitive functions related to autism, while Text B discusses it as one of the potential outcomes in offspring after prenatal exposure to antidepressants. The core meaning, referring to the disorder itself, remains constant across both contexts."
76,Autism spectrum disorder,"The broad variation in phenotypes and severities within autism spectrum disorders suggests the involvement of multiple predisposing factors, interacting in complex ways with normal developmental courses and gradients. Identification of these factors, and the common developmental path into which they feed, is hampered by the large degrees of convergence from causal factors to altered brain development, and divergence from abnormal brain development into altered cognition and behaviour. Genetic, neurochemical, neuroimaging, and behavioural findings on autism, as well as studies of normal development and of genetic syndromes that share symptoms with autism, offer hypotheses as to the nature of causal factors and their possible effects on the structure and dynamics of neural systems. Such alterations in neural properties may in turn perturb activity-dependent development, giving rise to a complex behavioural syndrome many steps removed from the root causes. Animal models based on genetic, neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioural manipulations offer the possibility of exploring these developmental processes in detail, as do human studies addressing endophenotypes beyond the diagnosis itself.","The role of imitation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is controversial. Researchers have argued that deficient control of self- and other-related motor representations (self-other distinction) might explain imitation difficulties. In a recent EEG study, we showed that control of imitation relies on high-level as well as on low-level cognitive processes. Here, we aimed to further our insights into control of imitation deficits in ASD. We focused on congruency effects in the P3 (high-level), the N190 and the readiness potential (RP; low-level). We predicted smaller congruency effects within the P3 in the ASD group. However, we found differences in the RP and not in the P3-component. Thus, high-level self-other distinction centred on motor actions may be preserved in ASD, while impairments are reflected during motor preparation.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
  Text A discusses autism spectrum disorder mainly from a broad biomedical and developmental perspective. It mentions genetic, neurochemical, neuroimaging, and behavioral findings, and describes the complexity and variability of the disorder's manifestations. This illustrates a view of autism as a complex aggregation of symptoms influenced by various biological and neurological factors.

  Text B, however, takes a more focused psychological and cognitive approach, specifically examining the deficits in imitation and motor control in individuals with autism. The detailed analysis of specific EEG study results, particularly regarding motor representation and preparation, represents a shift toward understanding functional and situational manifestations of ASD in cognitive neuroscience.

  Thus, there’s a significant shift in the focus from a general and clinical description of ASD as a neurological and developmental disorder to a detailed analysis of specific cognitive functions and deficits, suggesting a change in the discourse surrounding autism spectrum disorder over time, and how its study and understanding have evolved into more detailed cognitive mechanisms."
77,Autism spectrum disorder,"The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) can be confirmed by genetic laboratory in about 80% of cases. In 20%, the diagnosis remains clinical, but often there is uncertainty about the correctness of the clinical diagnosis and alternative diagnoses may be investigated. In evaluating individuals for AS in our center since 1989, we have encountered several mimicking conditions, and additional ones have been reported in the literature. Mimicking conditions can be grouped into the areas of chromosome, single gene, and symptom complex anomalies. Microdeletions or microduplications include chromosome regions 2,4,17, 22, and 15. Single gene conditions include methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (MTHFR), Rett syndrome, alpha-thalassemia retardation syndrome (ATR-X), and Gurrieri syndrome. Symptom complexes include cerebral palsy, static encephalopathy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, pervasive developmental delay (PDD), and mitochondrial disorders. We present a review of these mimicking disorders to increase the awareness about conditions that can lead to an incorrect clinical diagnosis of AS.","Bullying victimization is commonly associated with anxiety among individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and both bullying victimization and anxiety are more prevalent among youth with ASD than in the general population. We explored individual and contextual factors that relate to anxiety in adolescents and young adults with ASD who also experience bullying victimization. Participants included 101 mothers of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ASD. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization and anxiety in children with ASD, as well as parenting stress as a potential moderator of that relationship. Findings indicate that parenting stress moderates the association between bullying victimization and anxiety. The severity of anxiety was most strongly associated with bullying victimization when mothers reported high levels of stress. Implications for interventions that assist parents with coping and address bullying victimization are discussed.","### Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder
- Text A: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mentioned as one of several potential misdiagnoses or conditions that can mimic Angelman syndrome. Here, ASD is conceptualized as a disorder in a list of differential diagnoses, which may complicate the clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome. The context is mainly medical and focuses on the diagnostic challenge posed by similar symptoms shared with other disorders.
- Text B: ASD is discussed primarily in relation to the social experiences and psychological impacts (specifically anxiety) associated with bullying in individuals diagnosed with the condition. The emphasis is on understanding the interaction between the environment, individual psychological outcomes (such as anxiety), and the role of parental stress in influencing these outcomes. This approach to discussing ASD includes a broader understanding of the social dimensions and challenges faced by individuals with the disorder.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The usage of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" has shifted from strictly a medical or clinical diagnostic entity in Text A to encompassing a broader, psychosocial aspect in Text B, which addresses the societal, emotional, and familial impacts alongside clinical aspects. The semantic field in Text A is narrower, focusing on clinical diagnosis and differential diagnostic challenges, while Text B's usage of ASD integrates social dynamics, mental health, and environmental interactions, reflecting a more holistic understanding of the disorder and its impacts on life experiences. This change demonstrates a significant shift in the contextual and connotative usage of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" from purely medical to include important psychosocial dimensions."
78,Autism spectrum disorder,"There is active debate regarding the nature of executive dysfunction in autism. Additionally, investigations have yet to show a relationship between deficits in executive function and the everyday behavioral difficulties that may originate from them. The present study examined the relationship between executive abilities and adaptive behavior in 35 children with Autism Spectrum Disorders, using two parent reports of everyday functioning, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Results found several relationships: The Initiate and Working Memory domains were negatively correlated with most domains of adaptive behavior. Also, the Communication and Socialization domains of the VABS were negatively correlated with several areas of executive functioning, suggesting that impairments in executive abilities are strongly associated with the deficits in communication, play and social relationships found in children with autism.","It is estimated that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children. Early identification of an ASD is exceedingly important to the introduction of an intervention. We are developing a robot-assisted approach that will serve as an improved diagnostic and early intervention tool for children with autism. The robot, named PABI® (Penguin for Autism Behavioral Interventions), is a compact humanoid robot taking on an expressive cartoon-like embodiment. The robot is affordable, durable, and portable so that it can be used in various settings including schools, clinics, and the home. Thus enabling significantly enhanced and more readily available diagnosis and continuation of care. Through facial expressions, body motion, verbal cues, stereo vision-based tracking, and a tablet computer, the robot is capable of interacting meaningfully with an autistic child. Initial implementations of the robot, as part of a comprehensive treatment model (CTM), include Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy where the child interacts with a tablet computer wirelessly interfaced with the robot. At the same time, the robot makes meaningful expressions and utterances and uses stereo cameras in eyes to track the child, maintain eye contact, and collect data such as affect and gaze direction for charting of progress. In this paper we present the clinical justification, anticipated usage with corresponding requirements, prototype development of the robotic system, and demonstration of a sample application for robot-assisted ABA therapy. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" is used with a similar meaning though applied in different contexts. Text A discusses research relationships between executive abilities and adaptive behavior in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, focusing on the psychological and behavioral aspects, which paints a picture of challenges in communication and socialization. Text B introduces innovative technology for diagnosis and intervention in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, focusing on early diagnosis and robotic-assisted therapy. Though the contexts are different, the underlying definition and understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorder as a variable developmental issue affecting communication, behavior, and social skills are consistent between the two texts. Both instances regard Autism Spectrum Disorder as a condition that impacts cognitive and social development and requires systematic approaches either via psychological assessment or technological intervention. Thus, the semantic meaning of the term remains essentially unchanged between the periods."
79,Autism spectrum disorder,"Evidence suggests that autism is associated with impaired emotion perception, but it is unknown how early such impairments are evident. Furthermore, most studies that have assessed emotion perception in children with autism have required verbal responses, making results difficult to interpret. This study utilized high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether 3-4-year-old children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show differential brain activity to fear versus neutral facial expressions. It has been shown that normal infants as young as 7 months of age show differential brain responses to faces expressing different emotions. ERPs were recorded while children passively viewed photos of an unfamiliar woman posing a neutral and a prototypic fear expression. The sample consisted of 29 3-4-year-old children with ASD and 22 chronological age-matched children with typical development. Typically developing children exhibited a larger early negative component (N300) to the fear than to the neutral face. In contrast, children with ASD did not show the difference in amplitude of this early ERP component to the fear versus neutral face. For a later component, typically developing children exhibited a larger negative slow wave (NSW) to the fear than to the neutral face, whereas children with autism did not show a differential NSW to the two stimuli. In children with ASD, faster speed of early processing (i. e. N300 latency) of the fear face was associated with better performance on tasks assessing social attention (social orienting, joint attention and attention to distress). These data suggest that children with ASD, as young as 3 years of age, show a disordered pattern of neural responses to emotional stimuli.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by defects in two core domains, social/communication skills and restricted/repetitive behaviors or interests. There is no approved biomarker for ASD diagnosis, and the current diagnostic method is based on clinical manifestation, which tends to vary vastly between the affected individuals due to the heterogeneous nature of ASD. There is emerging evidence that supports the implication of the immune system in ASD, specifically autoimmunity; however, the role of autoantibodies in ASD children is not yet fully understood.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts A and B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) is used consistently to refer to a neurodevelopmental condition that affects individuals, particularly in aspects of social interaction, communication, and behavior. Text A focuses on a specific study related to emotion perception in children with ASD, detailing specific neural response patterns. Text B discusses the broader characteristics and considerations of ASD, including diagnostic challenges and emerging scientific insights such as its possible connection with the immune system. Both texts present ASD as a complex, multifaceted disorder that manifests variably across individuals, supporting the consistent use and meaning of the term across the different contexts and time frames. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift observed between the texts; the fundamental understanding and portrayal of ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder remain unchanged."
80,Autism spectrum disorder,"The purpose of this work was to relate clinical neuropsychiatric findings to histopathological diagnoses and seizure outcome in a retrospective study of 16 children undergoing temporal lobe resections due to medically intractable epilepsy. These children constitute a heterogeneous group in which neuropsychiatric symptoms were common. The results of this study indicate a correlation between malformations of cortical development, less chance of seizure freedom, and neuropsychiatric problems in children with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. It is important to include neuropsychiatric assessments pre- and postoperatively and to inform parents that symptoms of autism spectrum disorders may or may not be improved after epilepsy surgery.","In clinical practice, pharmacological treatment is mostly focused on behavioral symptoms in everyday life. Nevertheless, persistent effort continues to develop medication for causal treatment. Recent changes in diagnostic criteria from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) to DSM-5 would affect not only diagnosing approaches, but also therapeutic approaches. Because previous pervasive developmental disorders have been integrated into a single entity, the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we have to prepare for what medications are valuable for the ASD. In this article, we reviewed the following etiological treatment: acetylcholine and glutamate related medicine; amino acid medicine such as secretin, endogenous opioid, and oxytocin; complementary and alternative medicine such as chelating agents, vitamins, and omega-3; promising drugs related to the scope of pharmacogenetics currently under study. ","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
Upon examination of the texts provided, the essential concept of ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (ASD) has not undergone a significant shift in its central essence or meaning. In both Text A from an earlier period and Text B from a later period, the description and discussions regarding ASD focus consistently on clinical and therapeutic contexts.

In Text A, ASD is discussed in relation to its neuropsychiatric symptoms, implications in a medical-surgical context (epilepsy surgery), and assessments in a clinical setting. There is a focus on how the disorder impacts children undergoing temporal-lobe resections, which underscores a pathological and clinical analysis typical of discussions around ASD.

In Text B, despite alluding to more recent changes in diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5) and expanding on a variety of treatment approaches, including pharmacological treatments for behavioral symptoms and possibilities for etiological treatments, the fundamental understanding of ASD as a disorder on a spectrum with diverse therapeutic needs remains consistent. It cites updates in terms of diagnostic criteria and treatment, yet the target word ""autism spectrum disorder"" retains its semantic essence of a neurological-developmental condition that affects behavior.

In considering both texts, although advancements in diagnosis and treatment are apparent between the years of the studies, the core meaning of 'Autism Spectrum Disorder' as a diagnosable and treatable neuropsychiatric condition has not deviated. The shifts described in diagnoses and treatments enhance understanding and methodologies but do not alter the foundational meaning of ASD. Hence, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged"".

81,Autism spectrum disorder,"Investigations of face processing in persons with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inform upon theories of the development of ""normal"" face processing, and the story that emerges challenges some models of the nature and origin of cortical face specialization. Individuals with an ASD possess deficits in face processing and a lack of a fusiform face area (FFA). Evidence from studies of ASD can be conceptualized best using an expertise framework of face processing rather than models that postulate a face module in the fusiform gyrus. Because persons with an ASD have reduced social interest, they may fail to develop cortical face specialization. Face specialization may develop in normal individuals because they are socially motivated to regard the face, and such motivation promotes expertise for faces. The amygdala is likely the key node in the system that marks objects as emotionally salient and could be crucial to the development of cortical face specialization.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. There are no drugs to treat the core symptoms. De novo mutations often play an important role in ASD and multiple high-risk loci have been identified in the last decade. These mutations range from copy number variants to small insertion/deletion and single nucleotide variants. Large-scale exome sequencing has identified over 100 risk genes that are associated with ASD. Both etiological heterogeneity and unavailability of human neurons remain major hurdles in understanding the pathophysiology of ASD and testing of new drug candidates. Hence, the most achievable and relevant model to screen for potential drugs is human neurons from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), including those from individuals with genetic mutations. In this study, we tested stem cells from individuals carrying mutations in ADNP, FOXP1 or SHANK3. They were scaled and reprogrammed to glutamatergic neurons and assessed for the effects of their specific mutations on neurite outgrowth. High Content Analysis allowed us to observe phenotypic differences between ASD neurons compared to controls, in terms of neuron number, neurite number and neurite length per neuron. Further, neurons were derived from both patient derived and genetically modified iPSCs with DDX3X mutation which were tested against 5088 drug like compounds. We assessed individual compound effects on the induced neurons to determine if they elicited changes that would indicate neurite growth (neuroprotection) or, alternatively, reduce outgrowth and hence appear neurotoxic. This report includes all methods, phenotypic outcomes, and results for the largest ASD small molecule screening effort done to date.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)"" retains a consistent meaning, referring to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by particular deficits and differences in behavior and cognitive processing. Text A discusses the challenges in face processing among individuals with ASD, emphasizing deficits related to social interaction and emotional salience. Text B addresses the genetic and neurodevelopmental aspects of ASD, focusing on mutations and new research methods involving stem cells to understand the disorder better. Although the focus of Text B shifts towards a more genetic and molecular perspective on the disorder, the fundamental definition and characteristics attributed to ASD have not drifted significantly in terms of semantics or connotation. Both texts maintain the core understanding of ASD as a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition, reflecting an unchanged semantic usage over the different periods."
82,Autism spectrum disorder,"In a prospective long-term outcome study of a representative sample of teenage-onset anorexia nervosa (AN), 51 individuals with AN, recruited after community screening, were contrasted with 51 matched comparison cases at a mean age of 24 years (10 years after AN onset). All 102 cases had been examined at age 16 and 21 years. At 24 years all probands were interviewed regarding mental and physical health, and overall outcome was assessed. Ten-year outcome of teenage-onset AN seemed to be relatively favourable in that half of all cases were free from eating disorder (ED) and other axis I disorder. There were no deaths. However, one in four in the AN group had a persisting ED, 3 of whom still had AN. Lifetime diagnoses of affective disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were overrepresented in the AN group. Affective disorders coincided with the ED, and were not a problem after recovery from the ED. On the other hand, OCD, OCPD (obsessive-compulsive personality disorder), and/or autism spectrum disorder continued to characterise more than one-third of the AN cases. One in six of the AN group had persistent problems with social interaction and obsessive compulsive behaviours from childhood into early adult years. Half the AN group had a poor overall outcome. These were subjects with either persisting ED or lifelong problems with social interaction and obsessive compulsive behaviour.","The importance of diet and the gut-brain axis for brain health and cognitive function is increasingly acknowledged. Dietary interventions are tested for their potential to prevent and/or treat brain disorders. Intermittent fasting (IF), the abstinence or strong limitation of calories for 12 to 48 h, alternated with periods of regular food intake, has shown promising results on neurobiological health in animal models. In this review article, we discuss the potential benefits of IF on cognitive function and the possible effects on the prevention and progress of brain-related disorders in animals and humans. We do so by summarizing the effects of IF which through metabolic, cellular, and circadian mechanisms lead to anatomical and functional changes in the brain. Our review shows that there is no clear evidence of a positive short-term effect of IF on cognition in healthy subjects. Clinical studies show benefits of IF for epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis on disease symptoms and progress. Findings from animal studies show mechanisms by which Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, autism spectrum disorder, and mood and anxiety disorders could benefit from IF. Future research should disentangle whether positive effects of IF hold true regardless of age or the presence of obesity. Moreover, variations in fasting patterns, total caloric intake, and intake of specific nutrients may be relevant components of IF success. Longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) will provide a window into the long-term effects of IF on the development and progress of brain-related diseases.","###Answer:
- **Label**: Changed
- **Reason**: In Text A, ""autism spectrum disorder"" is mentioned as a continued characteristic among a specific group of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), explaining its co-occurrence with persisting issues like social interaction difficulties and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Here, autism spectrum disorder is portrayed more as a secondary diagnostic consideration or comorbidity in a study primarily about eating disorders. In Text B, however, ""autism spectrum disorder"" is integrated into a broader scientific discussion on neurobiological health and its possible improvements through dietary interventions like intermittent fasting (IF). This mention aligns autism spectrum disorder with other major neurological and mood disorders, emphasizing potential benefits of dietary strategies on its symptoms and progression. The shift from a comorbid condition in a specific clinical population to a central consideration in generalized neurological wellness and intervention research indicates a significant broadening in the context and implication of autism spectrum disorder, suggesting a semantic evolution towards a more integrated role in neurobiological health discussions over these years."
83,Autism spectrum disorder,"Family studies have demonstrated that the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a major genetic etiologic component, but expression and penetrance of the phenotype are variable.

Children with ASD who were free of syntactic deficits demonstrated age-appropriate word knowledge. Children with ASD plus concomitant syntactic language impairments (ASDLI) performed similarly to peers with specific language impairment (SLI) and both demonstrated sparse lexicons characterized by partial word knowledge and immature knowledge of word-to-word relationships. This behavioral overlap speaks to the robustness of the syntax-lexicon interface and points to a similarity in the ASDLI and SLI phenotypes.","- Label: Unchanged

Text A discusses the genetic components and research involving mouse models related to autism phenotypes. Text B examines language and syntax capabilities in children diagnosed with ASD, comparing them with other developmental conditions but still framing it within the scope of autism spectrum disorders. Both texts use the term in a clinical, diagnostic sense related to behavioral and neurological characteristics, indicating that the core meaning of the term has not shifted significantly over time."

In this article, we address challenges related to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in this age group. We provide a comprehensive review of findings from recent studies on the early development of children with autism spectrum disorders, summarizing current knowledge on early signs of autism spectrum disorders, the screening properties of early detection tools, and current best practice for diagnostic assessment of autism spectrum disorders before 2 years of age. We also outline principles of effective intervention for children under the age of 2 with suspected/confirmed autism spectrum disorders.

Text A focuses on a scientific study examining the effects of a treatment on ASD symptoms, while Text B discusses early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for ASD in young children. Despite the different specific focuses, the underlying understanding and usage of the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" remain consistent between the two texts.

85,Autism spectrum disorder,"The aim of this study was to examine the comorbidity pattern, seizure characteristics, and aetiology in a representative group of children with a combination of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), active epilepsy, and learning disability. Ninety children (47 males, 43 females; mean age 11 years 2 months, range 8 to 16 years at the time of psychiatric examination) with active epilepsy and learning disability, identified in a population-based study in Göteborg, Sweden, were subdivided into those with and those without ASD and compared with respect to aetiology, additional neuroimpairments, and seizure characteristics. In addition, the cohorts were examined for trends of prevalence over a period of time. Results indicated that established aetiology was much more often present in the prenatal period than in the peri- or postnatal periods in the ASD group. Cerebral palsy and visual impairment were under-represented in the ASD group. Partial seizures tended to be more common and generalized seizures less common in the ASD group compared with the non-ASD group. Seizure onset was later in the ASD group. Many of the significant differences were accounted for by a large group of psychiatrically unclassifiable participants in the non-ASD group. There was no trend towards an increase of affected children over the 12-year period. There was no increase in the prevalence of active epilepsy and learning disability nor in the rate of autism with active epilepsy and learning disability in children born between 1981 and 1986 compared with those born from 1976 to 1980, indicating no statistical association with the general measles-mumps-rubella vaccination introduced in the early 1980s.","A number of studies have demonstrated that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are faster or more successful than typically developing control participants at various visual-attentional tasks (for reviews, see Dakin and Frith in Neuron 48:497-507, 2005; Simmons et al. in Vis Res 49:2705-2739, 2009). This ""ASD advantage"" was first identified in the domain of visual search by Plaisted et al. (J Child Psychol Psychiatry 39:777-783, 1998). Here we survey the findings of visual search studies from the past 15 years that contrasted the performance of individuals with and without ASD. Although there are some minor caveats, the overall consensus is that-across development and a broad range of symptom severity-individuals with ASD reliably outperform controls on visual search. The etiology of the ASD advantage has not been formally specified, but has been commonly attributed to 'enhanced perceptual discrimination', a superior ability to visually discriminate between targets and distractors in such tasks (e.g. O'Riordan in Cognition 77:81-96, 2000). As well, there is considerable evidence for impairments of the attentional network in ASD (for a review, see Keehn et al. in J Child Psychol Psychiatry 37:164-183, 2013). We discuss some recent results from our laboratory that support an attentional, rather than perceptual explanation for the ASD advantage in visual search. We speculate that this new conceptualization may offer a better understanding of some of the behavioral symptoms associated with ASD, such as over-focusing and restricted interests.

- Reason: Despite the different focuses and details expressed in Text A and Text B, the core usage of the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) remains consistent between the two texts. Text A explores the comorbidity pattern, seizure characteristics, and aetiology among children with autism spectrum disorder, emphasizing the neurological and clinical aspects of ASD. Text B discusses cognitive and perceptual advantages in individuals with ASD in visual-attentional tasks, emphasizing aspects like enhanced perceptual discrimination and attentional network impairments. Both texts employ the term to refer to a range of conditions related to developmental disorders that affect communication, behavior, and social interaction, demonstrating that the fundamental understanding and clinical implications associated with autism spectrum disorder have not substantially drifted over the years in scientific and medical discourse."
86,Autism spectrum disorder,"The methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene has recently been identified as the gene responsible for Rett syndrome (RS), a pervasive developmental disorder considered by many to be one of the autism spectrum disorders. Most female patients with MeCP2 mutations exhibit the classic features of RS, including autistic behaviors. Most male patients with MeCP2 mutations exhibit moderate to severe developmental delay/mental retardation. Ninety nine patients from the South Carolina autism project (SCAP) were screened for MeCP2 mutations, including all 41 female patients from whom DNA samples were available plus the 58 male patients with the lowest scores on standard IQ tests and/or the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. No pathogenic mutations were observed in these patients. One patient had the C582T variant, previously reported in the unaffected father of an RS patient. Two other patients had single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3' UTR of the gene, G1470A and C1516G. These variants were seen in 12/82 and 1/178 phenotypically normal male controls, respectively. The findings from this and other studies suggest that mutations in the coding sequence of the MeCP2 gene are not a significant etiological factor in autism.","No robust biomarkers have yet been identified for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autistic traits. Familial factors likely influence biomarkers such as protein concentrations. Comparing twins with ASD or high autistic traits to the less affected co-twin allows estimating the impact of familial confounding. We measured 203 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (n = 86) and serum (n = 127) in twins (mean age 14.2 years, 44.9% females) enriched for ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Autistic traits were assessed by using the parent-report version of the Social Responsiveness Scale-2. In cerebrospinal fluid, autistic traits correlated negatively with three proteins and positively with one. In serum, autistic traits correlated positively with 15 and negatively with one. Also in serum, six were positively-and one negatively-associated with ASD. A pathway analysis of these proteins revealed immune system enrichment. In within twin pair analyses, autistic traits were associated with serum B-cell activating factor (BAFF) only, whereas Cystatin B (CSTB) remained significantly associated with ASD. These associations did not remain significant when only considering monozygotic twins. For the remainder, the within-pair analysis indicated familial confounding, including shared environment and genes, influencing both autism and protein levels. Our findings indicate proteins involved in immunity as putative biomarkers of autistic traits and ASD with partial genetic confounding. Although some results are in line with previous studies in general, further studies are needed for replication.","- Label: Unchanged

Both texts explore the biological and genetic investigations relating to ASD. Text A discusses the association of the MeCP2 gene with Rett syndrome and autism spectrum disorders in a genetic study context. Text B focuses on potential biomarkers for ASD, analyzing proteins linked to autistic traits within a twin study. Importantly, in both texts, ""Autism spectrum disorder"" broadly defines a condition affecting developmental and communication traits, with significant interest in the genetic and biological basis of the disorder.

87,Autism spectrum disorder,"Brain tissue research has developed into a high-tech, multifaceted approach to understanding neurological disorders. Directed toward autism spectrum disorders, this investigative approach combines with other disciplines, such as imaging and genetics, to help explain the range and intensity of behaviors that characterize these disorders. This report is intended as an update on current autism brain research efforts and has a dual purpose: first, to disseminate information to the scientific community in the hope of stimulating more thinking about autism research and future collaborations; and second, to let the autism community know what is happening with this precious resource that was donated in the hope of determining the cause of autism and finding effective treatments.","Identifying disease genes from a vast amount of genetic data is one of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era. Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

88,Autism spectrum disorder,This paper outlines the possibility that disruption of cell-to-cell biochemical signaling activates a cascade of events resulting in a diverse spectrum of behavioral and biological symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders.,"Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have to address various challenges mainly due to their children's atypia related to communication, emotion regulation and behaviors, arising also within the relationship with their caregivers. Several studies have pointed out that children with ASD can exhibit many difficulties regarding initiating and maintaining meaningful relationships with others. To date, little research has explored the interactions between children with ASD and their fathers, focusing more on mothers. In the context of parent-child interactions in the presence of autism, recent studies have highlighted the importance of parental attunement but there is little research considering solely the affective-bodily dimension. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the parental attunement in fathers of children with ASD observed during play interactions and to investigate the relationship between paternal attunement and the perception of their psychological characteristics related to care relationships. The results highlight that fathers who describe themselves as better in affective care and sensitivity toward others more likely have an absence of paternal attunement during play interactions. The data presented are discussed in the light of intervention hypotheses, aimed at improving the relationship between fathers and children with autism.","###Label:

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) retains its meaning linked to a condition characterized by a range of behavioral and biological symptoms affecting communication and social interactions. Text A discusses the disorder in terms of biological and behavioral phenomena, focusing on the effects at a biochemical signaling level. Text B, while exploring the social dynamics and challenges faced by parents, particularly fathers, still frames ASD in terms of its impact on communication, emotion regulation, and behavior. Both texts use the term to describe a developmental disorder marked by difficulties in social interaction and communication skills, along with restricted and repetitive behaviors, showing that the essential definition and understanding of ""autism spectrum disorder"" have remained consistent over time."
89,Autism spectrum disorder,"The present study extends our previous work on social behavior impairment in young males with fragile X syndrome (FraX). Specifically, we evaluated whether the autistic phenomenon in FraX is expressed as a range of behavioral impairments as in idiopathic autism (Aut). We also examined whether there are behaviors, identified as items of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), that in FraX predispose to or differentiate subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Finally, regression models were utilized to test the relative contribution of reduced communication and socialization skills to ADI-R scores and diagnoses. A cohort of 56 boys (3-8 years) with FraX was examined in terms of scores on measures of cognition (IQ was a co-variate in most analyses.), autistic behavior, problem/aberrant behavior, adaptive behavior, and language development. We found that, indeed, in terms of problem behavior and adaptive skills, there is a range of severity from FraX + Aut to FraX + PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder) to FraX + none. ADI-R items representing ""Play"" types of interaction appear to be ""susceptibility"" factors since they were abnormal across the FraX cohort. Integrated regression models demonstrated that items reflecting complex social interaction differentiated the FraX + ASD (Aut + PDD) subgroup from the rest of the FraX cohort, while abnormalities in basic verbal and non-verbal communication distinguished the most severely affected boys with FraX + Aut from the milder FraX + PDD cohort. Models incorporating language, adaptive communication, and adaptive socialization skills revealed that socialization was not only the main influence on scores but also a predictor of ASD diagnosis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the diagnosis of ASD in FraX reflects, to a large extent, an impairment in social interaction that is expressed with variable severity in young males with FraX.","Autism Spectrum Disorders are characterized by difficulties in communicating and cooperating with other people. Impairment in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer what another person is thinking, may contribute to these social deficits. The present study assesses the relationship between autistic traits and decision-making in a socioeconomic game environment that measures ToM and cooperation. We quantified participant strategy during game play with computer agents that simulated aspects of ToM or fixed strategy agents with static behaviors or heuristics. Individuals with higher Autism Quotient (AQ) scores cooperated less than subjects with low AQ scores with the ToM agents. In contrast, subjects with higher AQ scores cooperated more with fixed strategy agents. Additionally, subjects with higher AQ scores spent more time than low AQ subjects signaling cooperative intent in games with fixed strategy agents while spending less time signaling cooperation with adaptive agents, indicating a preference toward systemizing behaviors in the face of uncertainty. We conclude that individuals with high levels of autistic traits are less likely to utilize ToM as a cognitive strategy, even when it is beneficial, to achieve a desired outcome.","###Label:

###Reason:
The usage of the term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) in both Text A and Text B maintains a consistent focus on its core aspect: challenges or impairments in social interactions and communication skills among individuals with this condition. 

In Text A, autism spectrum disorder is discussed in the context of specific behavioral impairments associated with Fragile X syndrome, focusing on social interaction deficits and how these vary among individuals with different severities of the disorder. Text A also examines how autistic behaviors and socialization deficits contribute to ASD diagnosis using established diagnostic criteria.

Text B, while using a different approach and context, still centers on the characteristic difficulties of ASD, particularly in social cognition and theory of mind (ToM) which affects communication and interaction with others. This text delves into how individuals with higher levels of autistic traits exhibit distinctive patterns of behavior in social games compared to those with lower traits, particularly in their abilities to use ToM as a strategy in interactions.

Both texts, despite being from different studies and potentially different times, highlight the primary and established characteristics of autism spectrum disorder related to communication and social interaction difficulties. There is no evidence of a fundamental change in the conceptualization of ASD between these texts. The focus remains on the impairments in social skills and communication abilities as core features of the disorder, indicating that the semantic meaning of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" has remained largely unchanged."
90,Autism spectrum disorder,"Joint attention (JA) initiation is defined in cognitive-developmental psychology as a child's actions that verify or produce simultaneous attending by that child and an adult to some object or event in the environment so that both may experience the object or event together.

The analysis describes reinforcer-establishing and evocative effects of antecedent objects or events, discriminative and conditioned reinforcing functions of stimuli generated by adult behavior, and socially mediated reinforcers that may maintain JA behavior. A functional analysis of JA may describe multiple operant classes.

We utilized data from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a case-control study among 2- to 5-year-old children born between 2003 and 2006 in the United States, to explore a possible association between maternal infection and fever during pregnancy and risk of ASD and other developmental disorders (DDs). Three groups of children were included: children with ASD (N = 606) and children with DDs (N = 856), ascertained from clinical and educational sources, and children from the general population (N = 796), randomly sampled from state birth records. Information about infection and fever during pregnancy was obtained from a telephone interview with the mother shortly after study enrollment and maternal prenatal and labor/delivery medical records. ASD and DD status was determined by an in-person standardized developmental assessment of the child at 3-5 years of age. After adjustment for covariates, maternal infection anytime during pregnancy was not associated with ASD or DDs. However, second trimester infection accompanied by fever elevated risk for ASD approximately twofold (aOR = 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.14-4.23). These findings of an association between maternal infection with fever in the second trimester and increased risk of ASD in the offspring suggest that the inflammatory response to the infectious agent may be etiologically relevant.

LAY SUMMARY: Using data from a large multisite study in the United States-the Study to Explore Early Development-we found that women who had an infection during the second trimester of pregnancy accompanied by a fever are more likely to have children with ASD. These findings suggest the possibility that only more severe infections accompanied by a robust inflammatory response increase the risk of ASD.","- Label: Unchanged

91,Autism spectrum disorder,"Twin and family studies suggest that familial transmission in autism extends to a spectrum of social and behavioral deficits that characterize individuals who have significant impairments within the autism spectrum, but do not meet formal criteria for autistic disorder. Standardized diagnostic instruments, including the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-WPS Edition), offer the opportunity to quantify deficits across the autism spectrum, controlling effects of language and cognitive delay, in individuals with significant impairments. It is suggested that quantitative measures of social reciprocity and repetitive behaviors and interests, with separate quantification of expressive language level and nonverbal intelligence, most accurately reflect the range of behavioral phenotypes in autism spectrum disorders.","Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at high spatial resolution can detect potential foci of early brain dysmaturation in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In addition, comparison between MRI and behavior measures over time can identify patterns of brain change accompanying specific outcomes. We report structural MRI data from two time points for a total of 84 scans in children with ASD and 30 scans in typical controls (mean age time one = 4.1 years, mean age at time two = 6.6 years). Surface-based cortical morphometry and linear mixed effects models were used to link changes in cortical anatomy to both diagnostic status and individual differences in changes in language and autism severity. Compared with controls, children with ASD showed accelerated gray matter volume gain with age, which was driven by a lack of typical age-related cortical thickness (CT) decrease within 10 cortical regions involved in language, social cognition, and behavioral control. Greater expressive communication gains with age in children with ASD were associated with greater CT gains in a set of right hemisphere homologues to dominant language cortices, potentially identifying a compensatory system for closer translational study.

92,Autism spectrum disorder,"Rearrangements of chromosome 15q, including isodicentric 15 chromosomes and interstitial duplications and triplications, have been previously reported in association with autism spectrum disorders. We have identified two boys with exceptionally large der(15) chromosomes that are tricentric and contain four copies of the proximal long arm, including the Prader Willi/Angelman critical region, and leading to hexasomy of the involved segment. Biallelic inheritance of maternal alleles and methylation analysis indicate that the markers are maternally derived. Clinical assessment of the boys indicated severe cognitive impairment associated with marked delays in gross and fine motor skills. Social and language deficits were present in both, although the severity of the mental retardation precluded diagnosis of autism (both were considered to have pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified).

- Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD) retains essentially the same fundamental meaning which relates to a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction, communication, and often accompanied by repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. 

Text A discusses specific genetic abnormalities associated with autism spectrum disorders, highlighting the severe end of the spectrum characterized by complex genetic conditions and profound developmental issues. Here, the focus is on the genetic underpinnings and clinical manifestations of ASD.

Text B shifts the focus towards technological advances in diagnosis and examination of ASD through modern machine learning techniques and imaging but still centers around identifying and understanding autism spectrum disorders. The use of innovative diagnostic methods does not alter the underlying definition of ASD; rather, it builds upon the base concept to enhance diagnostic accuracy and understanding of the disorder's neurological basis.

Between both texts, despite the differences in specific focus areas (genetic markers in Text A and diagnostic technology in Text B), the core concept of ""autism spectrum disorder"" as a range of developmental issues remains consistent.

93,Autism spectrum disorder,"Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) refer to the group of heterogeneous conditions that make up a continuum or spectrum of autistic disorders and share a core triad of impairments consisting of qualitative disturbances in social interaction and verbal and nonverbal communication and imagination. It has long been believed that the prevalence of autism was 2-4 per 10,000 children. However, studies using broader definitions of autistic disorder have suggested that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder may be as high as 90 per 10,000 and that a greater proportion of individuals with PDD have intellectual levels above 70. Clinicians and researchers have commented on the apparent increase in prevalence of the disorder and have offered a number of explanations, including better recognition and diagnosis of the autism spectrum of disorders and a real increase in the disturbance. It is being increasingly recognized that individuals with PDD are at risk for a wide array of psychiatric disturbances, including affective disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia-like psychosis, aggression, antisocial behavior, and Tourette's disorder (TD). Evidence indicates that PDD is significantly related to the comorbid psychiatric disorders and TD. Because PDD is not rare, individuals with autism spectrum disorder may represent significant subgroups of severely emotionally disturbed patients referred for psychiatric treatment. Because of lack of awareness that the clinical manifestations of PDD are heterogeneous and often mild and that comorbid psychiatric disturbances may obscure the symptoms of the developmental disorder, the diagnosis of PDD may be missed. Implications for practicing clinicians are discussed.","Along with social, cognitive, and behavior deficiencies, peculiarities in sensory processing, including an atypical global motion processing, have been reported in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The question about the enhanced motion pooling in ASD is still debatable. The aim of the present study was to compare global motion integration in ASD using a low-density display and the equivalent noise (EN) approach. Fifty-seven children and adolescents with ASD or with typical development (TD) had to determine the average direction of movement of 30 Laplacian-of-Gaussian micro-patterns. They moved in directions determined by a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 2°, 5°, 10°, 15°, 25°, and 35°, corresponding to the added external noise. The data obtained showed that the ASD group has much larger individual differences in motion direction thresholds on external noise effect than the TD group. Applying the equivalent noise paradigm, we found that the global motion direction discrimination thresholds were more elevated in ASD than in controls at all noise levels. These results suggest that ASD individuals have a poor ability to integrate the local motion information in low-density displays.","### Label:

### Reason:
The use of the term ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (ASD) in both Text A and Text B refers consistently to a condition characterized by a spectrum of cognitive, social, and behavioral disturbances. What changes primarily between the texts is not the fundamental definition of ASD but rather the focal point of the investigations or observations described. Text A discusses the broader clinical and comorbid aspects of ASD, noting issues like social interaction, communication challenges, and an array of psychiatric disturbances that may accompany ASD. It touches on the spectrum nature and the diversity of symptoms and severities within the disorder, also highlighting diagnostic challenges.

Text B, while still focused on individuals with ASD, zeroes in more narrowly on a specific cognitive aspect—global motion processing. This is an extension of what is already acknowledged about ASD (issues with sensory processing are mentioned in Text A and explored in more specific detail in Text B). The fundamental understanding and definition of ASD as encompassing a range of developmental issues remain consistent across both texts despite differing aspects being discussed.

Thus, the semantic meaning of ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" remains largely the same between the texts from different periods, focusing on it as a spectrum of disorders affecting social skills, communication, behavioral patterns, and occasionally sensory processing without a fundamental shift in the meaning or use of the term."

Text B extends the dialogue on ASD to include the potential impact of nutrition on the disorder, exploring how diet might influence the development and manifestation of ASD or alleviate its symptoms. Although Text B introduces an additional dimension (nutritional influence) to the discussion of ASD, the fundamental meaning and perception of ASD as a developmental disorder related to communication and interaction difficulties remain consistent across both texts. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift in the understanding or use of ""Autism spectrum disorder"" between these texts from potentially different periods."

The prevalence of tuberous sclerosis complex in the autism spectrum disorder population is 1 to 4%, whereas features of autism spectrum disorder are present in 25 to 50% of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex. The underlying reason for this association might be a nonspecific disruption of brain function owing to tuberous sclerosis complex, including tuber location, seizures and their effect on brain development, cognitive impairment, a disturbance in brain development in regions associated with autism spectrum disorder, or, less likely, a linkage between a TSC gene and an autism susceptibility gene. Awareness of the relationship between autism spectrum disorder and tuberous sclerosis complex is important during the evaluation of individuals with either disorder. Better delineation of the association and its causative factors is needed for the development of possible interventions.","Background. Previous research has supported gender-specific aetiological factors in oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD).

Methods. 17,220 twins aged 9 or 12 were screened using the Autism-Tics, AD/HD and other Comorbidities inventory. The main covariates of ODD- and CD-like problems were investigated, and the relative importance of unique versus shared hereditary and environmental effects was estimated using twin model fitting. Results. Social interaction problems (one of the ASD subdomains) was the strongest neurodevelopmental covariate of the behavioural problems in both genders, while ADHD-related hyperactivity/impulsiveness in boys and inattention in girls stood out as important covariates of CD-like problems. Genetic effects accounted for 50%-62% of the variance in behavioural problems, except in CD-like problems in girls (26%). Genetic and environmental effects linked to ADHD and ASD also influenced ODD-like problems in both genders and, to a lesser extent, CD-like problems in boys, but not in girls. Conclusions.

In Text B, ASD is discussed in relation to its interaction with other behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD), particularly in a genetic and gender-specific context. This text further explores how ASD correlates with other behavioral problems and emphasizes the genetic component and neurodevelopmental covariance.

In both texts, ASD is consistently portrayed as a neurodevelopmental condition with a significant genetic component and its interaction with other disorders or conditions.

Text B refers similarly to ASD as one of the behavioral health conditions among children, mentioning it in the context of a statistical analysis to determine healthcare needs and disparities in a study. The underlying concept and identification of ASD as a neurological and developmental disorder remain consistent across both texts, confirming that the term has retained its core clinical and behavioral significance over time.

Together with this evolving knowledge, a series of ethical arguments concerning the indication of surgical treatment in patients with minor forms of trigonocephaly with autistic behaviors and/or hyperactivity leads us to hypothesize the presence of an autism subtype which may frequently be accompanied by specific morphological skull characteristics (autistic skull shape).","Autistic people have communication, sensorial, and social difficulties, which on many occasions, make their adaptation on the sexual and affective levels difficult. For this reason, it is important to know the opinion of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their families, to offer this perspective to professionals to facilitate adapted health education programs in mental health units.","- **Label:** Changed

- **Reason:**
In Text A, the mention of ""autism spectrum disorder"" primarily focuses on a scientific and genomic perspective, emphasizing the possible genetic predispositions and the biological underpinnings related to skull development associated with the disorder. The usage here is heavily tilted towards a clinical and genetic exploration that is interested in categorizing types of autism based on physical and genetic markers. 

On the other hand, Text B approaches ""autism spectrum disorder"" from a more humanistic and social perspective. The emphasis is on the communicative, sensorial, and social challenges faced by autistic individuals and the importance of incorporating their perspectives and needs into health education programs. This implies a broader societal and personal understanding of the disorder, not just focusing on the clinical or biological aspects but also on the complexities of everyday living and integration into society.

Thus, the semantic drift in the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" between the two texts suggests a shift from a strictly biomedical view to a more integrative and empathetic understanding that respects the lived experiences and social inclusion of autistic individuals."
98,Autism spectrum disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) frequently occur in patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It has been suggested that genetic factors play a role in the transmission of both TS and ASD and that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may have some genetic relationship with these disorders. The objective of this study was to explore whether the OCS associated with TS and ASD were found in the parents of TS and ASD probands by comparing them with normal controls. The subjects were parents of 13 TS and 16 ASD probands. All parents underwent an examination for tic symptoms and OCD, and completed the Maudsley Obsessional Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). No significant differences were observed in the MOCI and STAI scores among all three groups. However, the MOCI total score was higher in fathers of ASD probands than in male normal controls with a marginal significance. There was a significant tendency for the mean cleaning score of MOCI in fathers of ASD probands to be higher than that in male normal controls, and the mean checking score in fathers of ASD probands was fourfold higher than that in male normal controls, although there was no significant difference. No significant relationship was observed between OCS in TS or ASD probands and OCS of their parents. Further studies on OCD and OCS including a dimensional approach within ASD families are needed.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Although anxiety is a common major psychiatric condition in ASD, the underlying mechanisms of the anxiety are poorly understood. In individuals with ASD, evidence indicates a structural abnormality in the amygdala, a key component involved in anxiety and social behavior. Microglia, which are central nervous system-resident immune cells implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, are also reportedly altered in ASD. In the present study, we examined the involvement of microglia in the anxiety-related behaviors of ASD model mouse.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"" refers consistently to a condition associated with genetic and neurodevelopmental factors, with associative symptoms and impairments. In Text A, ASD is examined with regard to its genetic relationships and how such associations might manifest phenotypically in families. In Text B, ASD is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic influences as well, emphasizing abnormalities in brain structure and the potential role of microglia. Both texts maintain a focus on ASD as a disorder with a basis in neurodevelopmental and genetic components, preserving this central understanding across the years."
99,Autism spectrum disorder,"We report two children who were referred for diagnostic assessment for autism and were subsequently determined to have a muscular dystrophy (MD). Each child had a history of speech delay and social impairments, but also had motor delays that had not previously been investigated. Both children met diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders on standardized assessment. Each child was hypotonic and had other mild motor impairments. Serum creatine kinase (CK) activity was markedly elevated in each child, and subsequent muscle biopsy led to diagnosis of Becker's MD and congenital (autosomal recessive) MD, respectively. These cases highlight the importance of a thorough neuromotor examination for all children with suspected autism spectrum disorders.","The present study examined fixation frequency and duration during an Embedded Figures Test (EFT) in an effort to better understand the attentional and perceptual processes by which individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) achieve accelerated EFT performance. In particular, we aimed to elucidate differences in the patterns of eye-movement in ASD and typically developing (TD) children, thus providing evidence relevant to the competing theories of weak central coherence (WCC) and enhanced perceptual functioning. Consistent with prior EFT studies, we found accelerated response time (RT) in children with ASD. No group differences were seen for fixation frequency, but the ASD group made significantly shorter fixations compared to the TD group. Eye-movement results indicate that RT advantage in ASD is related to both WCC and enhanced perceptual functioning.","### Answer:
- Target word: Autism spectrum disorder
- Text A: The first text talks about children initially suspected of having autism spectrum disorders but later diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. The context focuses on the clinical diagnostic overlap and importance of comprehensive assessments beyond just behavioral and social impairments typically associated with autism. It emphasizes neuromotor examinations in suspected cases of autism due to shared symptoms with other conditions.
- Text B: Here, the focus shifts to a very specific aspect of cognitive and perceptual processes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, examining how these individuals perform in tests designed to measure visual perception and attention (Embedded Figures Test). The study details the attentional patterns and eye-movement metrics that may contribute to differences in how individuals with ASD process visual information compared to typically developing children.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: While the contexts and focuses of the two texts are different—one emphasizing clinical diagnostics and one looking at cognitive-perceptual research—the underlying meaning of the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" retains a consistent thread across both texts. The term is used to describe a developmental disability characterized by social, communication, and behavioral challenges, even though the specific aspects or manifestations discussed vary. One text uses the term within a diagnostic overlap scenario, while the other examines specific cognitive features of the condition. The core understanding and usage of the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" remain the same, indicating that there is no significant semantic drift in this term between the two contexts provided."
0,Dementia,"A rating scale measuring care status related to assistance with basic ADL for demented patients was developed. This instrument, named the ABCD, is designed to be completed by family and professional caregivers, and consists of two subscales assessing the level of difficulty of help with the ADL (difficulty scale) and the reasons why assistance is needed (reason category). In the difficulty scale, each of 6 items is rated with 4 possible responses corresponding to the degree of physical assistance from the caregiver and of the patient's cooperation with the assistance. In the reason category, for 5 activities excluding voiding, the reason is assessed with the following three possible responses: A; physical disability, B; disability in motivation and/or so-called apraxia, C; a combination of A and B. The ABCD was administered to 124 outpatients and 203 inpatients with dementia based on the DSM III-R criteria in order to test its reliability and validity. The data from the out- and inpatient samples were analyzed separately. The reliability study of the two subscales based on calculation of perfect agreement rates and kappa values indicated high test-retest and inter-rater reliability for both samples. The Cronbach alpha values of the difficulty scale were also high. As to the validity of the difficulty scale, there was a significantly high correlation between the score obtained with this scale and the results of two established assessment instruments. For the outpatients, logistic regression analysis revealed that the score obtained with this scale was the only predictor of institutionalization and mortality within 1 year after the baseline examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a continuous endothelial membrane within brain microvessels that has sealed cell-to-cell contacts and is sheathed by mural vascular cells and perivascular astrocyte end-feet. The BBB protects neurons from factors present in the systemic circulation and maintains the highly regulated CNS internal milieu, which is required for proper synaptic and neuronal functioning. BBB disruption allows influx into the brain of neurotoxic blood-derived debris, cells and microbial pathogens and is associated with inflammatory and immune responses, which can initiate multiple pathways of neurodegeneration. This Review discusses neuroimaging studies in the living human brain and post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies demonstrating BBB breakdown in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, HIV-1-associated dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms by which BBB breakdown leads to neuronal injury, synaptic dysfunction, loss of neuronal connectivity and neurodegeneration are described. The importance of a healthy BBB for therapeutic drug delivery and the adverse effects of disease-initiated, pathological BBB breakdown in relation to brain delivery of neuropharmaceuticals are briefly discussed. Finally, future directions, gaps in the field and opportunities to control the course of neurological diseases by targeting the BBB are presented.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dementia
- Text A: Here, dementia is discussed primarily in relation to a diagnostic and care-assessment context, focusing on methodologies needed to assist caregivers in evaluating and supporting patients with dementia. The purpose is clinical and diagnostic, dealing with the evaluation of daily living challenges and managing care based on a specific rating scale developed for dementia patients.
- Text B: In this text, dementia is approached from a biological and pathological standpoint, specifically focusing on how breakdowns in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contribute to various forms of neurodegeneration, including dementia. The discussion extends into the mechanisms by which BBB disruption is associated with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, reflecting a deeper dive into the underlying pathophysiology rather than just care and symptom management.

###Reason:
- The usage of the word ""dementia"" has undergone a significant semantic drift from Text A to Text B. In Text A, dementia is described from a care and management perspective, primarily focusing on its implications for daily activities and care requirements. In Text B, the emphasis is on the neurobiological aspects, linking the condition to broader neurodegenerative pathways and biological disruptions like the BBB. This reflects a shift from a care-management to a biological-pathological understanding of dementia, indicating a semantic change in its discussion and implications in medical literature over time."
1,Dementia,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been found to be important for maintaining optimal performance on a variety of cognitive tasks. In humans, nicotine-induced improvement of rapid information processing is particularly well documented. In experimental animals nicotine has been found to improve learning and memory on a variety of tasks, while the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine has been found to impair memory performance. Nicotine has been found to be effective in attenuating memory deficits resulting from lesions of the septohippocampal pathway or aging in experimental animals. Nicotinic receptors are decreased in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Preliminary studies have found that some aspects of the cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease can be attenuated by nicotine. Nicotine may prove to be useful therapeutic treatment for this and other types of dementia.","Diogenes syndrome (DS) is an acquired behavioural disturbance more often affecting elderly patients, but possible in all ages. It is characterised by social withdrawal, extreme self and house neglect, tendency to hoard any kind of objects/rubbish (syllogomania), and rejection against external help for lack of concern about one's condition. It is considered infrequent, but with quite high mortality. DS might be divided into several forms including Active (the patient gathers objects outside and accumulates them inside his house), Passive (patient invaded by his own rubbish), ""à deux"" (DS sharing between two people), and ""under-threshold"" (DS ""blocked"" by precocious intervention). Four cases are here presented. In case 1 (passive DS) alcoholism and cognitive impairment could be trigger factors for DS, predisposed by a ""personality alteration"". In case 2 (active, ""à trois"") superimposed psychosis could be the trigger, borderline intelligence being the predisposing factor. In case 3 (active), fronto-parietal internal hyperostosis might support an organic aetiology. Finally, case 4 was an example of isolated syllogomania in patient with evolving Alzheimer's dementia. Despite being heterogeneous, our casuistry suggest that DS can develop in both sexes, is prevalent in geriatric age and often associated with cognitive impairment/psychiatric disturbances, which are not specific, nor sufficient to justify DS. Isolated syllogomania only shares the characteristic hoarding with DS; although cognitive impairment might be present, the other DS typical aspects (social isolation, help refusal, characterial aspects, personal hygiene neglect) are absent. ","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dementia"" primarily refers to a cognitive decline typically associated with old age, specifically in the context of Alzheimer's disease and the exploration of potential treatments such as nicotine to ameliorate cognitive deficits. This denotes a focus on the biomedical and therapeutic aspects of dementia, targeting the improvement of memory and cognitive performance directly. Conversely, Text B addresses dementia in the broader context of a syndrome characterizing behavioral disturbances (Diogenes syndrome), which includes cognitive impairment as one of several symptoms. The emphasis is on the complex behavioral presentation and the socio-psychological impacts of dementia rather than solely on cognitive decline. This shift in context from a more narrowly focused biomedical perspective to a holistic, behavioral, and social understanding of dementia, incorporating various psychological conditions and lifestyle impacts, signifies a significant semantic drift in the usage of the word ""dementia"" over time."
2,Dementia,"Recent studies have shown that the neurodegenerative process in disorders with Lewy body formation, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is associated with alpha-synuclein accumulation and that beta-synuclein might protect the central nervous system from the neurotoxic effects of alpha-synuclein. However, the mechanisms are unclear. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the potential involvement of the serine threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) signaling pathway in the mechanisms of beta-synuclein neuroprotection. For this purpose, Akt activity and cell survival were analyzed in synuclein-transfected B103 neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons. Beta-synuclein transfection resulted in increased Akt activity and conferred protection from the neurotoxic effects of rotenone. Down-regulation of Akt expression resulted in an increased susceptibility to rotenone toxicity, whereas transfection with a lentiviral vector encoding for beta-synuclein was protective. The effects of beta-synuclein on the Akt pathway appear to be by direct interaction between these molecules and were independent of upstream signaling molecules. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanisms of beta-synuclein neuroprotection might involve direct interactions between beta-synuclein and Akt and suggest that this signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic target for neurological conditions associated with parkinsonism and alpha-synuclein aggregation.","Obesity is a major health problem, increasing the risk of various major chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and stroke. While the role of obesity identified by cross-sectional BMI recordings has been heavily studied, the role of BMI trajectories is much less explored. In this study, we use a machine learning approach to subtype individuals' risk of developing 18 major chronic diseases by using their BMI trajectories extracted from a large and geographically diverse EHR dataset capturing the health status of around two million individuals for a period of six years. We define nine new interpretable and evidence-based variables based on the BMI trajectories to cluster the patients into subgroups using the k-means clustering method. We thoroughly review each cluster's characteristics in terms of demographic, socioeconomic, and physiological measurement variables to specify the distinct properties of the patients in the clusters. In our experiments, the direct relationship of obesity with diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's, and dementia has been re-established and distinct clusters with specific characteristics for several of the chronic diseases have been found to be conforming or complementary to the existing body of knowledge.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term 'dementia' refers to a category of neurological conditions characterized by a decline in cognitive function, memory, and ability to perform everyday activities. Text A discusses 'dementia' in the context of neurodegenerative processes and synuclein accumulation specifically related to dementia with Lewy bodies. Text B, while addressing broader health issues including major chronic diseases, mentions dementia in the context of diseases associated with obesity and analyzed through data on BMI trajectories. Despite different focus areas within medical research, the underlying meaning of ""dementia"" as a neurological degenerative condition remains consistent across the two texts. Therefore, the usage of the word 'dementia' shows no significant semantic drift."
3,Dementia,"Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease manifests clinically as a form of presenile dementia. It is now known to be caused by a transmissible agent, probably a ""slow virus"".

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the semantic meaning and the context in which ""dementia"" is used remain consistent. Text A discusses dementia in relation to a specific disease (Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease), emphasizing it primarily as a clinical manifestation or symptom. Text B talks about dementia on a broader international and economic impact scale but still refers to it primarily as a medical condition affecting mental cognitive functions, particularly in the older population.

- Reason: In the provided examples, the context and focus surrounding the term ""dementia"" demonstrate a significant shift in how it's discussed and understood over the periods referenced in Text A and Text B. Text A focuses on behavioral complications (sexual acting out) in dementia patients, exploring symptomatic management of secondary behavioral issues associated with different types of dementia. Here, dementia is looked at more from a symptom management perspective in a clinical setting, which emphasizes practical caregiving challenges.

In contrast, Text B delves deep into a specific subtype of dementia, Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), discussing its association with broader neuropathological conditions including Alzheimer's and frontotemporal degeneration. The focus is not just on symptom management but on understanding the underlying neuroanatomic and neuropathological facets, implying a shift towards a more nuanced scientific understanding of dementia as a complex neurological condition with specific subtypes, rather than simply a collection of symptoms to be managed. This represents an evolution in the discourse from direct caregiving challenges to a sophisticated, research-oriented exploration of the causes, types, and mechanisms of dementia."
5,Dementia,"We report transient dementia in a 71-year-old woman, that was caused by hyperthyroidism of painless thyroiditis. Her friends, who found her very forgetful and performing abnormal behavior, brought her to our hospital. She looked alert and cooperative. There was neither goiter nor pain of the thyroid. Neurological examination revealed impairment of recent memory with a low score of memory test (MMSE: 20/30) indicating mild dementia. EEG showed slow alpha waves (8 Hz) with random theta and delta waves in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally. MRI showed mild diffuse atrophy of the brain, and SPECT revealed diffuse decrease in the cerebral blood flow most predominantly in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally. Abnormal findings included low levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), high levels of free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine. Antithyrogloblin antibody was positive and TSH receptor antibody was negative, while CRP was normal. Radioactive Tc uptake of the thyroid gland was low. A diagnosis of painless thyroiditis was made. Thyroid function turned to euthyroid state spontaneously in four weeks without antithyroid therapy, and subsequently memory disturbance and abnormal behavior disappeared. SPECT after clinical recovery showed improvement in the cerebral blood flow of the frontotemporal lobes. To our knowledge, dementia-like symptoms secondary to hyperthyroidism of painless thyroiditis have not been reported previously, and should be kept in mind as one of the causes of treatable dementia.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia occurring in human population. The disorder is characterized clinically by memory loss and histopathologically by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in patient's brain. Accuracy of the clinal diagnosis of AD is quite variable (-60 to 95 %), leaving a significant number of AD patients undiagnosed or falsely positively diagnosed. Therefore there is a requirement for biological markers, which would unambiguously discriminate living AD patients from other non-AD individuals. Until now a few diagnostic biomarkers for AD have been identified, which can be divided in two groups: protein markers and genetic markers. The most significant protein biomarkers are levels of tau proteins, ubiquitin and amyloid beta-peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Among genetic AD markers, the most relevant are allelic variants of gene for apolipoprotein E and point mutations in genes coding for amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 and 2. Nevertheless, neither of recent biomarkers allow the ultimate AD diagnosis, because the disease is multifactorial and heterogenous. Identification of various subgroups of AD will help improvement in diagnoses and development of potent therapeutic drugs (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 53).","### Label: Unchanged

In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dementia"" refers to a clinical syndrome characterized by a decline in cognitive function severe enough to interfere with everyday abilities. It encompasses various symptoms and disease entities defined by impairment in memory, thinking, and/or social abilities. 

- **Text A** discusses a case of transient dementia induced by hyperthyroidism, emphasizing the clinical manifestation of memory impairment and other cognitive dysfunction during the condition. Despite being a temporary situation triggered by an endocrine disorder, the usage aligns with the general understanding of dementia as primarily concerned with memory and cognitive impairment.

- **Text B** provides insight into Alzheimer's disease, which is a specific cause of enduring dementia. The text underscores the typical pathological and clinical features associated with Alzheimer's, such as memory loss. This continues to align with the broader definition of dementia as severe cognitive decline.

Both texts, despite their focus on different causes and specifics (transient vs. long-term, thyroid-related vs. Alzheimer's-specific), essentially use ""dementia"" to denote significant cognitive decline, particularly impacting memory. Thus, the underlying meaning of the word ""dementia"" remains consistent, reflecting a lack of semantic drift over the observed period."
6,Dementia,"We describe a 57-year-old man (MW) with frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fv-FTD) who presented with a long history of drinking problem and marital disharmony followed by gradual changes in personality with disinhibition, stereotypic checking, overeating and a decline in self-care. Structural MRI imaging confirmed marked frontal atrophy involving particularly the ventromedial region. Performance on standard tests of frontal executive function was largely unremarkable and MW obtained a perfect score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In contrast, an experimental battery of tasks designed to evaluate theory of mind (ToM) revealed marked deficits. MW's challenging and disruptive behaviours, notably obsessive checking of car suspension by rocking, and wandering, responded to behavioural modification regimes adapted from the neurorehabilitation literature. In conclusion, deficits in ToM may underline the gross abnormalities in social conduct, which characterise fv-FTD; ToM appears to dissociate from frontal executive function; and behavioural modification approaches can be of benefit in this disorder.","Dementia is characterized by significant declines in cognitive, physical, social, and behavioral functioning, and includes multiple subtypes that differ in etiology.

- Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is used to refer to a condition marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as memory, reasoning, and behavioral abilities. Text A discusses a specific case of frontotemporal dementia (fv-FTD), detailing symptoms and the effect on social behaviors and personality. It reflects a particular subtype that involves marked abnormalities in social conduct and describes how behavioral modifications can help manage some of the disruptive behaviors. 

Text B focuses on dementia more broadly, exploring the influence of psychiatric and substance use history on the risk of dementia subtypes like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) in a diverse demographic group. It maintains the central concept of dementia as a decline in multiple areas of functioning, including cognitive and social aspects. 

Both texts, although discussing different aspects and subtypes of dementia, maintain the core meaning of ""dementia"" as a decline in cognitive and functional abilities over a period of time. The subtle differences in focus between the clinical specifics in Text A and epidemiological factors in Text B do not constitute a shift in the fundamental meaning of the term ""dementia.""

7,Dementia,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on Guam previously attained incidence rates 50 to 100 times that of the continental United States and Europe and accounted for one in five deaths among Chamorros over age 25. A second neurological disorder in high incidence, parkinsonism-dementia (PD), and the early appearance in those populations of neurofibrillary tangles such as are seen in Alzheimer's disease and normal ageing have also been noted. Incidence and mortality rates of both diseases have declined dramatically during the past 30 years, and today, the risk of developing either disease among Guamanian Chamorros is only several times higher than in non-Guamanian populations. The decline is most likely a consequence of increased acculturation over the past three decades, with a concomitant decrease in isolation, changes in dietary habits and local water supplies, and much less dependence on locally grown foodstuffs. Similar declines are evident in the remaining two Pacific foci of high- incidence ALS, namely the Kii Peninsula focus in Japan and southern West New Guinea where western contact and introduction of new foodstuffs have occurred.The accumulating epidemiological, genetic and environmental evidence, as well as the development of new and promising experimental animal models, support the hypothesis that a basic metabolic defect, provoked by chronic nutritional deficiencies of calcium, lead to increased intestinal absorption of toxic metals and the co-deposition of calcium, aluminium and silicon in neurons of patients with ALS and PD. This elemental deposition is thought to result in aberrant microtubule assembly and/or abnormal post-translational modification of the amyloid precursor protein leading to widespread formation of neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark pathological features in these disorders. The naturalistic paradigms of these foci in the Western Pacific have provided insights to understanding not only ALS and PD but other neurological disorders, such as classical ALS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and early neuronal ageing. ","Clinical evidence shows that ischemic and hemorrhagic microvascular lesions in the brain play an important role in elderly dementia [1-4], but few effective treatment or preventative strategies exist. This deficit is due, in part, to a lack of good animal models of these microvascular lesions that would allow the progression of disease to be studied and would provide a platform for the evaluation of therapeutics. Here, we discuss recent advances in optical techniques that allow both the targeted production of single-vessel occlusions and hemorrhages in the cortex of anesthetized rodents, as well as the quantitative analysis of the impact of these lesions on blood flow in the adjacent vascular network and on the health and function of nearby brain cells. These new optical tools offer a comprehensive animal model of small-scale stroke that will enable the progression of neural damage after a microvascular insult as well as the interaction of small strokes with other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, to be studied.","###Label:

###Reason:
The term ""dementia"" in both Text A and Text B continues to refer to a decline in cognitive function typically associated with neurological disorders. In Text A, dementia is mentioned in the context of parkinsonism-dementia syndrome, illustrating its appearance in communities suffering from ALS and similar disorders marked by neurofibrillary tangles and other pathologies affecting the brain. The discussion primarily centers around epidemiological and pathological insights into neurological diseases that manifest dementia, alongside other symptoms.

Text B, while more focused on contemporary research methodologies and investigating the microscopic causes of dementia (specifically through microvascular lesions), maintains the usage of the term in the sense of decline or impairment characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Therefore, while advancements in medical research have refined our understanding of the mechanisms and manifestations of dementia, the fundamental context in which ""dementia"" is used—indicative of an overall decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life—remains largely unchanged between the two texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the term ""dementia"" based on the contextual usage seen between these time periods in medical literature."
8,Dementia,"A random controlled trial of the relaxing effects of an aromatherapy massage on disordered behaviour in dementia was conducted. Twenty-one patients were randomly allocated into one of three conditions, aromatherapy and massage (AM), conversation and aromatherapy (CA) and massage only (M). AM showed the greatest reduction in the frequency of excessive motor behaviour of all three conditions. This reached statistical significance between the hours of three and four pm (p < 0.05). Post hoc analysis suggested that at this time of day the AM consistently reduced motor behaviour when compared with CA (p = 0.05). This provides preliminary evidence of a measurable sedative effect of aromatherapy massage on dementia within a robust scientific paradigm. Further research is recommended with an expanded sample size.","Neuroinflammation is emerging as an important pathological process in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but biomarkers are lacking.

- Reason: The usage of the word ""dementia"" has shown a significant semantic drift from Text A to Text B. In Text A (older text), ""dementia"" is discussed mainly in the context of managing symptoms through non-medical interventions like aromatherapy and massage, focusing on the behavioral and symptomatic management of dementia. The term there is associated more with palliative care and symptom relief. Conversely, in Text B (more recent text), the focus is on the biological and molecular aspects of dementia, particularly frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, ""dementia"" is linked closely to neuroinflammatory processes and the search for biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, indicating a movement towards understanding the underlying mechanisms and potential early diagnosis and intervention strategies. This indicates a shift from merely managing symptoms to a deeper understanding and potentially addressing the root causes of dementia through scientific research, reflecting broader changes in the medical field's approach to this condition over time."
9,Dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the third-leading cause of cortical dementia after Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, and is characterized by a dementia where behavioral disturbances are prominent and appear early in the course of the disease. We report the case of a 58 year-old man affected by dementia with behavioral disturbances, in addition to rigid-hypokinetic and a lower motor neuron syndrome that were present at later stages of the illness. Neuroimaging studies showed frontotemporal atrophy. Neuropathological studies revealed intense thalamic neuronal loss and astrocytic gliosis, as well as moderate frontotemporal neuronal loss, astrocytosis and spongiform degeneration. Thalamic degeneration has previously been described among the wide group of neuropathological features of FTD. The aim of the present study is to show the clinical and neuropathological aspects of thalamic degeneration in FTD, along with its role in behavioral disturbances, a common finding in this condition.","The debate on legalization of physician-assisted death (PAD) has focused on its purely individual aspects, leaving aside equally relevant social dimensions such as a progressive expansion of PAD's causes, strains and changes in the doctor-patient relationship, and unreported PADs. The aim of this work was to explore these aspects through an analysis of the experience of Belgium and the Netherlands, countries where PAD is legal since 2002. The results, obtained through a systematic review of the literature, indicate that in both countries, the acceptance of the concept of ""psychological suffering"" allowed PAD to be performed in psychiatric patients, in persons with dementia and in older people with geriatric conditions. The acceptance to perform a PAD has a significant emotional burden for the physician who must assume the role of executor of the patient's will, which is aggravated by pressures from patients and their relatives. Moreover, more than 30% of PADs are not reported.

Text A discusses frontotemporal dementia (FTD) primarily from a clinical and neuropathological perspective, elaborating on its symptoms and associated brain changes. Text B, while addressing a broader societal and ethical context, still mentions dementia within the framework of its medical implications, particularly in discussions on physician-assisted death (PAD) where the cognitive and decisional capacities of patients are crucial. The core concept of ""dementia"" as a medical condition involving cognitive decline therefore remains consistent between the two texts despite the different contexts in which it is discussed."
10,Dementia,"Because of clinical and neuropathological overlap between the characteristics of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and of a human thiamin deficiency syndrome (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) dependent processes have been studied in DAT brain and other tissues. The activities of 3 TPP-dependent enzymes are reduced in DAT brain: transketolase (TK), the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC). Quantitatively, the most marked reductions are in KGDHC (to less than 20% of normal). In cultured skin fibroblasts, KGDHC activity is reduced to 50-60% of normal, TK activity to 80-90% of normal, and PDHC is normal. Structural and molecular studies of the DAT and non-DAT enzymes are in process. A lesion of KGDHC may be related to the pathogenesis of DAT. Treatment with large doses of thiamin has not been beneficial, but the data are not totally negative. Further studies of thiamin-dependent mechanisms in DAT seem justified.",We report the findings of a knowledge synthesis research project on the topic of dementia-friendly acute care (D-FAC) design.

- Reason: In Text A from an earlier period, the focus is on the biochemical and neurological aspects of dementia, particularly dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), exploring the pathological underpinnings and cellular enzyme activity related to the disease. The term ""dementia"" here is closely associated with biological, clinical studies, and the pursuit of treatment through biochemical interventions.

  In contrast, Text B from a more recent period uses the term ""dementia"" in the context of ""dementia-friendly"" environmental design aimed at enhancing the quality of life and safety of individuals living with dementia. This usage indicates a shift towards a more holistic, inclusive approach to dealing with dementia, considering societal and environmental adaptations alongside medical treatments.

  This demonstrates a significant change in the connotation and usage of ""dementia"" from a purely medical or disease-oriented perspective to a broader sociocultural and design-focused perspective, reflecting an evolution in understanding and addressing the needs of individuals with dementia within different spaces in society."
11,Dementia,"The mechanism(s) by which HIV-1 affects neural injury in HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD) remains unknown. To ascertain the role that cellular and viral macrophage products play in HAD neurotoxicity, we explored one potential route for neuronal demise, CXCR4. CXCR4, expressed on lymphocytes and neurons, is both a part of neural development and a co-receptor for HIV-1. Its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), affects neuronal viability. GTP binding protein (G-protein) linked signaling after neuronal exposure to SDF-1alpha, virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) secretory products, and virus was determined. In both human and rat neurons, CXCR4 was expressed at high levels. SDF-1alpha/beta was detected predominantly in astrocytes and at low levels in MDM. SDF-1beta/beta was expressed in HAD brain tissue and upregulated in astrocytes exposed to virus infected and/or immune activated MDM conditioned media (fluids). HIV-1-infected MDM secretions, virus and SDF-1beta induced a G inhibitory (Gi) protein-linked decrease in cyclic AMP (cAMP) and increase inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) and intracellular calcium. Such effects were partially blocked by antibodies to CXCR4 or removal of virus from MDM fluids. Changes in G-protein-coupled signaling correlated, but were not directly linked, to increased neuronal synaptic transmission, Caspase 3 activation and apoptosis. These data, taken together, suggest that CXCR4-mediated signal transduction may be a potential mechanism for neuronal dysfunction during HAD.","Previous studies showed inconsistent results for the correlation between cognitive reserve (CR) and cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, conflicting results were obtained for the association between CR and risk of longitudinal cognitive decline, longitudinal progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and longitudinal progression to dementia in PD patients.","###Label:

###Reason:
In Text A, the term ""dementia"" specifically refers to ""HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD),"" focusing on the pathological impacts of the HIV-1 virus on neural functions and related neuronal symptoms. The context here revolves around the biological mechanisms through which HIV-1 induces neural impairment leading to dementia, with a detailed discussion on molecular interactions contributing to neural damage and neuronal dysfunction during HAD.

In Text B, ""dementia"" is discussed in a broader context, referring to a stage of cognitive decline that can be a progression of diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). Here, dementia is not tied to any specific infection or mechanistic pathway but is considered a possible progression of neurodegenerative disease influenced by factors like cognitive reserve. This shift from a specific infection-related neural degeneration context in Text A to a broader neurodegenerative context in Text B shows significant semantic drift in the conceptual understanding and application of the term ""dementia"" between the two texts."
12,Dementia,Quantitatively analyzed resting electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and P300 event-related potentials elicited with a passive tone sequence paradigm were examined in 30 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 15 age matched controls. Background electrical rhythms of DAT patients evidenced slowing as shown by increased absolute and relative amplitudes in slow frequency bands and decreased amplitudes in fast frequency bands (relative to controls). Electrical slowing was more evident in patients with higher clinical ratings of global intellectual deterioration. Passive P300 amplitude and latency did not differentiate patients and controls and were not related to severity of dementia.,"In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of lycopene (Lyc) on vascular dementia (VaD) gerbils and its related mechanisms of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activity. Gerbils were treated with bilateral common carotid arteries. Animals were divided into 1) Sham, 2) VaD model, and 3) VaD model + Lyc (20 mg/kg) groups. Each group (3) was administered intergalactic Lyc twice a day for 28 days. Morris water mazes were used to evaluate learning and memory ability. Nissl, NeuN, and GFAP staining were used to observe histomorphological changes of neural and glial cells in the hippocampus CA1 region. Western blotting was used to detect hippocampus caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 related × protein (Bax), and interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) expression amongst other inflammatory factors. Secreted IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a levels were assessed by ELISA in addition to superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA). We found that Lyc increased the learning and memory ability of gerbils by reducing the latency time in the Morris water maze, and increasing spatial memory. Lyc also reduced pathological changes in the hippocampus caused by VaD, reduced apoptosis, and decreased VaD mediated Bcl-2/Bax expression. The levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress were also reduced by Lyc in the VaD models. We therefore conclude that Lyc can improve the learning and memory ability of VaD gerbils, the mechanism of which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in VaD hippocampus neurons.","### Answer:

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the word ""dementia"" is utilized in a medical context, primarily focusing on its neurological and cognitive implications. Text A specifically discusses the brain wave patterns and event-related potentials in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (DAT), emphasizing the electrical activities and their correlation with the severity of dementia. Text B delves into the specific type of dementia known as vascular dementia (VaD), exploring therapeutic interventions (like lycopene) and their impacts on the disease's symptoms like memory and neuron health.

Both texts, despite being from potentially different times and discussing differing sub-types and treatments of dementia, fundamentally treat ""dementia"" as a clinical condition associated with cognitive decline and memory impairment. Thus, the core semantic of the word ""dementia"" as a cognitive impairment related to neurological changes remains consistent between the texts."
13,Dementia,"Alcoholism is a possible cause of dementia, mainly through associated nutritional deficiencies and, rarely, through acute direct toxicity. However alcohol consumption was not found to be a risk factor in previous epidemiologic studies. We prospectively studied 3,777 community residents aged 65 and over, in the districts of Gironde and Dordogne. Average daily alcoholic consumption was recorded at baseline. Incident cases of dementia and Alzheimer's disease were screened at follow-up with explicit criteria. At 3 years, 2,273 subjects not demented at baseline were still available for follow-up. Wine was the only alcoholic beverage reported by more than 95 p. 100 of regular drinkers. In the 318 subjects drinking 3 to 4 standard glasses per day (> 250 and up to 500 ml), categorized as moderate drinkers, the crude odds ratio (OR) was 0.18 for incident dementia (p < 0.01) and 0.25 for Alzheimer's disease (p < 0.03), as compared to the 971 non-drinkers. After adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, baseline MMSE and other possible confounders, the ORs were respectively 0.19 (p < 0.01) and 0.28 (p < 0.05). In the 922 mild drinkers (< 1 to 2 glasses per day) there was a negative association only with AD, after adjustment (OR = 0.55; p < 0.05). The inverse relationship between moderate wine drinking and incident dementia was explained neither by known predictors of dementia nor by medical, psychological or socio-familial factors. Considering also the well documented negative associations between moderate wine consumption and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this age group, it seems that there is no medical rationale to advise people over 65 to quit drinking wine moderately, as this habit carries no specific risk and may even be of some benefit for their health. Advising all elderly people to drink wine regularly for prevention of dementia would be however premature at this stage.","Ancillary to decline in cognitive abilities, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) frequently suffer from behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Hypothalamic polypeptides such as melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and hypocretin-1 (HCRT-1, orexin-A) are promoters of sleep-wake regulation and energy homeostasis and are found to impact on cognitive performance. To investigate the role of MCH and HCRT-1 in AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels were measured in 33 patients with AD and 33 healthy subjects (HS) using a fluorescence immunoassay (FIA). A significant main effect of diagnosis (F(1,62) = 8.490, p<0.01) on MCH levels was found between AD (93.76±13.47 pg/mL) and HS (84.65±11.40 pg/mL). MCH correlated with T-tau (r = 0.47; p<0.01) and P-tau (r = 0.404; p<0.05) in the AD but not in the HS. CSF-MCH correlated negatively with MMSE scores in the AD (r = -0.362, p<0.05) and was increased in more severely affected patients (MMSE≤20) compared to HS (p<0.001) and BPSD-positive patients compared to HS (p<0.05). In CSF-HCRT-1, a significant main effect of sex (F(1,31) = 4.400, p<0.05) with elevated levels in females (90.93±17.37 pg/mL vs. 82.73±15.39 pg/mL) was found whereas diagnosis and the sex*diagnosis interaction were not significant. Elevated levels of MCH in patients suffering from AD and correlation with Tau and severity of cognitive impairment point towards an impact of MCH in AD. Gender differences of CSF-HCRT-1 controversially portend a previously reported gender dependence of HCRT-1-regulation. Histochemical and actigraphic explorations are warranted to further elucidate alterations of hypothalamic transmitter regulation in AD.","###Label:

###Reason:
The meaning of the target word ""dementia"" remains consistent across both Text A and Text B. In Text A, dementia is discussed mainly in the context of its relationship to alcohol consumption among elderly individuals and its incidence related to moderate wine drinking. The focus is on epidemiological findings on dementia, its onset, and associated risk factors such as alcohol, making clear references to its relation as a cognitive and neurodegenerative disorder, especially with mentions of Alzheimer's disease as a specific type of dementia.

In Text B, dementia remains closely associated with cognitive decline, specifically within the context of Alzheimer's disease. The text further delves into biochemical research linking hypothesized impacts of certain polypeptides on cognitive functions and the biochemical characteristics of dementia as a disease. Importantly, the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are highlighted which directly ties it to the cognitive and neurological disruptions mentioned in Text A.

Both texts, though focusing on different facets (epidemiological versus biochemical aspects), consistently treat dementia as a cognitive and neurological disorder that affects memory and other functions important for daily living, with the term faithfully retaining its essential meaning across both the texts."
14,Dementia,"To examine the effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 4 on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the clinical course of 33 AD patients (17 cases with ApoE epsilon4 and 16 cases without ApoE epsilon4) was evaluated with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biological markers. The decline of MMSE scores to zero was shortened in the ApoE4 group. During a mean follow-up of 20 months, a significant increase of CSF tau levels was observed in the ApoE4 group. A lower level of CSF A beta1-42(43) was found in both the ApoE4 and non-ApoE4 groups than in age-matched normal controls. The ApoE epsilon4 allele accelerates the progression of dementia and increases the levels of CSF tau in AD patients.","Decreased cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) on [123I]MIBG myocardial scintigraphy has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We hypothesized that cardiac sympathetic denervation might account for the pathomechanism. To elucidate the extent, frequency and pattern of cardiac sympathetic nerve involvement in Lewy body disease and related neurodegenerative disorders, we immunohistochemically examined heart tissues from patients with PD (n=11), DLB (n=7), DLB with Alzheimer's disease (DLB/AD; n=4), multiple system atrophy (MSA; n=8), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=5), pure AD (n=10) and control subjects (n=5) together with sympathetic ganglia from patients with PD (n=5) and control subjects (n=4), using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the hearts had almost entirely disappeared in nearly all the patients with PD, DLB and DLB/AD, whereas they were well preserved in all the patients with PSP and pure AD as well as in all except for one patient with MSA. In PD, neurons in the sympathetic ganglia were preserved in all except for one patient. Decreased cardiac uptake of MIBG in Lewy body disease reflects actual cardiac sympathetic denervation, which precedes the neuronal loss in the sympathetic ganglia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" is used within a medical context to discuss clinical diagnoses related to neurodegenerative diseases. In Text A (focused on Alzheimer's disease), dementia is discussed primarily as a symptom or a progression state in patients with specific genetic markers (ApoE epsilon4 allele). The text explores the accelerated progression of dementia and its correlation with certain biological markers in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid.

Text B addresses the concept of dementia in the context of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The text elaborates on physiological changes, specifically cardiac sympathetic denervation, associated with these diseases and how they relate to dementia.

In both instances, ""dementia"" is used to describe a clinical symptom complex related to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, consistent throughout both periods despite various specific focuses concerning the diseases and diagnostic methods being discussed. Hence, the semantic usage of ""dementia"" remains closely related to its medical and neuroscientific connotations, reflecting no significant semantic drift but rather an expansion in understanding and diagnosing the conditions linked to it."
15,Dementia,"The main causes of dementia at old age are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dementia"" maintains its primary meaning related to a decline in cognitive function typically associated with older age, characterized by memory loss and impaired reasoning or judgment. Text A discusses dementia as largely encompassing Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and implicates both vascular factors and amyloid dispositions in cognitive decline. Text B focuses on the practical aspect of recognizing and addressing dementia, particularly the delay in seeking professional help after symptoms are first noticed.

16,Dementia,"Since 1980, three immunocompromised patients have been proved to have progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) by brain biopsy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Two patients presented with focal neurological findings, and the third presented with dementia. Computed tomography (CT) revealed white matter low density lesions in areas appropriate to the neurological abnormalities. Brain biopsy of areas that were abnormal on CT produced diagnostic tissue in all three patients. No patient suffered ill effects from the biopsy. Neuropathological findings on light microscopy were compatible with PML in each case, although there was diversity within the group. Involvement of gray and white matter was present in all biopsy specimens; oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons were affected. Electron microscopic demonstration of particles compatible with polyoma virus confirmed the diagnosis in each case. Immunosuppressive medication was discontinued in two of the patients; these two have survived more than 2 years after diagnosis. One of these two has gradually improved and is independent in simple activities of daily life. Brain stem and cerebellar involvement and seizure disorders have been present in all reported cases. PML can be accurately and rapidly diagnosed by brain biopsy, enabling therapeutic manipulations that may prolong survival.","An innovative non-pharmacological intervention called Voix d'Or(®) (Golden Voice) was proposed in the Cognitive behavioral unit (CBU) of the Memory center at the Hospices civils in Lyon.

In cases with a moderately severe variant paroxysmal manifestations were presented by an array of temporal and unfolded convulsive forms. Psychotic disorders of the hallucinatory-delirious type serve as signs of a late exacerbation of the epileptic process. An unfavourable variant was characterized by polymorphic attacks with predominance of postural and psychomotor components, frequent states of decompensation, an increase in signs of epileptic dementia and a wide spectrum of psychotic disturbances, ranging from overworship ideas to affective-delirious and catatonic-delirious psychoses.","There has been supporting evidence that older adults with underlying health conditions form the majority of the fatal cases in the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

People with differing degrees of ADRD are especially susceptible to the virus, not only because of their difficulties in assessing the threat or remembering the safety measures, but also because of the likelihood to be subject to other risk factors, such as lack of proper care and psychological issues.

- **Reason:** 
  - In **Text A** (historical context not explicit, possibly older), the term ""dementia"" is used specifically in the context of ""epileptic dementia,"" which refers to cognitive impairments that develop as a consequence of epilepsy. The term is used to describe a condition, akin to a symptom or direct outcome, that is part of a spectrum of epilepsy-associated disorders.

  - In **Text B** (2020 context of the COVID-19 pandemic), ""dementia"" is referenced in the term ""Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD)"". Here, dementia is broadly used to describe a category of conditions characterized by a decline in memory, problem-solving, and other cognitive functions that interfere with daily life. This use suggests a broader, more general understanding of dementia as a standalone set of diseases, mainly age-related and not specifically tied to epilepsy or another single condition.

  - This comparison shows that the term has broadened in scope over time. From a specific symptom of epilepsy (epileptic dementia) to a broader categorization of cognitive decline conditions (ADRD) across various causes, most prominently Alzheimer’s. Thus, the semantic usage of the term ""dementia"" has shifted significantly."
18,Dementia,"Although dementia is typically considered to be a consequence of a variety of neurologic diseases, it can also serve as a risk factor for other adverse outcomes.

It has been suggested that cascading neural network failures may bring on behavioural deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is used in a medical and neurological context, referring specifically to cognitive decline associated with certain diseases (ischemic stroke in Text A and Alzheimer's disease in Text B). Both texts treat dementia as a condition with significant medical consequences and discuss the need for understanding or addressing it within the framework of health outcomes or neurology. Therefore, the core meaning and usage of the term ""dementia"" related to cognitive and behavioral impairments have remained consistent between the texts, indicating no significant semantic drift."
19,Dementia,"The role of the nef gene in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is poorly understood. To provide a basis for studies on the role of nef in AIDS, we used targeted polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing to determine the structure of nef genes in pathologic tissue from HIV-1-infected children and adults. We find that the nef reading frame is open in 92% of clones derived from both brain and lymphocytic tissue of children, suggesting that nef is expressed in these tissues. One HIV-1 clone, BRVA, obtained by coculture from the brain of an adult AIDS patient with progressive dementia, was previously shown to contain a duplicated region in nef. We show here that similar duplications are widespread in both adults and children with AIDS. However, coculture strongly selects against the broad spectrum of nef quasispecies found in tissue. These findings suggest functional selection for nef quasispecies in pathologic tissues during HIV-1 infection of the human host.","Depressive symptoms are frequently seen in patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Evidence suggests that there may be a link between current depressive symptoms and Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated pathological changes, such as an increase in cortical amyloid-β (Aβ). However, limited in vivo studies have explored the relationship between current depressive symptoms and cortical Aβ in patients with MCI and AD. Our study, using a large sample of 455 patients with MCI and 153 patients with AD from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiatives, investigated whether current depressive symptoms are related to cortical Aβ deposition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-depression/dysphoria. Cortical Aβ was quantified using positron emission tomography with the Aβ probe(18)F-florbetapir (AV-45).(18)F-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (AV-45 SUVR) from the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions was estimated. A global AV-45 SUVR, defined as the average of frontal, cingulate, precuneus, and parietal cortex, was also used. We observed that current depressive symptoms were not related to cortical Aβ, after controlling for potential confounds, including history of major depression. We also observed that there was no difference in cortical Aβ between matched participants with high and low depressive symptoms, as well as no difference between matched participants with the presence and absence of depressive symptoms. The association between depression and cortical Aβ deposition does not exist, but the relationship is highly influenced by stressful events in the past, such as previous depressive episodes, and complex interactions of different pathways underlying both depression and dementia.

Although both texts come from different years, the core interpretation of dementia as a cognitive and functional decline remains consistent between them. Text A uses the term within the context of progressive dementia in AIDS patients showing the disease's broad impact on cognitive functions. Text B discusses dementia alongside mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, focusing more on the symptoms and associated pathological markers like cortical Aβ.

20,Dementia,"We studied senile plaques (SP) in the cerebella of six autopsied subjects with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) and ten non-ATD autopsied subjects between the ages of 78 and 90. Neither SP nor amyloid angiopathy (AA) was observed in any of the non-ATD subjects. In the four of the six ATD subjects, diffuse plaques in the molecular layer were seen as ill-defined areas of fine fibrillar materials by beta protein immunostaining with formic acid pretreatment, the modified Bielschowsky stain, and periodic acid-methenamine silver (PAM) stain. The plaques were not visible with Bodian, Congo red, or periodic acid-Schiff stains. Compact plaques in the Purkinje cell or in the granular cell layers were found in three of the six subjects. Their amyloid core was often surrounded by areolar amyloid deposits. AA was observed in three of the six subjects. The argyrophilia of the diffuse and compact plaques, demonstrated by the modified Bielschowsky and PAM stains, became undetectable when the sections were first treated with formic acid. Such treatment made the plaques immunoreactive with beta protein antiserum. The findings suggested that cerebellar diffuse plaques and compact plaques consist mainly of an amyloid component, and are characteristic of ATD.","The frequencies of each of the several types of dementia are enumerated, showing that Alzheimer's disease is present in about 80% of cases. Cerebral changes associated with cognitively normal aging include shrinkage of large cortical neurons but not a significant loss of total neuronal number. Nevertheless, the population density of synapses measured by confocal microscopy does decline significantly in normal aging. The classical lesions of Alzheimer's disease are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and their frequency correlates with declining cognitive measures. Although amyloid is prominent in plaques, it is probably not the agent of destruction. That role seems to be held by Abeta oligomers. The strongest structural correlate with cognitive tests is synapse loss, which is probably caused by Abeta oligopeptides in the terminal axons and dendrites.","###Answer:

- Text A: The passage from earlier time discusses Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) focusing specifically on its neuropathological markers such as senile plaques (SP), amyloid angiopathy (AA), and their detailed characteristics seen through immunostaining and staining methods. The term ""dementia"" here is closely associated with these physical brain changes typical of Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing a narrowly focused pathological perspective.
- Text B: In the more recent text, ""dementia"" still includes Alzheimer's disease but is described within a broader context of different types of dementia, mentioning Alzheimer's as one type among others. This narration also discusses broader cerebral changes associated with aging and more advanced insights into the disease mechanisms, like the role of synapse loss and Abeta oligopeptides, rather than just plaque formation. This represents an enhanced understanding of dementia that not only links to Alzheimer's but also elaborates on the cognitive and synaptic alterations, shifting slightly from a purely pathological focus to more functional and molecular insights.

Psychosocial intervention programmes aimed at reducing the prescription of antipsychotic drugs are available. These programmes may target care home residents (e.g. improving communication and interpersonal relationships) or target staff (e.g. by providing skills for caring for people with BPSD).

Text B broadens the scope to encompass behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and discusses comprehensive management strategies, including psychosocial interventions and antipsychotic medications. Despite the detailed management approaches in Text B, the underlying essence of the term ""dementia"" as a cognitive and behavioral impairment remains steady across both texts.

Low-grade systemic inflammation occurs in clinical conditions such as insulin resistance, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, lupus, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias, cancer and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that are also characterized by an alteration in the metabolism of essential fatty acids in the form of excess production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and possibly, decreased synthesis and release of anti-inflammatory lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. We propose that low-grade systemic inflammation observed in these clinical conditions is due to an imbalance in the metabolism of essential fatty acids that is more in favour of pro-inflammatory molecules. In this context, transgenic fat-1 mouse that is designed to convert n-6 to n-3 fatty acids could form an ideal model to study the altered metabolism of essential fatty acids in the above mentioned conditions. It is envisaged that low-grade systemic inflammatory conditions are much less likely in the fat-1 mouse and/or these diseases will run a relatively mild course. Identifying the anti-inflammatory compounds from n-3 fatty acids that suppress low-grade systemic inflammatory conditions and understanding their mechanism(s) of action may lead to newer therapeutic strategies.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A from an earlier period, the usage of ""dementia"" pertains specifically to a clinical case signifying a neurological disorder characterized primarily by cognitive decline, specifically focusing on symptoms and direct cerebral damages like infarcts shown in imaging studies. It exemplifies dementia as a symptom-related diagnosis tied to distinct cerebral events. Conversely, Text B from a later period portrays ""dementia"" in the broader context of chronic systemic conditions, involving discussions about metabolic imbalances and inflammation contributing to conditions like Alzheimer's and other dementias. This shift from a purely neurological focus to a wider systemic and metabolic perspective indicates a semantic drift towards an understanding of dementia not only as a direct result of localized brain damage but also as a feature of broader biological processes, including inflammatory and metabolic pathways."
23,Dementia,"In the last decade several investigations have demonstrated an association between impaired cerebral function in employed workers and occupational exposure to organic solvents. Many case-histories and two case-referent studies indicate, that such an impairment might develop into disabling irreversible neuropsychiatric disease. The main purpose of this study was to further investigate the risk of chronic brain damage in solvent exposed workers. A cohort of 2601 male painters and 1790 male bricklayers from the Copenhagen area was identified retrospectively and followed Jan. 1,71-Dec. 31,75. For this period the incidence of disability pensioning and mortality was examined for the two occupational groups and for a ""'normal"" population of Copenhagen men. Using bricklayers and Copenhagen men as referents, the painters had a relative risk of approximately 3.5 of being awarded a disability pension due to a state of being awarded a disability pension due to a state of cryptogenic presenile dementia. When indications of alcohol abuse, cerebral concussions or other etiologic factors were present, the relative risk was approximately 2. No excess risk was found for neuropsychiatric diseases other than presenile dementia. Other differences between the groups were found, but they were inconsistent and difficult to interpret. In the light of the findings of this and other studies, it seems likely, that chronic brian damage may result from industrial exposure to organic solvents.","Stroke increases the risk of dementia; however, bidirectional association of incident stroke and cognitive decline below dementia threshold is not well established. Also, both cognitive decline and stroke increase mortality risk.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: Both texts exemplify the use of the word ""dementia"" to describe a neurological condition involving cognitive decline or impaired cerebral function that potentially progresses to a more severe state. Text A discusses dementia as part of chronic brain damage linked to exposure to occupational hazards, specifically in the context of organic solvents affecting workers' cognitive abilities and possibly advancing to cryptogenic presenile dementia. Text B addresses the link between stroke incidents and an elevated risk of developing dementia, highlighting the clinical and biological association between cognitive decline and neurological diseases such as stroke, focusing on the broader context of cognitive impairment escalating toward dementia. The core use of ""dementia"" referring to significant cognitive and memory disorders remains consistent in these varying cases related to neurological health and its deterioration, thus the meaning has stayed unchanged across the time period from Text A to Text B."
24,Dementia,"Event-related potentials, measured eight times in a patient in the early stages of dementia, demonstrated that clinical symptoms, especially loss of motivation, improved coincidentally with a shortening of reaction time, N1 latency, and P3 latency during nicergoline medication among three nootropics prescribed. Such a longitudinal study design was considered to be useful for quantifying and objectively comparing effects of various nootropics noninvasively.","Parkinson's disease (PD) patients commonly experience episodic memory impairments, which are associated with an increased risk of dementia. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) is a well-validated test to investigate episodic memory changes in healthy aging and in neurodegenerative diseases but has not been studied in PD patients.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, ""dementia"" is used to describe a clinical condition characterized by impairments in cognitive functions and memory that are typical for such disorders. Text A discusses the monitoring and improvement in reaction times and related brain latency measures as indicative of symptom progress in dementia due to medication. Text B refers to dementia as an increased risk associated with memory impairments in Parkinson's disease. Although the contexts and the presentations slightly differ, with one focusing on treatment and the other on risk association in a different disease, the underlying semantic meaning of ""dementia"" as a cognitive decline remains consistent across both texts. The fundamental characterization of ""dementia"" as a cognitive disorder hasn't shifted, thus the usage has not experienced significant semantic drift."
25,Dementia,"The development of diagnostic markers for earlier and more reliable diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is essential, particularly because therapeutic medication is available for AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a useful source of diagnostic information. Previously we found the increase of total tau protein in CSF in normal pressure hydrocephalus patients, and others reported the increase also in corticobasal degeneration and frontotemporal dementia. To differentiate the AD from other diseases, further approach was employed and oxidized protein in CSF was investigated. Heat stable fractions of CSF were analyzed on the content of carbonyl residues, which are derivatives of protein oxidization. The result suggests that protein oxidation is highly involved in AD and that this method might be useful to differentiate AD from other neurological disease.","Although literature on postdiagnostic support for people affected by young onset dementia acknowledges financial concerns, this topic has remained underresearched. The aim of this study was to explore the financial impact of a diagnosis of young onset dementia on individuals and families. An online survey, comprising binary yes/no, multiple-response and open-ended questions, was codesigned with people living with young onset dementia. The survey was promoted via networks and online platforms. Data were collected from August to October 2019. Survey respondents across the United Kingdom (n = 55) who had received a diagnosis of young onset dementia were aged between 45 and 64, were at different stages of dementia and had been diagnosed with thirteen different types of dementia. Of the 55 respondents, 71% (n = 39) had received assistance from family members when completing the survey. The main financial impact of a diagnosis of young onset dementia resulted from premature loss of income and reduced and often deferred pension entitlements. In some cases, care-costs became unaffordable. Lack of clarity of processes and procedures around needs assessments, carers' assessments and financial assessments by different organisations resulted in some families having to ask for legal advice and, in some cases, involved lengthy appeal processes. Future research needs to involve Adult Social Care and Third Sector organisations to help codesign and test financial management interventions to support people affected by this progressive health condition.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dementia
- Text A: This text primarily discusses dementia in the context of its differentiation from other neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s (AD) and corticobasal degeneration using diagnostic markers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The primary focus lies in examining biochemical markers (e.g., tau protein, oxidized protein in CSF) for effective diagnosis and differentiation.
- Text B: Here, dementia is discussed concerning the socio-economic and personal impacts of a diagnosis, particularly of young onset dementia. The text explores the financial burdens associated with dementia, including loss of income and pension entitlements, as well as the societal and familial challenges faced by those diagnosed and their caregivers.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The semantic use of the term ""dementia"" has shifted from a purely medical and clinical diagnosis context in Text A, where the focus is on biochemical markers and differentiation from similar diseases, to a broader socio-economic and personal impact context in Text B. In the latter, dementia is treated not only as a medical condition but also as a socio-economic issue affecting quality of life and financial stability. This reflects a broadening in perspective from clinical parameters to encompass social, economic, and personal dimensions of living with dementia. These changes suggest a significant semantic drift in the contextual application and connotations of ""dementia"" from a strictly clinical focus to a multi-dimensional societal issue.

26,Dementia,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin levels were determined by RIA in individuals with central nervous system (CNS) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and in healthy controls. The mean CSF neopterin concentrations were 63.0 nmol/L in 15 patients with acute bacterial meningitis, 54.9 nmol/L in 15 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, 32.5 nmol/L in 10 patients with viral meningitis, 130.9 nmol/L in 8 patients with viral encephalitis, 13.9 nmol/L in 15 patients with asymptomatic HIV infection, 26.0 nmol/L in 11 patients with AIDS without dementia, 65.4 nmol/L in 4 patients with AIDS dementia, and 4.2 nmol/L in 24 healthy controls. Although patients with viral encephalitis had higher mean neopterin levels than any other patient category studied, the CSF neopterin concentrations cannot be used to discriminate between viral and bacterial infections. Analysis of CSF levels of neopterin may be useful as guidance in following clinical course and effect of treatment and can provide information of value in addition to CSF cell count as a measurement of CNS immune stimulation.","With progress in neurosciences, neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques, mental illnesses are now being seen as development anomalies at the molecular-structural level of synapses, resulting in abnormal cross wiring in areas responsible for complex cognitive and emotional processing. These include the multimodal association cortices situated in the prefrontal lobes, the insula in the temporal lobes, midline cortical structures, and their connections to the thalamus, amygdala and the basal ganglia. Three key networks have been identified which are considered the brain hubs for complex perceptual, emotional and behavior processing as well as introspection, theory of mind and self-awareness; namely the salience network (SN), the central executive network (CEN) and the default mode network (DMN). They function in an interconnected manner and involve in higher information processing of the entire internal and external milieu of the organism to determine the behavior strategies to be adopted. A triple network model of aberrant saliency mapping and cognitive dysfunction in psychopathology has been put forward recently and an attempt is being made to understand core cognitive networks and their dysfunction across multiple disorders including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism and dementia. Against this background, the author would like to take the triple network dysfunction model a step further to hypothesize the following. 1. All or some of the three core networks (CEN, SN & DMN) are affected variably in psychiatric disorders, the severity and the nature of the clinical symptoms depending upon the degree of damage and the number of networks that are dysfunctional and whether that dysfunction is reversible or permanent. For example, in a condition like schizophrenia, all three networks would more or less be affected giving rise to plethora of symptoms like executive deficits, negative symptoms, abnormal salience and mood states. In milder conditions like anxiety and depressive disorders, on the other hand, the dysfunction is of a lesser degree and reversible. 2. These networks are the final common pathway through which a variety of internal or environment insults to the brains may act, the degree of damage and reversibility being determined by the critical period of brain development in which these occur. 3. The harmonious functioning of these core networks is what gives rise to the complex phenomenon of the mind in the brain.","### Label: Changed

### Reason:
In Text A, the term ""dementia"" is primarily used in a clinical, diagnostic manner specifically focusing on ""AIDS dementia"" as a condition linked to AIDS, emphasizing its presence as a part of the classification of different neurological conditions affected by AIDS. The usage is more constricted to an observational, pathology-related context where it's merely listed as one of the symptoms or conditions related to AIDS, signifying a limited understanding or description thereof.

Contrastingly, Text B expands the concept of ""dementia"" into a broader, more complex systemic framework. It is contextualized within advanced neuroscience concepts, including network models like the salience network (SN), central executive network (CEN), and default mode network (DMN) which are thought to play significant roles in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, including dementia. The term is used not just in the classical sense of a standalone disease but as part of intricate brain network dysfunctions that intersect with various other cognitive and emotional processes, illustrating a more integrated and systemic understanding.

This shift from a straightforward disease entity to a component of broader cognitive network dysfunction reflects a significant semantic evolution of the term ""dementia"", indicating a change in the perception and understanding of the disease within the medical and scientific communities. It shows a progression from viewing it as primarily a symptom or specific condition to a complex interplay in broader systemic dysfunctions of the brain, potentially altering both diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies."
27,Dementia,"A 57-year-old woman developed dementia and peripheral neuropathy 16 years after a partial gastrectomy (Billroth II). Serum cobalamin was 198 pmol/l (reference interval 150-550), and the vitamin B12 absorption test (Schilling) showed decreased absorption (1.7% without and 2.2% with intrinsic factor). In spite of 20 months' therapy with vitamin B12, the neurological symptoms progressed. Folate deficiency was suggested by a very low erythrocyte folate and a slightly abnormal FIGLU test. There were no other signs of general malabsorption. A few months' treatment with folic acid significantly improved the massive neurological manifestations which were verified neurophysiologically as well as histologically. A common role of vitamin B12 and folate in the development of neuropathy is suggested.","The elderly population of ethnic minorities is increasing in most Western countries, but ethnic minority patients are underrepresented in dementia assessment and care. This may in part be due to cultural perceptions of dementia and lack of knowledge about the available support among ethnic minorities. Also, it can be difficult to make clinical assessments of ethnic minority patients who do see a physician for dementia symptoms. In particular, the interpretation of cognitive test results represents a major challenge.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dementia"" is used in a medical context specifically related to a neurological diagnosis following a physical condition (i.e., vitamin deficiencies post-gastrectomy) and connected to the progression of the disease in terms of physiological manifestations and treatment outcomes. In Text B, ""dementia"" refers to the broader social and cultural implications of the diagnosis, focusing on the societal challenges, disparities in healthcare, and multicultural aspects affecting the assessment and care of dementia in ethnic minority populations. Hence, the word has experienced a semantic drift from a purely medical or biological perspective to include broader socio-cultural and healthcare system-related connotations."
28,Dementia,"Insomnia in elderly people has traditionally been regarded as inevitable and trivial. A longitudinal study was undertaken to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbance among elderly people in an inner London community and its association with demographic variables, depression, dementia and disability. Those aged 65 years and over living at home were interviewed using a validated and reliable semi-structured interview schedule. A total of 705 people were interviewed in 1987-88 and 524 were re-interviewed in 1990. Subjective sleep disturbance was found to be common (33% and 43%, respectively). Sleep disturbance was associated with being a woman, being unmarried, living alone, disability, and current and future depression, but not with dementia or older age. The best predictor of future depression in elderly people who were not depressed was current sleep disturbance. In the presence of current sleep disturbance, the traditional predictors of depression--being a woman, having a disability, being unmarried, living alone and being older--did not contribute further. This study has shown that sleep disorder is associated with pathology. Insomnia in elderly people requires assessment and this must be accompanied by the treatment of underlying disorders and monitoring of future health.","Two-thirds of people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) live in low- and middle-income countries, and this figure is expected to rise as these populations are rapidly aging. Since evidence demonstrates links between socioeconomic status and slower rates of cognitive decline, protecting older adults' cognitive function in resource-limited countries that lack the infrastructure to cope with ADRD is crucial to reduce the burden it places on these populations and their health systems. While cash transfers are a promising intervention to promote healthy cognitive aging, factors such as household wealth and level of education often confound the ability to make causal inferences on the impact of cash transfers and cognitive function. This study uses a quasi-experimental design, leveraging an exogenous expansion to the Old Age Pension for men in South Africa, to approximate causal associations with cognitive function. We found evidence that there is a potential benefit of cash transfers at an earlier age for older individuals. As such, transfers such as pensions or other forms of direct basic income transfers may hold promise as potential interventions to promote healthy cognitive aging.","###Answer:
- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**: In both texts, the term ""dementia"" refers to a decline in cognitive function associated with aging or disease. Text A focuses on its prevalence among elderly people in an urban community and examines factors related to sleep disturbances, explicitly stating that dementia was not correlated with sleep disturbance. Text B discusses dementia primarily in the context of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and investigates socioeconomic factors that influence cognitive decline in elderly populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Both texts maintain a consistent use of ""dementia"" as a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life, primarily due to neurological or similar organic causes. Despite different aspects and factors associated with dementia being discussed, the core meaning of the term remains the same across both periods."
29,Dementia,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes five distinct neurological syndromes in patients with AIDS: retinitis, myelitis/polyradiculopathy, encephalitis with dementia, ventriculoencephalitis, and mononeuritis multiplex. The clinical syndromes associated with CMV ventriculoencephalitis and diffuse encephalitis in patients with AIDS have only recently been clearly described despite the fact that multiple neuropathologic descriptions of CMV in the brain have been published over the past decade. Even more-subtle levels of cognitive impairment have been detected in patients with CMV retinitis who are also at increased risk of developing diffuse CMV encephalitis. Demonstration of CMV DNA in the CSF with use of the polymerase chain reaction may provide both a sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of these syndromes. The effectiveness of aggressive early treatment of CMV syndromes in the nervous system, with the exception of retinitis, is unclear and warrants formal trials.","Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition often co-exist in (prodromal) dementia, and both types of pathology have been associated with neurodegeneration. We examined whether cSVD and Aβ have independent or interactive effects on hippocampal volume (HV) in a memory clinic population. We included 87 individuals with clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 26), and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) (n = 37). cSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, lacunar infarct presence, and microbleed presence. Aβ pathology was assessed as cerebrospinal fluid-derived Aβ1 - 42 levels and dichotomized into normal or abnormal, and HV was determined by manual volumetric measurements. A linear hierarchical regression approach was applied for the detection of additive or interaction effects between cSVD and Aβ on HV in the total participant group (n = 87) and in the non-demented group (including SCC and MCI individuals only, n = 63). The results revealed that abnormal Aβ and lacunar infarct presence were independently associated with lower HV in the non-demented individuals. Interestingly, Aβ and WMH pathology interacted in the non-demented individuals, such that WMH had a negative effect on HV in individuals with abnormal CSF Aβ42 levels, but not in individuals with normal CSF Aβ42 levels. These associations were not present when individuals with AD were included in the analyses. Our observations suggest that relatively early on in the disease process older individuals with abnormal Aβ levels are at an increased risk of accelerated disease progression when concomitant cSVD is present.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" refers to a neurological syndrome marked by significant cognitive decline and impairment. Text A describes dementia as one of the neurological syndromes caused by CMV in AIDS patients, specifically relating to an encephalitis condition. Text B discusses the interplay of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in dementia patients, emphasizing a clinical context where dementia is associated with memory and cognitive impairments, linking it to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Although the focus, underlying causes, and detailed mechanisms related to dementia are explored differently in both texts, the essential meaning of the word as referring to a decline in cognitive function remains consistent across the two time periods."
30,Dementia,"The utility of the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) when administered to individuals with mental retardation (MR) was examined. Our sample was comprised of individuals residing in an intermediate care facility in the southeastern United States, included individuals diagnosed with mild, moderate, or severe MR, and consisted of both Caucasians (50%) and individuals of African-American descent (50%). Descriptive statistics for the DRS Total Score and five subtests (e. g., Attention, Initiation/Perseveration, Construction, Conceptualization, and Memory) obtained from our sample of individuals with mild MR compared favorably with previously published values. The group with mild MR performed significantly better than the group with moderate MR on the Total Score and all subtests except Construction, and the group with moderate MR performed significantly better than individuals with severe MR on all measures. These results show that the DRS can provide information about the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of individuals with mental retardation, and they show that the DRS can be administered to a wide range of individuals diagnosed with MR.","Dementia is an impairment of mental ability representing a decline from that level previously reached by the individual. It is usually of insidious onset, associated with neurologic changes, and results in the inability to appropriately interact with one's environment. Dementias may be static, progressive, or reversible, and have many etiologies. One percent of the population above age 40 suffers from dementia and this figure rises to 7% above age 80 and 50% above age 90. Forty-five percent of dementias are due to Alzheimer disease (AD) followed closely by vascular dementia. A stage along the way to dementia is mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There are various definitions but the simplest ones refer to a person who has some memory problems but can continue to live independently. A more specific description refers to deficits in two or more areas of cognition >1.5 SD below mean for the individuals age and education. Although previously considered a part of normal aging, a recent study has shown MCI to be a precursor of Alzheimer disease (1). In a cohort of nuns and priests studied annually until they developed MCI or dementia and died. 180 brains in this study have already been autopsied (37 MCI, 60 with no impairment, 53 with dementia). Pathologists measured theamount of AD pathology and cerebral infarcts. Of 37 with MCI, more than half had AD by pathology, 1/3 had infarcts (5 with both) and 14 did not have either pathology. One third of the 180 with average age of 85 had no cognitive decline!

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dementia"" is used to describe a condition related to cognitive decline and impairment, although the context and details provided are different. Text A focuses on assessing dementia within the context of mental retardation using a specific scale (Dementia Rating Scale) to evaluate cognitive functioning in individuals with varying degrees of mental impairment. Text B discusses the broader concept of dementia as a mental impairment associated with neurological changes, mentioning statistical prevalence, its types, and its connection to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these contextual differences, the fundamental meaning of ""dementia"" as a significant decline in cognitive ability that impacts an individual's interaction with their surroundings remains consistent across both texts. Thus, the core meaning of the term ""dementia"" remains unchanged between the two texts."
31,Dementia,"An auditory discrimination paradigm was employed to elicit event-related brain potentials in 13 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 14 patients with multi-infarct dementia. The P300 latency was significantly prolonged in 12 patients with dementia compared with age-matched controls and showed a significant negative correlation with the score of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), especially with that of Digit Span subtest. There was no disease specificity. After physostigmine treatment, P300 latency decreased and WAIS score increased in 6 among 10 cases.","We investigated changes of the scaling exponent alpha estimated by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of electroencephalograms (EEG) in patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease(AD), and attempted to apply a method of pattern recognition using the alpha value-based feature vector to classify dementia. In 9 patients with AD, 8 patients with other types of dementia (vD), and 7 patients without dementia(C), DFA was performed for approximately one minute with background EEG data recorded at 16 different scalp monopoles. The alpha values were significantly higher in patients with AD at electrodes F7, C3, P3, P4, T3, and T5 than in patients without dementia. No significant difference in alpha values was found between patients with vD and without dementia. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained on the alpha value-based feature vector of EEG to classify patients with dementia into AD and vD. The trained ANN successfully diagnosed all four new test cases of AD. From these observations, it is suggested that AD has a specific pattern in the alpha value-based feature vector. Thus, pattern recognition using alpha value-based feature vector may be useful for the classification of dementia.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the use of the term ""dementia"" remains focused on its original meaning relating to a cluster of cognitive and psychological symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning, commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease and other kinds of degenerative neurological conditions. In Text A, ""dementia"" is directly used to refer to neurocognitive impairments as measured by cognitive testing (e.g., WAIS) in patients suffering from Alzheimer's and multi-infarct dementia. Similarly, in Text B, ""dementia"" is employed within a clinical research context to explore neurophysiological markers (EEG scaling parameters) for differentiating types of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. Both examples showcase the term within a medical and diagnostic framework, consistently referring to the syndrome's neurocognitive deterioration. Thus, the meaning of ""dementia"" has not undergone significant semantic drift and is still used in a similar context as a medical term referring to related neurocognitive decline."
32,Dementia,"An autopsy case of familial juvenile Alzheimer's disease with extensive involvement of the subcortical gray and white matters is reported. A 33-year-old woman showed a progressive dementia and died of cardiac failure at the age of 45. Neurological examination disclosed choreatic movements, myoclonus, rigidity, and generalized convulsion. Gross inspection of the brain showed a diffuse cerebral atrophy and marked degenerations of both the subcortical gray and white matters. Microscopically, numerous and extensive argyrophilic changes such as senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and granulovacuolar degenerations were observed in the brain. The present case was characterized by a severe neuronal loss in the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, and thalamus as well as a marked myelin loss and axonal damage in the cerebral white matter. This case suggested a combination of multisystemic degeneration and primary degeneration of the cerebral white matter. The pathological similarity of this case to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Pick's disease is discussed.","Disruptions in circadian rhythms can occur in healthy aging; however, these changes are more severe and pervasive in individuals with age-related and neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. Circadian rhythm alterations are also present in preclinical stages of dementia, for example, in patients with mild cognitive impairments (MCI); thus, providing a unique window of opportunity for early intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies examining the association between relevant changes in circadian rhythms and their relationship with cognitive dysfunctions in MCI individuals. In this review, circadian system alterations occurring in MCI patients are examined compared to healthy aging individuals while also considering their association with MCI neurocognitive alterations. The main findings are that abnormal circadian changes in rest-activity, core body temperature, melatonin, and cortisol rhythms appear in the MCI stage and that these circadian rhythm disruptions are associated with some of the neurocognitive deficits observed in MCI patients. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that interventions aimed at restoring regular circadian rhythms may prevent or halt the progress of neurodegenerative diseases and mitigate their related cognitive impairments. Future longitudinal studies with repeated follow-up assessments are needed to establish the translational potential of these findings in clinical practice.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dementia"" is used in the context of neurodegenerative conditions that primarily affect cognitive functions and brain structures. In Text A, it is specifically related to familial juvenile Alzheimer's disease and detailed pathological changes like cerebral atrophy and severe neuronal loss in specific brain areas. The description highlights the progressive cognitive decrease leading to dementia as a symptom of underlying neurological conditions. In Text B, dementia is discussed in the context of circadian rhythm disruptions in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and other factors that may exacerbate or signal the onset of dementia, such as mild cognitive impairments (MCI). The main axis in both texts is the neurodegenerative aspect and the marked degradation in cognitive functions associated with dementia.

Thus, the core meaning and medical context of the word ""dementia"" have remained relatively unchanged between the time periods and contexts provided, maintaining its semantic essence as a term for a syndrome characterized by deterioration in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from normal aging, particularly associated with various diseases and conditions that affect the brain."
33,Dementia,"In an international study, psychometric properties of the Care Dependency Scale (CDS) were examined by analysing data gathered in Dutch, Canadian, Italian and Norwegian nursing homes. For that purpose, from these countries a convenience sample was developed consisting of 525 patients with dementia. The English, Italian and Norwegian research instruments were translations of the original Dutch CDS. Psychometric evaluations of the CDS were carried out for each country separately as well as for the four countries combined. High alpha coefficients between 0.94 and 0.97 were calculated. Subsequent test-retest and inter-rater reliability revealed moderate to substantial Kappa values. Factor analysis resulted in a one-factor solution. The scalability of the CDS was demonstrated by means of Mokken scale analysis. One of the main outcomes of the cross-cultural comparison was that the findings in the four countries show more similarities than differences, so that the scale can be used appropriately in nursing home practice.","The misfolding of host-encoded proteins into pathological prion conformations is a defining characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia. A current area of intense study is the way in which the pathological deposition of these proteins might influence each other, as various combinations of co-pathology between prion-capable proteins are associated with exacerbation of disease.

34,Dementia,"We reclassified the pathological subtypes of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), based on both Lewy pathology and Alzheimer pathology, to clarify the pathological entity of DLB and the boundary between DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in autopsied cases, using both pathological and immunohistochemical methods. DLB was classified as either limbic type or neocortical type according to the degree of Lewy pathology including Lewy bodies (LB) and LB-related neurites by our staging, and was classified as pure form, common form or AD form according to the degree of Alzheimer pathology including neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid deposits by Braak staging. These combined subtypes were lined up on a spectrum, not only with Lewy pathology but also with other DLB-related pathologies including Alzheimer pathology, neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, spongiform change in the transentorhinal cortex and LB-related neurites in the CA2-3 region. In contrast, the Lewy pathology of AD did not meet the stages of Lewy pathology in DLB, and there were scarcely any similarities in other DLB-related pathologies between AD and DLB. In addition, the Lewy pathology of AD had characteristics different from that of DLB, including the coexistence rate of LB with NFT, and the immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic findings of LB and LB-related neurites. These findings suggest that DLB is a distinctive pathological entity that can be differentiated from AD, although it shows some pathological subtypes.",We examined racial and ethnic differences in medication use for a representative US population of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).,"- Label: Unchanged

Text B, while less detailed about the specific pathology, still clearly categorizes ""dementia"" under Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in a context of medication use across different races and ethnicities. Both texts use ""dementia"" in a medical and disease-related context, maintaining the primary definition centered around a category of diseases primarily affecting memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday activities. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift in the use of the term ""dementia"" between the two texts."

- Reason: The target word ""dementia"" is consistently used in both Text A and Text B to refer to a clinical condition characterized by cognitive decline beyond what might be expected from normal aging. In Text A, ""vascular dementia"" specifically refers to a subtype of dementia linked to problems with the supply of blood to the brain, impacting cognitive abilities. In Text B, the focus is on analyzing how blood pressure influences the incidence of dementia in general, indicating ongoing research into the factors that affect or could potentially mitigate the risk of developing dementia.

36,Dementia,"The pathological basis for the dementia which occurs in 20 to 40% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) remains uncertain. In the present postmortem study, we compared the prevalence and severity of parenchymal and vascular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the cerebral cortex in a group of 57 PD brains, including 13 cases with dementia, and in 100 control brains. A higher proportion of PD brains had vascular Abeta deposition, whereas the proportions and severity of parenchymal Abeta were similar in the PD and control groups. There was a poor correlation between Abeta deposition and neurofibrillary tangles which were present in only small numbers in a minority of cases. Cortical Abeta deposition was present in only 6 of the 13 cases with dementia and only 3 fulfilled the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria for definite Alzheimer's disease. The present findings confirm that dementia in PD is only infrequently due to fully established Alzheimer's disease. However, vascular and parenchymal Abeta deposition could still contribute to dementia and cognitive decline when combined with other changes such as alpha-synuclein deposition in the cerebral cortex and cortical Lewy bodies.","Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been proposed as a risk factor for future cognitive decline and dementia. Given the heterogeneity of SCD and the lack of consensus about how to classify this condition, different operationalization approaches still need to be compared. In this study, we used the same sample of individuals to compare  different SCD operationalization approaches. We included 399 cognitively healthy individuals from a community-based cohort. SCD was assessed through nine questions about memory and non-memory subjective complaints. We applied four approaches to operationalize SCD: two hypothesis-driven approaches and two data-driven approaches. We characterized the resulting groups from each operationalization approach using multivariate methods on comprehensive demographic, clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data. We identified two main phenotypes: an amnestic phenotype characterized by an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) signature pattern of brain atrophy; and an anomic phenotype, which was mainly related to cerebrovascular pathology. Furthermore, language complaints other than naming helped to identify a subgroup with subclinical cognitive impairment and difficulties in activities of daily living. This subgroup also showed an AD signature pattern of atrophy. The identification of SCD phenotypes, characterized by different syndromic and biomarker profiles, varies depending on the operationalization approach used. In this study we discuss how these findings may be used in clinical practice and research.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is primarily used to refer to a clinical syndrome characterized by a decline in memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday activities. Despite the advances in understanding and classification, the core meaning of dementia relating to cognitive decline and impairment remains consistent between the two texts.

In Text A from an earlier period, the discussion focuses on the pathological basis and conditions contributing to dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, particularly concerning amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, primarily addressing dementia as a result of neurodegenerative changes.

In Text B from a later period, the term is used in the context of “subjective cognitive decline (SCD)” as a precursor or risk factor for dementia. The study assesses different operationalization approaches to characterize early cognitive complaints that may lead to dementia. This modern text extends the context to include early markers and risk factors but still centralizes on the decline in cognitive abilities as the primary definition of dementia.

Thus, while the understanding and details of the precursors and pathological contributors to dementia have evolved, the primary meaning related to cognitive impairment has not fundamentally changed between the periods reflected in the two texts. Hence, the term ""dementia"" remains conceptually unchanged in its core clinical significance across these texts."
37,Dementia,"Celiac disease (CD/ Nontropicalsprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is a malabsortive condition in which an allergic reaction to the cereal grain-protein gluten (present in wheat, rye and barley) causes small intestine mucosal injury. The onset is in the first four decades of life, with a female to male ratio of 2:1. It may be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including cerebellar ataxia, epileptic seizures, dementia, neuropathy, myopathy and multifocal leucoencephalopathy. We report three patients with neurological manifestations related with CD: one with cerebellar ataxia, one with epilepsy and one with cognitive impairment. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by serologic tests (antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies) and biopsy of the small intestine. In two patients the neurological symptoms preceded the gastrointestinal abnormalities and in all of them gluten restriction failed to improve the neurological disability.","The diagnosis of dementia and the management of its associated symptoms are aided by high-quality assessment tools. However, there is disagreement on the optimal tools among abundant alternatives and lack of consistent quality standards across the different domains of dementia-related change (ie, cognition, severity, function, behavioral and psychological symptoms, delirium, quality of life). Standardization is difficult because the relevance of a measurement tool for health professionals may depend on the clinical setting and on the dementia type and severity. To address this need, we conducted a comprehensive and clinically relevant evidence-based review of dementia-related tools and present a set of recommended tools, the Dementia Outcomes Measurement Suite. The review revealed that considerable development has occurred in terms of assessment of persons with mild cognitive impairment, executive dysfunction, cognitively mediated functional change, and apathy. More research is needed to develop and validate tools to assess health-related quality of life and specific symptoms of dementia including anxiety, wandering, and repetitive vocalizations. This extensive overview of the quality of different measures may serve as a guide for health professionals clinically and for researchers developing new or improved dementia assessment tools.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the word ""dementia"" is used to describe a medical condition characterized by cognitive impairment. Text A discusses dementia as one of the neurological manifestations that can be associated with Celiac disease, focusing on general cognitive decline related to gluten intolerance. Text B discusses the tools and standards necessary for diagnosing and managing dementia, emphasizing its clinical assessment and symptom management. Despite the different contexts – one linking it to a specific disease and the other more focused on its broader clinical management – the underlying concept of dementia as a cognitive impairment condition remains consistent between the texts.

38,Dementia,"Psychiatric disorders are common in the elderly. Antidepressants are probably underprescribed. In recurrent depression, lifelong prophylaxis may be required. Benzodiazepines can aggravate cognitive impairment and cause falls; they should not be used for chronic insomnia.

Thematic analysis revealed the features and facilitators of the bereavement process for spousal caregivers to persons with dementia. The unique contribution of this study to the dementia literature is the finding that the overall process of reclaiming self is significant to the bereavement journey. Future work should investigate identity as understood by spousal caregivers to persons with dementia, and further explore the processes, facilitators, and barriers to healthy bereavement in this population.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the word ""dementia"" refers specifically to a medical or neurological condition that primarily involves cognitive impairment, often in the elderly, and the text focuses on the lack of effective drugs to treat it. The text primarily emphasizes the clinical aspect and the management or treatment challenges associated with dementia.

  In Text B, while the medical aspect of dementia is still relevant, the use of the word ""dementia"" extends into the emotional and social impacts, specifically on spousal caregivers. The focus is more on the experiential and bereavement aspects associated with living and caring for someone with dementia, rather than just the clinical symptoms and treatment. This shows a broadening of the term's usage to include the psychosocial implications and the broader impact on families and caretakers, portraying a shift from a strictly medical perspective to a more holistic view of how dementia affects lives beyond just the patient. This indicates a significant shift in context and connotation over time."
39,Dementia,"HIV-1 enters the brain at the early stage of infection and resides primarily in a limited number of macrophages/microglia and astrocytes. Infection of these cells, however, may not explain the massive neuronal pathology which is seen in AIDS-associated dementia, suggesting a role for factors released from HIV-1 infected cells that trigger a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration. Our results indicate that Tat, the potent regulatory protein of HIV-1 which is secreted by infected cells and can affect neighboring uninfected cells by transcellular means, can influence multiple biological events that lead to neuronal injury. These findings demonstrate that treatment of neuronal cells with Tat affects MAPK/ERK1/2 activity, the downstream central component of the nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data indicate that treatment of cells with Tat severely decreases expression of p35, a neuron-specific activator of cdk5, a cyclin dependent kinase that phosphorylates several neuronal proteins including neurofilament, and plays an important role in neuronal differentiation and survival. In parallel, Tat can bind to the cellular protein, Puralpha, which associates with cdk5. Further, results from Puralpha knockout animals revealed a decrease in p35 activity, pointing to the importance of Puralpha association with cdk5 in the activity of cdk5:p35 complex. These data demonstrate the cooperativity between HIV-1 Tat and the Puralpha in deregulation of the NGF signal transduction pathway in neuronal cells.","The main aims of the study were the translation and the subsequent validation in Italian of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), and the evaluation of its usefulness in discriminating cognitively normal subjects from patients with mild dementia in an elderly population.","## Answer:

Opposite changes in the level of amyloid-β(1-42) versus total tau and phosphorylated-tau181 in the CSF reflect the specific pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the brain. This panel of biomarkers has proven to be effective to differentiate AD from controls and from the major types of neurodegenerative dementia, and to evaluate the progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. In the absence of specific biomarkers reflecting the pathologies of the other most common forms of dementia, such as Lewy Body disease, Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc., the evaluation of biomarkers of AD pathology is used, attempting to exclude rather than to confirm AD. Other biomarkers included in the common clinical practice do not clearly relate to the underlying pathology: progranulin (PGRN) is a selective marker of frontotemporal dementia with mutations in the PGRN gene; the 14-3-3 protein is a highly sensitive and specific marker for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but has to be used carefully in differentiating rapid progressive dementia; and α-synuclein is an emerging candidate biomarker of the different forms of synucleinopathy. This review summarizes several biomarkers of neurodegenerative dementia validated based on the neuropathological processes occurring in brain tissue. Notwithstanding the paucity of pathologically validated biomarkers and their high analytical variability, the combinations of these biomarkers may well represent a key and more precise analytical and diagnostic tool in the complex plethora of degenerative dementia.","### Answer:

Text A discusses a pharmacological approach towards treating dementia using synthesized metabolites of a drug. Text B elaborates on the diagnostic aspects of dementia, focusing on different biomarkers and their role in identifying and differentiating types of neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia. Both texts, despite being focused on different aspects (treatment vs. diagnosis), treat ""dementia"" as a broad category of cognitive degenerative conditions, and the underlying meaning of the term remains consistent with medical descriptions of neurodegenerative disorders affecting cognitive functions. Hence the semantic meaning of ""dementia"" appears unchanged between the periods covered by the two texts."
41,Dementia,"We report here an early autopsy case of a 60-year-old woman clinically diagnosed as having frontal lobe dementia without other neurological deficits. Postmortem examination revealed mild spongiosis in layers II and III of the frontal cortex, together with depletion of melanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. In addition to ubiquitin-positive neurites, ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions, which were previously considered to be a hallmark for motor neuron disease with or without dementia, were identified in neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and of the temporal cortex. Although the patient lacked lower motor symptoms, the presence of Bunina bodies identified in the hypoglossal nuclei further supported the relationship of this case to motor neuron disease. Bunina bodies might be present in some cases of frontal lobe dementia. The presence or absence of Bunina bodies should be scrutinized even in cases without motor symptoms. In this case, creatine kinase of skeletal muscle origin was elevated, which might also be a potential indicator that suggests subclinical involvement of lower motor neurons.","To assess baseline imbalances in placebo-controlled trials of atypical antipsychotics in dementia, and their association with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and mortality.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dementia"" is primarily associated with neuropathological findings like ""frontal lobe dementia"" characterized by specific brain changes, and an autopsy is discussed in relation to unusual findings in a dementia patient. This implies a clinical and physiological discussion mainly focusing on the observable neurological impairments and characteristics of the disease. Conversely, Text B discusses ""dementia"" in a broader context of clinical trials for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, using atypical antipsychotics. Here, ""dementia"" is connected more to its management and the impact of medications on various symptoms like neuropsychiatric symptoms and extrapyramidal symptoms, as well as mortality rates. This shift in focus from purely neurological descriptions to treatment and symptomatic management shows a significant semantic drift in the word's usage from descriptive pathology to a more holistic approach towards patient management and clinical outcomes."
42,Dementia,"To elucidate whether the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE4) affects cortical neuropathology in Parkinson's disease (PD), we determined APOE genotypes and quantified the densities of cortical Lewy bodies (LBs), amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in 22 autopsy-proven PD cases (12 with dementia; 10 without dementia) that were not accompanied by Alzheimer's disease. The APOE4 frequency in the demented patient group was 0.21, which was significantly higher than that in Japanese controls (P < 0.04). LB densities in demented PD patients were significantly higher than those in non-demented PD patients, despite the shorter disease duration in the former. Moreover, plaque density in the temporal cortex and LB density in the cingulate cortex were significantly higher in the group with APOE4 than in that without the allele. There was no difference in tangle density between these two groups. These results suggest that APOE4 may influence the increase in the number of cortical LBs and amyloid plaques in PD. It is possible that when PD occurs in individuals with APOE4, concomitantly evolving cortical LB pathology in a proportion of cases results in limbic (transitional) or neocortical-type LB disease.",There is currently no meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of Yokukansan in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.,"Label: Unchanged

In Text B, the word ""dementia"" is discussed considering the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with it using Yokukansan, which shows the ongoing concern about managing the psychiatric and cognitive symptoms intrinsic to dementia.

43,Dementia,"Alzheimer's dementia is a severe form of dementia characterised by three neuropathological changes: amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration. Several laboratories are involved in studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying development of Alzheimer's disease. As a result of recent research, the main component of amyloid plaques, the beta A4-peptide, is focused upon in hypotheses of the pathogenesis of the disease. The beta A4-peptide is produced by cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). During normal processing of APP, production of beta A4 is hindered and the peptide is therefore presumably a result of alternative cleavage mechanisms. Several factors may increase alternative processing of APP. One possibility is that conformational changes in APP, e.g. induced by mutations in the APP gene, may facilitate alternative cleavage of APP and thereby production of beta A4. This seems to be the case in certain families with familial Alzheimer's disease. Another possibility for increased beta A4 production is excessive expression of APP. This seems to be the case in persons with trisomy 21 who all have neuropathological signs of Alzheimer's disease after the age of 40 years. The gene for APP is localised to the human chromosome 21 and these persons have 1.5 times the normal expression of APP. Furthermore, excessive APP-expression may be induced by an acute phase response in the brain. In vitro studies and neuropathological examinations indicate that alpha 2-macroglobulin in neurons may be induced by cytokines. The protease inhibitor activity of this protein may prevent normal cleavage of APP, thereby resulting in increased alternative cleavage and deposition of beta A4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of disease-related misfolded proteins. It is now widely understood that the characteristic self-amplifying (i.e., seeding) capacity once only attributed to the prions of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases is a feature of other misfolded proteins of neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, Aβ, and αSynuclein (αSyn). Ultrasensitive diagnostic assays, known as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays, exploit these seeding capabilities in order to exponentially amplify protein seeds from various biospecimens. To date, RT-QuIC assays have been developed for the detection of protein seeds related to known prion diseases of mammals, the αSyn aggregates of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, and the tau aggregates of Alzheimer's disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other tauopathies including progressive supranuclear palsy. Application of these assays to premortem human biospecimens shows promise for diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and is an area of active investigation. RT-QuIC assays are also powerful experimental tools that can be used to dissect seeding networks within and between tissues and to evaluate how protein seed distribution and quantity correlate to disease-related outcomes in a host. As well, RT-QuIC application may help characterize molecular pathways influencing protein seed accumulation, transmission, and clearance. In this review we discuss the application of RT-QuIC assays as diagnostic, experimental, and structural tools for detection and discrimination of PrP prions, tau, and αSyn protein seeds.","- Label: Unchanged

In Text B, while extending the context to other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and multiple system atrophy, the underlying connection remains the impairment and accumulation of misfolded proteins which also characterize dementia (particularly Alzheimer's dementia).

44,Dementia,"""Spongy change,"" or vacuolar change, was observed in the neocortex of temporal and frontal lobes in four of 27 patients with clinical and pathologic characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. All four cases had the autosomal dominant form of the disease, and aside from severe dementia, all developed myoclonus and became mute before death. The degeneration observed was unlike that seen in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease because it lacked astrocytosis and had a different distribution of lesions. Moreover, the abundance of neurofibrillary changes and senile plaques was consistent with Alzheimer's disease. None of the other 23 cases were familial, and none developed myoclonus or mutism; three of them had minor vacuolation limited to the temporal lobe. The four cases with severe spongy change described are the first, to our knowledge, in which vacuolar or spongy change has been associated with the familial form of Alzheimer's disease.","Access to comprehensive dementia care is limited.

45,Dementia,"To date, positron emission tomography (PET) has been the only technology for the quantitative imaging of the changes of regional cerebral glucose (rCMRGl) or oxygen metabolism and blood flow (rCBF) associated with psychophysical stimulation and with the performance of mental tasks. So far, the majority of studies performed in healthy subjects demonstrated activation patterns involving not only certain limbic structures, most of all hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampus, and cingulate, but also temporal, parietal, and occipital association cortex, depending on the applied paradigm. Indeed, the closest correlation between regional metabolism and memory test scores was found in mesiotemporal structures during the performance of memory tasks. Metabolic or CBF studies also seem to indicate that memorizing strategies may differ among individuals. PET was repeatedly used to investigate metabolic and/or blood flow abnormalities in patients with various amnestic syndromes. In cases with uni- or bilateral lesions of mesiotemporal structures, caused by surgery, herpes simplex encephalitis, or permanent ischemic, anoxic, or toxic damage, disturbances of metabolism and blood flow typically extended far beyond the morphological defects detected by computed tomography or magnetic resonance. In acute transient global amnesia, CBF and metabolism were decreased bilaterally in the mesiotemporal lobes, where hypometabolism persisted for some time, while higher values were observed in thalamus and some cortical areas. Diencephalic lesions causing Korsakoff's syndrome were associated with decreased rCMRGl in the hippocampal formation, upper brainstem, cingulate, and thalamus. Discrete thalamic infarcts caused amnesia and metabolic depression in the morphologically intact ipsilateral thalamus and in various projection areas of the infarcted nuclei. In ischemic forebrain lesions, amnestic deficits could be related to involvement of the anterior cingulate and of basal cholinergic nuclei. A large number of pathologies are diffusely spread out in the brain and affect partially or predominantly structures in memory processing. This holds true especially in the various dementias where memory disturbances are a consistent and often leading feature. Notably, Alzheimer's disease can be distinguished from other dementias by its characteristic pattern of metabolic dysfunction, with the most prominent changes occurring in parietotemporal and frontal association cortex whose residual metabolism is related to the severity of the disease. Therefore, activation studies using paradigms involving memory functions enhance that typical pattern. Only in the activated state is metabolism of mesiotemporal structures significantly correlated with the performance in memory tests. Other dementias also affect some of the distributed memory networks, with Huntington's disease suggesting a role of the striatum in memory processing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Studies on humans show that depressive disorder is associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive dysfunction, and animal studies suggest that antidepressants may have neuroprotective abilities.

We used register data on all prescribed antidepressants in all patients discharged from psychiatric healthcare service with a diagnosis of depression and with subsequent diagnoses of dementia in Denmark from 1995 to 2005. A total of 37 658 patients with a diagnosis of depression at their first psychiatric contact and who were exposed to antidepressants after discharge were included in the study. A total of 2007 patients (5.3%) were subsequently diagnosed with dementia of any kind. The rate of dementia decreased during periods of two or more prescriptions of older antidepressants compared with the period of only one prescription of older antidepressants [relative risk (RR)=0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.70-0.98)]. This finding was replicated with Alzheimer's disease as the outcome [RR=0.66 (95% CI=0.47-0.94)] but not with dementia of other kinds as the outcome [RR=0.88 (95% CI=0.73-1.06)]. In contrast, during periods of continued use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or newer nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the rate of dementia was not decreased, regardless of the subtype of dementia. It was concluded that continued long-term treatment with older antidepressants is associated with a reduced rate of dementia in patients treated in psychiatric healthcare settings, whereas continued treatment with other kinds of antidepressants is not.

**Text A** discusses dementia in the context of Alzheimer's Disease, presenting a pathology-focused study on the lateral vestibular nucleus and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in patients diagnosed with this type of dementia. The focus lies on the neurological consequences of dementia, particularly the structural integrity of neurons involved in cases of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT).

**Text B** references the term in the scope of diagnosing mild dementia, focusing on the clinical methodology involved in differentiating and assessing dementia's early stages. The description leans towards clinical criteria for recognizing and managing the diagnosis of dementia through patient assessment tools such as the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA).

In both texts, ""dementia"" is consistently used to discuss a neurodegenerative condition affecting cognition and cognitive decline. The medical framework in which ""dementia"" appears, and how it represents a disease state marked by its impact on mental processing, remains substantially consistent despite the twenty plus years separating the texts. This demonstrates that the term ""dementia"" has not undergone significant semantic drift and is still primarily associated with its original clinical implications."
48,Dementia,"Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder associated with cortical atrophy, stereotyped hand movements, dementia, and extrapyramidal dysfunction. Endogenous levels of dopamine and its metabolites are decreased throughout the neocortex and basal ganglia and the number of dopamine type 2 receptors are decreased in the putamen. The present study investigated changes in dopamine uptake sites and dopamine type-1 receptors in the brains of eleven Rett syndrome patients (4-30 yrs) and ten normal female controls (2.5-20 yrs). The number of dopamine type 1 receptors within the caudate nucleus were unchanged. The density of dopamine reuptake sites were unchanged in the cingulate and midfrontal gyri but decreased within the caudate nucleus and putamen. The results of the present study suggest that: 1) in the basal ganglia of Rett syndrome patients, dopamine receptive neurons are intact whereas the number and activity of dopamine terminals are decreased, and 2) in the midfrontal and cingulate cortex, dopaminergic neuronal activity may be increased in order to compensate for fewer terminals that contain less dopamine.","Heart fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) is expressed in the brain and is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with several forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease with dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, whether HFABP in CSF is a stable biomarker or if it can help predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD or VaD has not been well studied. To address the role of HFABP in neurodegeneration, we analyzed CSF levels of HFABP in 96 AD patients and 65 controls and also in 170 patients with MCI with an average follow up time of 5.7 years. For the stability analysis, two CSF samples were collected from 52 AD patients with a six month interval in between. HFABP levels in CSF were very stable over the six month period (r = 0.93, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the CSF levels of HFABP were significantly elevated in AD compared with controls after adjustments for age and gender (p < 0.001). They were also elevated in the patients with MCI that subsequently converted to AD or VaD compared with those that remained stable (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). However, ROC curve analysis showed that HFABP had lesser predictive value in determining conversion from MCI to AD and VaD than Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau. In conclusion, HFABP seems to be a stable CSF biomarker that reflects neuronal cell death in several neurodegenerative disorders, including early stages of AD and VaD.","###Answer:
- Target word: **Dementia**
- Text A: Describes ""dementia"" in the context of Rett syndrome, focusing on specific biochemical and neuroanatomical abnormalities associated with the disorder. It details changes in dopamine system and cortical atrophy directly impacting cognitive functions.
- Text B: Discusses ""dementia"" as part of broader neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's with dementia, Lewy body dementia, and others. It focuses on biometric markers like HFABP levels in the CSF to investigate its role in these diseases, especially in indicating neuronal cell death and predicting the progression from mild cognitive impairment to forms of dementia.

###Label:
- **Changed**

###Reason:
- The semantic drift in the usage of the word ""dementia"" is evident between the two texts. In Text A (related to a specific study within the scope of a single syndrome), ""dementia"" is used to describe a clinical feature associated with Rett syndrome, focusing on direct neurological and biochemical deficits. In Text B, ""dementia"" encompasses a broader range of neurodegenerative diseases, not limited to a singular condition but including a spectrum of disorders. The focus in Text B is also on predictive and diagnostic biomarkers in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a shift towards a broader, more generalized and clinically diagnostic usage. This shows that the connotation and association of ""dementia"" have broadened and shifted towards a more inclusive understanding of various neurodegenerative conditions and their biomarkers, rather than being strictly tied to specific syndromic manifestations."
49,Dementia,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an increased frequency of the apolipoprotein E type epsilon 4 allele. To address both the disease and the allele specificity of this association, we have examined the apolipoprotein E allele distribution in 255 elderly persons including those with autopsy-confirmed AD, senile dementia of the Lewy body type (SDLT), vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD) or Huntington's disease and in nondemented controls either with or without coronary complications. The epsilon 4 allele frequency was increased in SDLT (0.365) and AD (0.328) as compared with controls (0.147), PD (0.098), or Huntington's chorea (0.171). Coronary disease and vascular dementia were associated with marginally higher epsilon 4 allele frequencies than in controls. In PD, amyloid beta-protein accumulated to a greater extent in those cases possessing an epsilon 4 allele than in those without. Those PD cases with dementia were not distinguished from either controls or PD cases without dementia, whether tested biochemically or by apolipoprotein E genotype. It is the comparison of the results in AD and SDLT that yielded the most significant findings. There was a 1.8-fold excess of amyloid beta-protein in AD as compared with controls, and the levels in SDLT were intermediate between those in AD and controls. In contrast, AD was discriminated from both controls and SDLT by the substantial accumulation of paired helical filament tau and phosphorylated tau (both increased more than 20-fold as compared with controls). SDLT was nevertheless characterized by an increased epsilon 4 allele frequency in the absence of significant tau pathology (at least 10-fold less than that in AD). These findings indicate that tau processing is more specifically associated with AD than is amyloid beta-protein accumulation and that presence of the epsilon 4 allele is not an etiological factor that accounts for tau pathology.","Small vessel disease (SVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two common causes of cognitive impairment and dementia, traditionally considered as distinct processes. The relationship between radiological features suggestive of AD and SVD was explored, and the association of each of these features with cognitive status at 1 year was investigated in patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""dementia"" is used to describe a condition associated with cognitive decline related primarily to various underlying pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease. Text A explores the genetic links and pathogenetic differences between different types of dementia, focusing on biochemical mechanisms and genetic markers. Text B discusses the impact of different diseases (SVD and AD) that contribute to dementia, particularly in the context of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Both texts use ""dementia"" to refer to cognitive impairment and decline arising from neurological conditions, showing consistency in the meaning of the term despite the span between the texts and studies of different aspects of the related pathologies."
50,Dementia,"This demonstration evaluates the effects of integrating Alzheimer's Association care consultation service with health care services offered by a large managed care system. The primary hypothesis is that Association care consultation will decrease service utilization, increase satisfaction with managed care, and decrease caregiver depression and care-related strain. Secondary modifying-effects hypotheses posit that the effects of the intervention will be intensified when patients have not received a firm dementia diagnosis, patients have more severe memory problems, caregivers use other Association services in tandem with care consultation, and caregivers are not patients' spouses.","Dementia is a chronic illness without cure or effective treatment, which results in declining mental and physical function and assistance from others to manage activities of daily living. Many people with dementia live in long term care facilities, yet research into their quality of life (QoL) was rare until the last decade. Previous studies failed to incorporate important variables related to the facility and care provision or to look closely at the daily lives of residents. This paper presents a protocol for a comprehensive, multi-perspective assessment of QoL of residents with dementia living in long term care in Australia. A secondary aim is investigating the effectiveness of self-report instruments for measuring QoL.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: 
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" refers to a condition associated with severe memory problems and declining mental function, requiring care support. Text A discusses the impact of care consultation on those with dementia, implying the need for managed health support due to their cognitive impairments. Text B focuses on the chronic nature of dementia and its effects on quality of life, discussing individuals with declining mental and physical functions who necessitate assistance for daily living activities. Both texts thus utilize the term ""dementia"" in a similar manner to describe a medical condition characterized by cognitive decline that impacts daily functioning and necessitates care support. There is no evidence of significant semantic drift in the use of the word between the two texts.
"
51,Dementia,"Due to demographic changes the frequency of dementia is increasing dramatically. About 50-60% of patients with dementia are clinically associated with AD, which is a multifactorial and long-term disease both in clinical and preclinical aspects. Various genetic and non-genetic risk factors play a role in influencing age of onset and disease progression.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major problem of health in developed societies together with cardiovascular disorders and cancer. The lack of accurate diagnostic markers for early prediction and an effective therapy are the two most important problems to efficiently halt disease progression. The pharmacological treatment in AD accounts for 10-20% of direct costs, and less than 20% of AD patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine), with doubtful cost-effectiveness. The neuropathological hallmark of AD (amyloid deposition in senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neuronal loss) are buth the phenotypic expression of a pathogenic process in which more than 200 genes and their products are potentially involved. Drug metabolism, and the mechanisms underlying drug efficacy and safety, are also genetically regulated complex traits in which hundreds of genes cooperatively participate. Structural and functional genomics studies demonstrate that genomic factors, probably induced by environmental factors, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and epigenetic phenomena, might be responsible for AD pathogenic events leading to premature neuronal death. The AD population exhibits a higher genetic variation rate than the control population, with absolute and relative genetic variations of 40-60% and 0.85-1.89%, respectively. AD patients also differ in their genomic architecture from patients with other forms of dementia. Functional genomics studies in AD reveal that age of onset, brain atrophy, cerebrovascular hemodynamics, brain bioelectrical activity, cognitive decline, apoptosis, immune function, lipid metabolism dyshomeostasis, and amyloid deposition are associated with AD-related genes. Pioneering pharmacogenomics studies also demonstrate that the therapeutic response in AD is genotype-specific, with APOE-4/4 carriers as the worst responders to conventional treatments. About 10-20% of Caucasians are carriers of defective CYP2D6 polymorphic variants that alter the metabolism and effects of AD drugs and many psychotropic agents currently administered to patients with dementia. There is a moderate accumulation of AD-related genetic variants of risk in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and ultra-rapid metabolizers, which are the worst responders to conventional drugs. With diverse multifactorial therapies, combining different types of drugs and metabolic factors, it is partially possible to slow-down cognitive deterioration, improving non-cognitive symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, which currently aggravate cognition and increase the difficulties in disease management; however, the association of the APOE-4 allele with specific genetic variants of other genes (e.g., CYP2D6, ACE) negatively modulate the therapeutic response to multifactorial treatments affecting cognition, mood and behaviour. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 60-90% of drug variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics. The incorporation of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic protocols to AD research and clinical practice can foster therapeutics optimization by helping to develop cost-effective pharmaceuticals and improving drug efficacy and safety.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: 
In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" is used primarily to refer to a decline in cognitive function due to disease, primarily affecting elderly patients (here specifically highlighted as Alzheimer's disease, AD). Text A discusses dementia in general terms, focusing on demographic changes and its association with Alzheimer's disease as well as genetic and non-genetic risk factors that influence the disease's progression. Text B, while being more specific and detailed in discussing Alzheimer's disease as a form of dementia, still uses ""dementia"" in the same overarching context of cognitive decline and disease progression. Therefore, noting that the fundamental meaning presented in both texts aligns and refers consistently to a medical condition characterized by deterioration in memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday activities, we see that the core meaning of ""dementia"" does not exhibit a significant shift over time. This interpretation supports the label ""Unchanged."""
52,Dementia,"A 53-year-old male with thalamic degeneration is presented. He had double vision, cerebellar signs, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts signs in addition to hypersomnia, decrease in spontaneity and attention, and impairment of memory as psychic symptoms. These signs and symptoms were progressive, and he subsequently developed akinetic mutism and died of pneumonia 17 months after the onset of the disease. His clinical diagnosis was considered as Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome due to progressive dementia, cerebellar signs and the other signs mentioned above. The postmortem pathological investigations, however, revealed thalamic degeneration. The pathological observations showed marked loss of nerve cells and glial proliferation in the medial and anterior nuclei of thalamus. The same pathological changes were more or less demonstrated in the pulvinar, the periaqueductal gray matter of midbrain, inferior olivary nucleus, the medial parts of globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the dentate nucleus. In the early stage of the clinical course, it was difficult to know whether the main symptoms were caused by dementia or by the disturbance of consciousness. Retrospective considerations, however, showed that dementia had appeared at first, and subsequently the disturbance of consciousness had joined. As the result, it seems that they finally caused akinetic mutism. It is known as thalamic dementia that in the cerebrovascular disease the lesions in the medial and anterior parts of bilateral non-specific thalamic nuclei cause dementia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Impaired empathy is a diagnostic feature of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), but it is not clear whether it is caused by a primary impairment in empathy or by general emotional blunting.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" continues to describe a state of severe impairment of cognitive functions that significantly interferes with daily living and personal independence. In Text A from the earlier period, dementia is discussed in relation to thalamic degeneration, focusing on memory impairment and progressive decline that leads to severe neurological symptoms. In Text B from the later period, the discussion revolves around behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), specifically noting impaired empathy as a symptomatic manifestation. Despite differences in specific symptoms and types of dementia discussed, the core meaning of the word ""dementia"" – referring to a clinical syndrome characterized by a decay in cognitive ability – remains consistent across both texts. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning of the word between these periods."
53,Dementia,"The limbic system refers to the part of the brain that is involved in emotional expression and in cognitive and somatomotor control systems; it most likely also has a significant role in the pathogenesis of certain dementias, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and seizure disorders. This system, as originally defined, has no clear anatomic boundaries. Limbic regions of the telencephalon include a continuous medial zone of cortical regions, including the hippocampal formation; a perihippocampal zone, including the cingulate gyrus, prefrontal region, and perirhinal region; along with subcortical areas, including the septum pellucidum and the amygdala. A distinguishing characteristic of the limbic region is that it is highly interconnected and appears to form the only major route for information transfer between the neocortex and the hypothalamus. With the multiplanar capability and resolution of MR imaging, the individual parts of the limbic system and the diseases that affect them can be studied. In this review, we discuss MR imaging of the diseases that affect this system.","We investigated disease notification and self-determination in treatment decisions of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). For this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed 18 patients with CJD (sporadic:familial = 14:4) who were admitted to our hospital. The durations from symptom onset to the time of diagnosis ranged from 0.3 to 48 months (median, 2 months). The Hasegawa Dementia Scale-revised (HDS-R) range was 0 to 29 (median, 5.0); however, 4 patients (22%), including 2 with familial CJD and 2 with sporadic CJD, maintained cognitive function (HDS-R score ≥ 21). Two patients (11%), who satisfied Lo's criteria for self-determination, were given a disease notification, and both of them archived self-determination in treatment decisions. In conclusion, we demonstrated that patients with CJD could be given a disease notification and archive self-determination in treatment decisions upon early diagnosis using DWI. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" maintains its meaning as related to cognitive dysfunction and decline. Text A discusses the role of the limbic system in dementia, identifying it as part of the pathogenesis in certain types of dementias, which refers to a decline in cognitive abilities and the occurrence of neuropsychiatric disturbances. Text B uses the term within the context of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, maintaining the focus on cognitive function as it discusses patients' cognitive abilities using the Hasegawa Dementia Scale-revised (HDS-R). Both contexts portray ""dementia"" in its consistent medical and neurological sense related to cognitive impairment, showing no significant semantic drift between the two time periods."
54,Dementia,"The tau protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-tau) were examined in 27 patients with alcohol dependence (20 demented and 7 nondemented), 36 age and dementia severity-matched patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 23 age-matched normal control subjects. The CSF-tau levels in the demented alcoholic group (alcohol-induced organic brain disorders, 25.4 +/- 10.2 pg/ml) was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than that in the AD group (96.1 +/- 53.3 pg/ml), but not significantly different from that in the nondemented alcoholics (18.1 +/- 10.2 pg/ml) or the controls (19.2 +/- 12.9 pg/ml). Using a 44.9 pg/ml as a cut-off value (mean + 2 SD of the normal control group), only one patient with alcohol-induced organic brain disorders exceeded the value, whereas 3 of 36 of the AD group showed CSF-tau levels less than this level. These findings suggest that alcohol-induced organic brain disorders are a group of dementias that are characterized by normal CSF-tau levels, and that the CSF examination for tau in combination with other clinical findings may help in differentiating alcohol-induced organic brain disorders from AD.","Depression is one of the most frequent and burdensome non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), across all stages. Even when its severity is mild, PD depression has a great impact on quality of life for these patients and their caregivers. Accordingly, accurate diagnosis, supported by validated scales, identification of risk factors, and recognition of motor and non-motor symptoms comorbid to depression are critical to understanding the neurobiology of depression, which in turn determines the effectiveness of dopaminergic drugs, antidepressants and non-pharmacological interventions. Recent advances using in vivo functional and structural imaging demonstrate that PD depression is underpinned by dysfunction of limbic networks and monoaminergic systems, depending on the stage of PD and its associated symptoms, including apathy, anxiety, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), cognitive impairment and dementia. In particular, the evolution of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormalities of limbic circuits across time, involving the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala, thalamus and ventral striatum, help to delineate the variable expression of depression in patients with prodromal, early and advanced PD. Evidence is accumulating to support the use of dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (desipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine) in patients with PD and moderate to severe depression, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive behavioral therapy may also be considered. In all patients, recent findings advocate that optimization of dopamine replacement therapy and evaluation of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus to improve motor symptoms represents an important first step, in addition to physical activity. Overall, this review indicates that increasing understanding of neurobiological changes help to implement a roadmap of tailored interventions for patients with PD and depression, depending on the stage and comorbid symptoms underlying PD subtypes and their prognosis.","### Answer:

55,Dementia,"Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familial disease characterized by tendon-xanthomas, cataracts, progressive cerebellar ataxia, dementia and an elevation of serum cholestanol with normal levels of cholesterol. Although the pathogenesis of CTX is not fully understood, increment of cholestanol is suggested one of the major metabolic derangements of the disease. Recently, the LDL-apheresis has been developed as a new therapeutical equipment in the field of hyperlipidemia and been widely used to reduce the levels of LDL-cholesterol by selective LDL adsorption. From the point of view that cholestanol is involved mainly in LDL-cholesterol (1.019 less than d less than 1.063), we used this LDL-apheresis in the aim of reducing the cholestanol in 58 years old woman with typical sign and symptoms of CTX. The levels of serum cholestanol and cholesterol before the treatment with LDL-apheresis, were 10.7 micrograms/ml and 175 mg/dl respectively. Also the ratio of cholestanol/cholesterol indicated 0.63. By the first procedure of apheresis, the level of cholestanol was markedly decreased to 5.2 micrograms/ml (50%). Several LDL-apheresis treatments were carried out once a month. During 5 months treatments, neurological deterioration was arrested, dementia which included disorientation and recent-memory loss, cleaned a little. Although the xanthomas did not decrease in size, this patients was better oriented to person, place, time and was able to speak rationally, 2nd her cerebellar dysfunction revealed improvement. From our new experiments-we believe that the LDL-apheresis offers the strong hope of preventing the progress on cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) determines gradual loss of cognition and memory function, eventually leading to clinical manifest dementia. The pathogenic mechanisms of AD remain elusive and treatment options unsatisfactory, targeting only symptoms like memory loss, behavior changes, sleep disorders and seizures. These therapies are not stopping the disease's progression, at their best they can only delay it. Accumulating evidence suggests that AD is associated with a microglial dysfunction. Microglia are resident immune cells that provide continuous surveillance within the brain. When excessively activated, microglial response can also have detrimental effects via the exacerbation of inflammatory processes and release of neurotoxic substances. Recently, it was recognized that microglia express voltage-gated ion channels, in particularly voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). Pharmacological block of VGSC has been attempted symptomatically in AD to control the epileptic features often associated with AD, as well as to relieve detrimental behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. The success of VGSC treatment in AD was unexpectedly variable, ranging from very beneficial to plain detrimental. This variability could not be satisfactorily explained solely by the neuronal effects. This article will try to discuss possible implication of microglial VGSC dysfunction in AD according to available data, own personal experience of the authors and propose a new way to investigate its possible implications.

- Reason: In Text A, the term *dementia* is primarily associated with the progressive neurological deterioration linked to a rare familial disease (Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis), and it highlights specific symptoms like disorientation and recent-memory loss as part of the disease's manifestation. The focus is on the physical and metabolic aspects of dementia related to this specific disease, and how therapeutic interventions like LDL-apheresis can alleviate these symptoms.

In Text B, the context in which *dementia* is used has shifted significantly towards a broader, more general understanding as seen in the context of Alzheimer's disease. It discusses the complex role of microglia and ion channels in the brain concerning dementia, expanding the scope to include neurobiological, immunological, and molecular dimensions. The term here is linked with a wider array of symptoms and underlying pathological processes, moving beyond just the symptomatic description to involve discussions about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that could potentially be targeted for therapy. This indicates a shift from a more straightforward symptom-focused understanding of dementia towards a deeper exploration of its multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms and broader implications in neurodegenerative diseases beyond specific conditions. This represents a significant semantic drift in the understanding and scope of 'dementia' over time."
56,Dementia,"The aim of this study was to examine the changes of activities of daily living and with quality of life of patients in a special nursing home founded in 1997 in Tsuwano Town, Shimane.

- Target word: Dementia
- Text A: Dementia in this context refers to the condition primarily among elderly patients in a nursing home and focuses on assessing mental decline using various metrics like Hasegawa's dementia rating scale and other psychological evaluations related to quality of life and daily living activities. It describes a progressive medical condition affecting mental cognitive tasks such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.
- Text B: Dementia here specifically relates to Parkinson's disease and associated dementia (PD-D). The use involves examining a particular phenomenon called the Closing-in (CI) phenomenon in patients affected by PD-D and explores cognitive deficits related to attention and executive functions which are specific traits of dementia due to Parkinson's disease.

- Reason: In both texts, although the contexts and specific details vary—Text A focusing on general aging-related dementia and its impact on daily functions in a nursing context, and Text B discussing dementia as linked specifically to Parkinson’s disease—the core meaning of ""dementia"" as a condition involving cognitive and executive dysfunction remains consistent. Both texts treat dementia as a decline in mental abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life, specifically within psychological and neurological frameworks. The essence and semantic content of the word ""dementia"" showing progressive cognitive decline in varied contexts have not shifted significantly despite the different specific settings and associated conditions.

57,Dementia,"In normoglycemic patients with either incipient early-onset or incipient late-onset dementia of the Alzheimer type, the predominant disturbance consisted of a significant reduction in cerebral glucose utilization. Alterations in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption first occurred in late-onset dementia types. In advanced late-onset dementia, these parameters had decreased most severely. The calculated ATP production rate from glucose indicated a drastic loss of energy in all patients studied. As not all oxygen consumed by the brain was used for glucose oxidation, oxidation of substrates other than glucose (endogenous amino acids and free fatty acids) is assumed to minimize the energy loss from glucose. The possibility that the abnormalities in oxidative and energy metabolism in dementias of the Alzheimer's type are due to metabolic abnormalities in glycolytic glucose breakdown and pyruvate oxidation, rather than to an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, is discussed.","The presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI imaging confers an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death.

#### Reason:
In both texts, the target word ""Dementia"" is utilized to discuss cognitive decline associated with alterations in brain function, maintaining a consistent medical context across the years. Text A from an earlier period focuses on metabolic and oxidative disturbances in dementia related to Alzheimer's, particularly emphasizing the reduced cerebral glucose utilization, which directly affects energy metabolism in the brain of dementia patients. Text B, from a more recent time, discusses the association of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) with an increased risk of dementia in the context of stroke, still focusing on pathological changes in the brain but with a slight shift to imaging diagnostics and its correlation to brain function impairment leading to dementia.

In both cases, ""dementia"" retains its core meaning of significant cognitive decline due to brain pathology, whether due to metabolic changes or structural damages visible on modern imaging techniques. There is no significant change in the basic understanding or application of the term ""dementia"" between the two texts despite advancements in medical imaging and understanding of associated risk factors. Hence, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
58,Dementia,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. However, mechanisms underlying HIV-1 gene expression in the CNS are poorly understood. The importance of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) for HIV-1 expression in cells of the immune system has been recently reported. In this study, we have examined the role and the molecular mechanisms by which proteins of the C/EBP family regulate HIV-1 gene transcription in human brain cells. We found that NF-IL6 acts as a potent activator of the long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription in microglial and oligodendroglioma cells. In contrast, C/EBPgamma inhibits NF-IL6-induced activation. Consistent with previous data, our transient expression results show cell-type-specific NF-IL6-mediated transactivation. In glial cells, full activation needs the presence of the C/EBP binding sites; however, NF-IL6 is still able to function via the minimal -40/+80 region. In microglial cells, C/EBP sites are not essential, since NF-IL6 acts through the -68/+80 LTR region, containing two binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Moreover, we show that functional interactions between NF-IL6 and Sp1 lead to synergistic transcriptional activation of the LTR in oligodendroglioma and to mutual repression in microglial cells. We further demonstrate that NF-IL6 physically interacts with the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), via its DNA binding domain, in vitro and in cells, which results in mutual transcriptional repression. These findings reveal how the interplay of NF-IL6 and C/EBPgamma, together with Sp1 and COUP-TF, regulates HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells.",Day-respite care opportunities for people with dementia help prevent informal carer burnout and enable ageing in place.

The focus is on the social support and care for individuals with dementia, emphasizing carer experiences and preventive care to manage the general condition of dementia, not linked to any specific disease like HIV. Thus, the term ""dementia"" has shifted from a specific disease-associated application to a more generally applied term referring to a broader category of cognitive decline conditions and their social care aspects."
59,Dementia,"Dementias and other severe cognitive dysfunction states pose a daunting challenge to existing medical management strategies. An integrative, early intervention approach seems warranted. Whereas, allopathic treatment options are highly limited, nutritional and botanical therapies are available which have proven degrees of efficacy and generally favorable benefit-to-risk profiles. This review covers five such therapies: phosphatidylserine (PS), acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC), vinpocetine, Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE), and Bacopa monniera (Bacopa). PS is a phospholipid enriched in the brain, validated through double-blind trials for improving memory, learning, concentration, word recall, and mood in middle-aged and elderly subjects with dementia or age-related cognitive decline. PS has an excellent benefit-to-risk profile. ALC is an energizer and metabolic cofactor which also benefits various cognitive functions in the middle-aged and elderly, but with a slightly less favorable benefit-to-risk profile. Vinpocetine, found in the lesser periwinkle Vinca minor, is an excellent vasodilator and cerebral metabolic enhancer with proven benefits for vascular-based cognitive dysfunction. Two meta-analyses of GbE demonstrate the best preparations offer limited benefits for vascular insufficiencies and even more limited benefits for Alzheimer's, while ""commodity"" GbE products offer little benefit, if any at all. GbE (and probably also vinpocetine) is incompatible with blood-thinning drugs. Bacopa is an Ayurvedic botanical with apparent anti-anxiety, anti-fatigue, and memory-strengthening effects. These five substances offer interesting contributions to a personalized approach for restoring cognitive function, perhaps eventually in conjunction with the judicious application of growth factors.","We present the multi-dimensional Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) surface, a plot of the true classification rates of tests based on levels of biological markers, for multi-group discrimination, as an extension of the ROC curve, commonly used in two-group diagnostic testing. The volume under this surface (VUS) is a global accuracy measure of a test to classify subjects in multiple groups and useful to detect trends in marker measurements. We used three-dimensional ROC surfaces, and associated VUS, to discriminate between HIV-negative (NEG), HIV-positive neurologically asymptomatic (NAS) subjects and patients with AIDS demential complex (ADC), using brain metabolites measured by proton MRS. These were ratios of markers of inflammation, Choline (Cho) and myoinositol (MI), and brain injury, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), divided by Creatine (Cr), measured in the basal ganglia and the frontal white matter. Statistically significant trends were observed in the three groups with respect to MI/Cr (VUS=0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.53), Cho/Cr (0.36; 0.27-0.45) in the basal ganglia and NAA/Cr in the frontal white matter (FWM) (0.29; 0.20-0.38), suggesting a continuum of injury during the neurologically asymptomatic stage of HIV infection, particularly with respect to brain inflammation. Adjusting for age increased the combined classification accuracy of age and NAA/Cr (p=0.053). Pairwise comparisons suggested that neuronal damage associated with NAA/Cr decreases was mainly observed in individuals with ADC, raising issues of synergism between HIV infection and age and possible acceleration of neurological deterioration in an aging HIV-positive population. The three-dimensional ROC surface and its associated VUS are useful for assessing marker accuracy, detecting data trends and offering insight in disease processes affecting multiple groups.","###Answer:

- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" is used within the context of cognitive decline and impairment. Text A discusses various therapies to manage dementia and related cognitive dysfunctions, focusing on their efficacy and risk profiles, as part of the medical management of dementia. It maintains the theme around treating the conditions and improving cognitive functions after diagnosis. Text B, while more focused on diagnostic measures and markers of dementia through biological data (in the context of HIV), still addresses dementia as a set of cognitive symptoms and conditions linked to diseases like HIV. In both cases, ""dementia"" refers to significant cognitive decay and dysfunction, reflecting consistency in semantic maintenance across the time frames. The concept and medical understanding of dementia as cognitive impairment remain fundamentally the same, focusing on diagnosis, management, and related dysfunctionality of the brain in both texts."
60,Dementia,"Delirium is more common in older adults because of normal physiologic changes, increased incidence of medical illnesses, and increased medication use in this population. Older dementing patients are particularly predisposed to delirium because of associated neurologic abnormalities. Delirium often is superimposed on a dementing condition and may be difficult to differentiate from atypical dementia or a catastrophic reaction. Accurate diagnosis is essential, as is a thorough search for an underlying cause. The delirium will usually resolve if the underlying cause is properly treated. Treatment also requires maintaining a comfortable environment for the patient and, when necessary, administering a high-potency neuroleptic.","There is an urgent need for biomarkers to enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has recently been shown that a variant within the clusterin gene is associated with increased risk of AD and plasma levels of clusterin have been found to be associated with the risk of AD. We, therefore, investigated the diagnostic value of clusterin by quantifying clusterin using an ELISA in plasma from 171 controls, 127 patients with AD, 82 patients with other dementias and 30 patients with depression. We observed similar plasma clusterin levels in controls, AD patients and patients with other dementias, suggesting that plasma clusterin levels have no diagnostic value for AD. There was a slight, but significant, increase in plasma clusterin in patients with depression compared to all other groups tested, which may warrant further investigation.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" refers primarily to a decline or impairment in mental capacity, particularly involving neurological conditions or diseases impacting cognitive abilities. Text A discusses challenges in diagnosing and treating delirium in patients with dementia, highlighting the neurologic abnormalities and overlaps with other conditions like delirium. Text B explores the search for biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease as a form of dementia, focusing on the search for diagnostic tools in distinguishing and understanding various dementia-related conditions. Both texts maintain the core concept of dementia as related to cognitive and neurological disorders, thus demonstrating that the word ""dementia"" has not undergone a significant shift in meaning or connotation across the provided texts."
61,Dementia,A consultation-liaison psychiatry program in a teaching nursing home helped implement six guiding principles including: make the patient human to the staff; assume no behavior is random; look for depression of psychosis as a source of problems; reduce medications and medication doses; create a more homelike environment; and use conditions in which learning still occurs in dementia.,"Disturbed sleep places older adults at higher risk for frailty, morbidity, and even mortality. Yet, nursing home routines frequently disturb residents' sleep through use of noise, light, or efforts to reduce incontinence. Nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and or related dementias-almost two-thirds of long-stay nursing home residents-are likely to be particularly affected by sleep disturbance. Addressing these issues, this study protocol implements an evidence-based intervention to improve sleep: a nursing home frontline staff huddling program known as LOCK. The LOCK program is derived from evidence supporting strengths-based learning, systematic observation, relationship-based teamwork, and efficiency.","###Answer:

- **Reason:** In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" refers to a medical condition affecting primarily the elderly, characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. In Text A, the focus is on addressing behaviors associated with dementia in a nursing home through holistic and empathetic approaches. Text B discusses the impact of environmental factors like sleep disturbances on residents with dementia, such as those with Alzheimer's disease, in a nursing home setting. Despite the different focus of interventions (behavioral management in Text A and sleep improvement in Text B), the underlying understanding and usage of the word ""dementia"" in both texts remain consistent as a medical syndrome involving cognitive decline. Thus, there is no significant shift or semantic drift in the meaning of ""dementia"" between the two texts."
62,Dementia,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive disorder characterized by cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, central to which are deficits in the cholinergic and other neurotransmitter systems. These results in the essential symptoms of dementia, including impairment of memory, judgment, and abstract thinking. The pharmacologic relationships among the various neurotransmitters (e.g., cholinergic, serotonergic, nicotinic, and dopaminergic) are highly complex and are still being investigated. Information on the pharmacologic basis of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in AD has applications to drug therapy. One method of obtaining this information is by pharmacomodeling, using individual or combined drugs. Joint cholinergic antagonism with both muscarinic and nicotinic blockade combines to produce short-term memory impairment, which approximates to mild AD in normal elderly people. This effect is better than that achieved with either agent alone. Mixed cholinergic and serotonergic antagonism has an effect on the cognitive function of AD patients and on depression-related behavior. Dopaminergic dysfunction is linked with the development of hallucinatory and psychotic symptoms and may also be involved in dysfunction of verbal fluency. Combination pharmacomodeling allows the various behavioral and cognitive deficits in AD to be studied and allows models for drug trials to be developed.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between homocysteine (Hcy), folate and vitamin B12 levels in vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer Disease (AD) to elucidate if they had similar pathogenesis due to cerebrovascular injury.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" maintains a medical and pathological context related to cognitive impairment typically associated with diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD). Text A discusses dementia as integral to the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease such as memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction, highlighting the role of neurotransmitters in these processes. Text B associates dementia with vascular factors and seeks to establish biochemical links (through homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 levels) between two types of dementia, suggesting a continued focus on biological and medical explanations for the condition. The usage of ""dementia"" does not show a noticeable change in contextual meaning or connotation between the two texts, thus illustrating that the meaning remains consistent and focused on a medical viewpoint of cognitive decline associated with neurological conditions."

In addition to some lifestyle interventions, there is room for the use of nutraceuticals/functional foods as pharma-nutritional tools to lessen the burden of cognitive decline before it worsens. We previously reported the promising molecular actions of milk fat globule membranes and krill oil concentrates in a rat model of aging. In this study, we concentrated on the activities on cognition, using an array of validated tests. We also performed lipidomic analyses of plasma, erythrocytes, and different brain areas. We report lower emotional memory (contextual fear conditioning) in aged rats supplemented with concentrates of polar lipids from buttermilk or krill oil at doses that approximate human consumption. No other behavioral parameter was significantly influenced by the supplements, calling for further research to confirm or not the purported salubrious activities of polar lipids, namely those rich in ω3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, on cognitive decline.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""dementia"" is used to refer to a significant cognitive decline associated with conditions like Alzheimer's disease or other forms of cognitive deterioration related to aging or disease processes. Text A discusses dementia in the context of a study involving patients with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD), focusing on the association of dementia onset with mortality. Text B talks about the potential interventions to address cognitive decline, which can range to dementia, discussing preventive or therapeutic approaches in the context of aging. In both cases, ""dementia"" refers to a severe loss of cognitive ability in individuals, consistent with its standard medical definition. Thus, there is no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of the term ""dementia"" between the two texts over time."
64,Dementia,Controversy exists as to whether dementia patients should be told their diagnosis and prognosis.,"Older persons with mental disorders, excluding dementia disorders, constitute a vulnerable group of people. With the future international increase in the older population, mental disorders will increase as well, thus entailing new challenges for their caregivers. These older persons often remain in their own homes, and in Sweden they are cared for by nursing aides. With little previous research, an increased workload and facing new strenuous situations, it is important to make use of the knowledge the nursing aides possess and to deepen the understanding of their experiences. The study aimed at illuminating the meaning of caring for older persons with mental disorders as experienced by nursing aides in the municipal home help service. Interviews with nine female nursing aides were performed and analysed with a phenomenological hermeneutical research method inspired by the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. Being altruistically egoistic emerged as a main theme in the nursing aides' narratives. The nursing aides' experiences could be interpreted as a movement between being altruistic and egoistic. The findings revealed a continuous distancing by the nursing aides and their struggle to redress the balance between their altruistic and egoistic actions. Caring for these older persons constitutes a complex situation where distancing functions as a recourse to prioritize oneself and to diminish the value of caring. The study suggests that an increased knowledge base on older persons with mental disorders, followed by continuous supervision, is necessary for the nursing aides to improve the quality of the care given.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is used to describe a cognitive disorder primarily characterized by memory, thinking, and social impairments that interfere significantly with daily functioning and activities. Text A focuses on the ethical considerations regarding the communication of a dementia diagnosis to patients, while Text B discusses the broader context of caring for older persons with mental disorders, including those with dementia. Although Text B discusses dementia within a broader scope of mental disorders and caregiving challenges, the fundamental meaning of the term ""dementia"" as a cognitive disorder remains consistent between the two texts. There is no evidence of a semantic shift in how ""dementia"" is described or understood between the two periods. The term continues to specifically refer to a set of symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning."
65,Dementia,"The concept of heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease is based on molecular, neuropathological, clinical and neuropsychological features, and also supported by the observation that Alzheimer's patients differ in their response to pharmacological interventions. Recent investigations evaluating the therapeutic potential of cholinesterase inhibitors have disclosed the existence of at least two subsets of patients with dementia, defined as 'responders' and 'nonresponders' to this therapy. In this article, Paolo Liberini and colleagues suggest that the cluster of responders to the cholinesterase inhibitors might include a significant number of subjects with a rather selective dysfunction of the cholinergic system, as in the case of Lewy-body dementia. A neuropathological demonstration of this correlation should open up new therapeutic perspectives."," Atrial fibrillation (AF) adversely impacts mortality, stroke, heart failure, and dementia. AF ablation eliminates AF in most patients. We evaluated the long-term impact of AF ablation on mortality, heart failure (HF), stroke, and dementia in a large system-wide patient population.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is used to refer to a declined cognitive function that severely impacts daily functioning and is associated with various brain diseases. Text A discusses dementia in the context of Alzheimer's disease and differential responses to medical treatments (cholinesterase inhibitors), mentioning specific subtypes like Lewy-body dementia, which points to neuropathological evidence impacting therapy approaches. Text B refers to dementia in a broader context involving its association with atrial fibrillation and evaluating the effects of AF ablation on dementia among other health outcomes. Although Text B connects dementia with physical conditions and procedures (e.g., AF ablation), it still fundamentally refers to it as a cognitive impairment condition, similar to its usage in Text A. Therefore, the essential meaning of dementia as a significant cognitive impairment linked to brain conditions remains consistent across the two time periods."
66,Dementia,"Performance profiles of patients with different dementia syndromes (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) were compared with each other and with those of neurologically impaired and healthy individuals without dementia on a new instrument for screening dementia, the Cross-Cultural Cognitive Examination (CCCE). The CCCE measures discriminated reliably between nondemented and demented patients, regardless of etiology. Comparisons between dementia groups found that dementia patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) showed more severe psychomotor slowing and depression, compared with patients with Alzheimer's disease, who showed more impaired recall of recently learned verbal information and verbal abstract reasoning. The CCCE also distinguished between the motor and affective symptoms that are common to all PD patients and the dementia symptoms that occur in some PD patients. These results provide further support for the clinical utility of the CCCE for discriminating dementia from normal cognitive functioning and for initial identification of different dementia syndromes.",The aim of this literature review was to assess the effects of Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) on elderly patients with dementia or various psychiatric disorders.,"Label: Unchanged

Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is used to refer to a cognitive decline associated with various neurological conditions affecting the brain, predominantly seen in older individuals. Text A is focused on comparing dementia syndromes in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, describing various symptoms and the utility of a specific clinical instrument in distinguishing between types of dementia. Text B addresses how Animal-Assisted Interventions impact elderly patients with dementia. In both texts, ""dementia"" clearly refers to the clinical, psychological, and cognitive implications typical of the condition without straying significantly in meaning or connotation. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning of ""dementia"" between the two texts, indicating the term remains consistent across the twenty-year span between the texts."
67,Dementia,"A 30-year-old female received a head injury at the age of 22 years. Subsequently neurological and psychiatric symptoms, such as personality change, urinary incontinence, dementia and gait disturbance developed. On admission, her cognitive function was severely impaired. Brain CT disclosed cerebral atrophy, dilatation of the lateral ventricle and calcification of the basal ganglia. Pathologically membranous structures were recognized in bone marrow. On the basis of these clinical findings, a diagnosis of Nasu-Hakola's disease was made. In this case, a T2-weighted MRI finding of reduced signal intensity in the thalamus and putamen was characteristic. This finding may be related to intracranial calcification.","Recent reviews of evidence-based treatment for depression did not identify behavioral activation as an evidence-based practice. Therefore, this article conducted a systematic review of behavioral activation treatment of depression, which identified three meta-analyses, one recent randomized controlled trial and one recent follow-up of an earlier randomized control trial. Behavioral activation was consistently superior to wait list and treatment as usual control groups. Effect sizes were not different from cognitive behavior therapy or cognitive therapy, both post-treatment and at follow-up. Indeed, behavioral activation may be more effective than cognitive therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in terms of lower dropout. Behavioral activation, like cognitive behavior therapy, may be superior to paroxitine because it results in less relapse and recurrence, may be substantially cheaper, and does not have risks of pharmacotherapy. There is some evidence that behavioral activation may also be useful with some people for whom cognitive and cognitive-behavior therapy is less effective, such as those with severe, lifelong depression, people with substance abuse and people with dementia and severe depression. There is now sufficient evidence to conclude that behavioral activation is an evidence-based therapy.","- Label: Unchanged

68,Dementia,"Tau is a multifunctional protein that was originally identified as a microtubule-associated protein. In patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, mutations in the gene encoding tau (MAPT) have been identified that disrupt the normal binding of tau to tubulin resulting in pathological deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau. Abnormal filamentous tau deposits have been reported as a pathological characteristic in several other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia, Pick Disease, Alzheimer disease, argyrophilic grain disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In the last five years, extensive research has identified 34 different pathogenic MAPT mutations in 101 families worldwide. In vitro, cell-free and transfected cell studies have provided valuable information on tau dysfunction and transgenic mice carrying human MAPT mutations are being generated to study the influence of MAPT mutations in vivo. This mutation update describes the considerable differences in clinical and pathological presentation of patients with MAPT mutations and summarizes the effect of the different mutations on tau functioning. In addition, the role of tau as a genetic susceptibility factor is discussed, together with the genetic evidence for additional causal genes for tau-positive as well as tau-negative dementia.","Researchers typically study physiological responses either after stimulus onset or when the emotional valence of an upcoming stimulus is revealed. Yet, participants may also respond when they are told that an emotional stimulus is about to be presented even without knowing its valence.

In Text B, the text discusses the diagnostic challenges associated with dementia, specifically dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing it from other similar neurodegenerative diseases due to overlapping symptoms. 
Both texts, though dealing with different aspects of dementia (misdiagnosis in one, diagnostic challenges in differentiating from other diseases in another), maintain the core meaning of dementia as related to cognitive decline.

71,Dementia,"Japan started long-term care insurance for nursing and home help services in April 2000 to cope with growing medical expenditures for the population aged over 65. To study the impact of the new insurance on utilization of dementia care, we compared demographic and clinical characteristics including diagnosis, degree of disability and behavioral disturbance before and after the launch among people with dementia covered by either long-term care or medical insurance. The subjects of the study were randomly selected patients/residents of specialized dementia care units in both psychiatric hospitals and geriatric care facilities before (1145 patients/residents in early 2000) and after (262 for medical insurance and 205 for long-term care insurance in 2001) the new system was launched. Although patients/residents in 2000 and 2001 were similar as a whole, the 2001 sample showed differences between patients in each of the types of insurance systems. Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients/residents covered by long-term care insurance were significantly more likely to be females and require higher levels of care. Patients covered by long-term care insurance were significantly less likely to be transferred from a psychiatric department nor did they display behavioral disturbance or an inability to put out or deal with fire. These results suggest that health care facilities have shifted to the new insurance system for patients requiring higher levels of care but without behavioral disturbances as it was intended. On the other hand, there were policy concerns of that demented persons with moderate activities of daily living impairments and behavioral disturbances would be at risk being excluded from the long-term care scheme.","Previous studies have shown a selective reduction of von Economo neurons (VENs) in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, the alleged selectivity rests on the comparison between VENs and other neurons in cortical layer V, while it has been established that neurons in the superficial cortical layers (I-III) are particularly affected in bvFTD. The purpose of this study was to examine loss the loss of VENs in comparison with that of non-VEN-neurons of superficial cortical layers. VENs and non-VEN-neurons of cortical layer V and layers II+III were quantified in the anterior cingulate cortex in 16 cases of bvFTD, 12 non-demented controls and 10 cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In bvFTD VENs were more depleted than non-VEN-neurons of layers V and II+III. Also, non-VEN-neurons of layer II+III showed a greater density reduction than those of layer V in bvFTD. VEN density was also reduced in AD, albeit to a lesser extent than in bvFTD, and the differences between bvFTD and AD were only significant when relating VEN loss to that of layer V neurons.

The pathological findings were those of Huntington disease (atrophy with neuronal loss and astrocytosis in the neostriatum) and Alzheimer disease (neuronal loss with numerous senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex). Ultrastructural study of neurofibrillary tangles showed that they were composed of twisted tubules similar to those found in Alzheimer disease.,"The proximal aorta acts as a coupling device between heart and brain perfusion, modulating the amount of pressure and flow pulsatility transmitted into the cerebral microcirculation. Stiffening of the proximal aorta is strongly associated with age and hypertension. The detrimental effects of aortic stiffening may result in brain damage as well as heart failure. The resulting cerebral small vessel disease and heart failure may contribute to early cognitive decline and (vascular) dementia. This pathophysiological sequence of events underscores the role of cardiovascular disease as a contributory mechanism in causing cognitive decline and dementia and potentially may provide a starting point for prevention and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging is well suited to assess the function of the proximal aorta and the left ventricle (eg, aortic arch pulse wave velocity and distensibility) as well as the various early and late manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease (eg, microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities in strategically important regions of the brain). Specialized magnetic resonance imaging techniques are explored for diagnosing preclinical changes in white matter integrity or brain microvascular pulsatility.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the word ""dementia"" retains a similar meaning focusing on cognitive decline linked to brain histopathology and systemic conditions affecting the brain, respectively. Text A illustrates dementia as part of the clinical presentation and pathology of Huntington and Alzheimer diseases, emphasizing neurodegeneration and its anatomical correlates. Text B discusses dementia in the context of cardiovascular contributions to cognitive decline, particularly through mechanisms like aortic stiffening influencing brain microcirculation and increasing the risk of vascular dementia. Both texts align in depicting dementia as a state of cognitive impairment, although the factors leading to or associated with it vary (neurodegenerative in Text A versus cardiovascular in Text B). The core concept of dementia as significant cognitive decline remains constant across the given time frames, thus signaling no substantial semantic drift in the term's usage."
74,Dementia,"Polygraphic recordings of wake and sleep were performed on 10 partly bed-ridden, severely deteriorated patients with senile dementia. Compared with healthy elderly persons these subjects showed less SWS (slow wave sleep, characterized by high amplitude, slow EEG waves), less REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep, usually accompanied by dream activity) and poorly organized stage 2 sleep (no sleep spindles, i.e. phasic EEG activity with a frequency of 12-14 Hz). Six of the 10 patients had no dominant alpha rhythm during wakefulness; this seemed to be related to their more deteriorated clinical state, to still less SWS and REM sleep and more time spent in stage 2. The basic NREM-REM cycle of sleep, i.e. the regular alternation between non-REM- and REM-periods, could still be distinguished, however, and showed similar average temporal characteristics as in healthy old and younger people. Similarly, although sleep was severely fragmented in most patients and many sleep episodes occurred during the day, the day-night alternation of wakefulness and sleep was maintained in the sample as a whole.","Age-related hearing difficulties can include problems with signal audibility and central auditory processing.

- Label: **Unchanged**
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" continues to refer to a clinical or medical condition related to cognitive impairments and neurological decline. Text A emphasizes the effects of dementia on sleep patterns in patients, focusing particularly on the characteristics of sleep observed in these individuals. Text B, although it broadens the scope by connecting dementia with factors like hearing difficulties and central auditory processing, retains the underlying perception of dementia as a deteriorative condition affecting various faculties. No change in meaning but rather an expansion in understanding of the factors associated with dementia is evidenced. Thus, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged""."
75,Dementia,"Graphite furnace atomic-absorption spectroscopy was used to measure aluminum concentrations in brain samples from 33 patients dying from a variety of neurologic diseases. Four samples from patients dying of nonneurologic causes also were studied. Nine samples (one from each of nine patients) of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brain contained normal amounts of aluminum. Aluminum was increased in 9 of 18 brain specimens with seven different pathologic processes. This included three of seven Alzheimer disease, two of three Huntington disease, two of two Parkinson disease, one of one progressive supranuclear palsy, one of one acoustic neuroma, one of two cerebrovascular disease, and one of two Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Aluminum was normal in the remaining samples (four normal, two ALS, one multiple sclerosis, one Pick disease, and two Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia). The significance of high aluminum values is not clear, but the normal values from the Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases imply that neuronal destruction per se need not lead to accumulation of aluminum in the brain.",The diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is challenging during the predementia stage when symptoms are subtle and confounding. Morphological and functional neuroimaging can be particularly helpful during this stage but few data are available.,"### Label: Changed

### Reason: 
In Text A, the term ""dementia"" appears in a study context where its primary focus is exploring a potential link between aluminum levels in the brain and various neurological diseases, including different forms of dementia as cited in the list of diseases examined. The usage of the word ""dementia"" here is strictly listed as one of the neurological conditions hypothesized to possibly correlate with aluminum levels, and the context does not deeply explore the behavioral or cognitive characteristics of dementia itself.

In Text B, ""dementia"" is detailed specifically in the phrase ""behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)"" and concentrates on the challenges of early diagnosis during pre-dementia stages along with methodological approaches such as neuroimaging for identifying the condition. The focus here is on characterizing the condition via its symptomatic stages and medical diagnosis strategies.

The semantic drift is apparent as the usage of ""dementia"" expands from being a generic term included in a list of many neurological conditions (Text A) to a more focused, medically detailed examination of its stages and diagnostic complexities (Text B). While both texts relate to medical contexts, Text B provides a focused exploration on nuanced implications and early detection aspects of dementia, specifically bvFTD, which show a deeper understanding and evolution in the clinical approach to dementia over time."
76,Dementia,"The diagnosis of dialysis dementia was confirmed in 150 patients treated in sixty-five dialysis centres in Europe in 1976 and 1977. The prevalence was approximately 600 per 100,000 European dialysis patients. The illness was confined to certain geographical areas, 90 of the patients being treated in only fifteen centres. It occurred more frequently in patients dialysed with unprocessed and softened water than in those treated with water processed by deionisation or reverse osmosis. Two-thirds of the patients had osteodystrophy, often painful and fracturing. Morbidity was severe and progressive and only 23 patients were still alive in 1978. The condition seems to be due to aluminium toxicity and should be preventable by water processing in centres where water aluminium content is raised.","Assessment of daily living activities is essential in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Most current tools quantitatively assess overall ability but provide little qualitative information on individual difficulties. Only a few tools allow therapists to evaluate stereotyped activities and record different types of errors. We capitalised on the Kitchen Activity Assessment to design a widely applicable analysis grid that provides both qualitative and quantitative data on activity performance. A cooking activity was videotaped in 15 patients with dementia and assessed according to the different steps in the execution of the task. The evaluations obtained with our grid showed good correlations between raters, between versions of the grid and between sessions. Moreover, the degree of independence obtained with our analysis of the task correlated with the Kitchen Activity Assessment score and with a global score of cognitive functioning. We conclude that assessment of a daily living activity with this analysis grid is reproducible and relatively independent of the therapist, and thus provides quantitative and qualitative information useful for both evaluating and caring for demented patients.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dementia"" specifically refers to a condition known as ""dialysis dementia,"" which is described as a severe and progressive morbidity due to aluminum toxicity, largely related to a particular treatment context and geographical factors affecting dialysis patients. This presents a very narrow, clinical, and context-specific meaning of dementia linked directly to dialysis practices.

  In contrast, Text B discusses ""dementia"" in a broader sense, specifically related to Alzheimer's disease, and focuses on the challenges in daily living activities faced by these patients. The use of the term here is aligned with a more general understanding of dementia as a decline in cognitive function that affects daily living and not exclusively tied to a specific cause such as dialysis. This representation aligns with the modern generic view of dementia as involving multiple cognitive impairments, including memory and executive function, which are not necessarily linked to specific external causes like aluminum exposure.

  Therefore, the term ""dementia"" has undergone a significant shift in meaning and application from a specific clinical syndrome associated with dialysis to a broader, more generalized condition impacting cognitive functions in various contexts, especially related to age and neurological diseases like Alzheimer's. This represents a clear case of semantic drift from a very specific to a more generalized and inclusive understanding of the term."
77,Dementia,"Ligand binding to alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic, serotonin, benzodiazepine and GABA receptors was studied in neocortex and hippocampus of controls and patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer-type. A selective loss of serotonergic binding sites characterised as a loss of both S1 and S2 sites was observed. The reduction in serotonin receptors did not correlate with a clinical assessment of the degree of dementia, or with the extent of Alzheimer-type neuropathological change.","The diagnosis of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) can be challenging. At present there is a paucity of prospective work addressing the specificity of current diagnostic criteria for bvFTD with respect to long-term outcome (i.e., false positives versus true positives).","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dementia"" is specifically associated with the neurological and biochemical research findings in Alzheimer's disease, focusing mainly on the biological and receptor-level changes in the brain. Here, dementia is clearly linked with Alzheimer's type specifically indicating a loss of brain functionalities due to alterations in specific receptor sites.

In contrast, Text B discusses ""dementia"" in the context of a specific subtype, which is behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The emphasis here is on diagnostics challenges and criteria related to the behavioral symptoms and long-term outcomes of this particular form of dementia, rather than on biochemical changes. The usage in Text B addresses a broader, clinically oriented perspective focusing on behavioral symptoms and diagnostic criteria rather than solely biochemical markers.

This shift from a narrowly focused biochemical and pathological understanding in Text A to a broader clinical and diagnostic focus in Text B, including emphasis on behavioral symptoms and different subtypes, indicates a semantic drift in the usage and context of the word ""dementia"" over the periods covered by the two texts."
78,Dementia,"Although metabolically active compounds sometime attenuate cognitive deficits of dementia patients, this mechanism has not been discussed or investigated. We hypothesized that these compounds improve cognitive disorders not by directly acting on this cognitive function, but by increasing the arousal level. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the change of arousal levels and the improvement of intellectual functions in 10 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) and 10 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) before and 3 months after pharmacotherapy using bifemelane hydrochloride. For each patient, a psychological test battery was carried out and the arousal level was evaluated using the frequency of rapid eye movements in the electro-oculogram (EOG) and the frequency analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) before and after the treatment. Evaluation of the cognitive improvement was made and eight out of the 20 patients were regarded as responders to the treatment. The frequency of small rapid eye movements (SREM) in the EOG increased significantly only in responders and the rate of change in SREM appearance in responders was significantly different from that in non-responders. This finding suggests that a part of the intellectual improvement in ATD and MID results from the increased level of arousal.","We evaluated the degree to which contextual isolation in nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is associated with documented pain using the Minimum Data Set 3.0, a comprehensive resident assessment required of all nursing home residents in the United States. Contextual isolation was defined as having a socially salient characteristic (demographics, habits and interests, and clinical and care dimensions) shared by fewer than 20% of other residents in the same nursing home. Thirteen percent were contextually isolated on multiple characteristics. Among residents self-reporting pain, residents contextually isolated with respect to multiple characteristics were 8% more likely (95% confidence interval: 7% to 9%) to have pain relative to residents who were not contextually isolated on any characteristics. Long-stay nursing home residents with ADRD who live in settings where they were contextually isolated were more likely to have pain relative to those without contextually isolation on any characteristic.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" is used within the medical context to describe patients with cognitive impairments primarily associated with Alzheimer's disease and other related conditions like multi-infarct dementia. Text A discusses treatments aimed at improving the cognitive deficits in dementia patients, particularly focusing on arousal levels influencing cognitive functions. Text B explores the effects of social isolation on Alzheimer's disease patients and other dementia-related conditions in nursing homes, revealing the physical and emotional impacts on individuals with dementia. Both texts maintain the term ""dementia"" as a clinical diagnosis denoting significant cognitive decline that interferes with daily functioning, reflecting no significant shift in the usage of the term between the two periods. Thus, the semantic meaning remains consistent and focused on the aspects of cognitive health, pathology, and documented instances of cognitive challenges making the label as ""Unchanged""."
79,Dementia,"Alzheimer's disease is increasingly seen as an heterogeneous disorder with a variety of molecular pathologies converging on a final common pathway of abnormal amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation. These result in the appearance of the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and in the subsequent development of a cortical dementia with a prominent memory deficit, reflecting the regional distribution of pathology. Age and mode of onset, additional neurological features and family history have all been used as a basis for classification. A family history has proved most robust with the identification of three genetic loci associated with autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Genetically defined pedigrees are important for exploring the relationships between specific molecular pathology and clinical phenotype and, by following at risk individuals, identifying the earliest features.","Psychotropic medication is commonly used among people with dementia (PWD), but it shows modest efficacy and it has been associated with severe adverse events. Hospitalizations are an opportunity for medication management as well as treatment recommendations for outpatient physicians. The aim of this study was to asses factors associated with new use of psychotropic medication after hospitalization among PWD.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" refers to a condition characterized by a decline in cognitive function, which affects activities of daily living due to disturbances in memory and other cognitive processes. In Text A, dementia is described specifically in the context of Alzheimer's disease, detailing its pathological underpinnings such as abnormal amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation leading to memory deficits. Text B discusses the treatment and management aspects concerning people with dementia (PWD), examining the use of psychotropic medication post-hospitalization. Although different aspects of dementia are highlighted (one focusing on pathogenesis and the other on management), the fundamental definition and understanding of dementia as a cognitive decline notably impacting daily functions remains consistent between both texts. Therefore, the meaning of ""dementia"" has not experienced a semantic drift and is still used in the same medical context."
80,Dementia,"The precursor of the non-amyloid beta/A4 protein (non-Abeta) component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP)/alpha-synuclein is the human homologue of alpha-synuclein, a member of a protein family which includes alpha-, beta- and gamma-synuclein. This protein is thought to be involved in neuronal plasticity because of its unique expression, mainly in the telencephalon during maturation. Consequently, disarrangement of NACP/alpha-synuclein might disrupt synaptic activity, resulting in memory disturbance. Previous studies have shown that damage to synaptic terminals is closely associated with global cognitive impairment and is an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Although the relationship between synaptic damage and amyloidogenesis is not clear, some proteins at the synaptic site have been implicated in both neuronal alteration and amyloid formation. Indeed, abnormal accumulation of both NACP/alpha-synuclein and Abeta precursor protein occurs at synapses of Alzheimer's patients. Other evidence suggests that NACP/alpha-synuclein is a component of the Lewy bodies found in patients with Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, and that a point mutation in this protein may be the cause of familial Parkinson's disease. Consequently, abnormal transport, metabolism or function of NACP/alpha-synuclein appears to impair synaptic function, which induces, at least in part, neuronal degeneration in several neurodegenerative diseases.","With respect to the diversity of age and aging, dementia poses a key challenge in our present long living society. In this respect dementia is not only a challenge for those who are diagnosed with dementia but also for their long-term caregivers. The majority of people with dementia receive care from close relatives, such as life partners in their own four walls; however, what is often a stroke of luck for the person with dementia, often means a lot of strain and spatial restrictions for the caring relative.With a praxeologically guided perspective on nursing, this article focuses on the subjective experiences of caregiving partners and examines the sociospatial challenges within this specific care situation. The empirical database is generated through qualitative interviews with 16 retired men and women from Germany (aged 64-95 years) who were analyzed considering grounded theory methodology and situational analyses. The results show that there are two specific arenas of dementia care, within which the interplay of different actors, artefacts, affects and spaces generates specific challenges that have an impact not only on the daily caring routines but also the aging of the caregiving relatives.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the usage of the word ""dementia"" is related to specific pathological changes at a cellular and molecular level, primarily discussing connections to protein accumulations and synaptic disturbances related to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The focus is on the biochemical and genetic mechanisms influencing dementia. On the other hand, Text B discusses ""dementia"" in a societal and personal context, emphasizing the social and emotional challenges faced by caregivers and patients in a home environment. Dementia here is portrayed not just as a medical condition, but as a broader societal challenge that impacts daily life and the aging of caregiving relatives. Thus, the semantic context of ""dementia"" has shifted from a strictly medical and biological focus to include significant social and existential dimensions."
81,Dementia,"This section reviews some of the more prominent alternate causes of dementia that need to be excluded when pursuing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In practice, this exclusion cannot be done with 100% precision. Consequently, the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is approximately 85%. Brain biopsy, which is seldom performed in practice, is the only method of moving diagnostic accuracy to near 100%. There is yet no intervention that halts or reverses the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, so the invasive brain biopsy is rarely justified to confirm a diagnosis.","In recent years, MRS has benefited from increased MRI field strengths, new acquisition protocols and new processing techniques. This review aims to determine how this has altered our understanding of MRS neurometabolic markers in neurodegenerative dementias.","###Answer:
- Target word: Dementia
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""dementia"" specifically refers to a condition marked by a decline in cognitive function, typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Text A discusses it in the context of the diagnostic process related primarily to Alzheimer's disease, while Text B expands on technological advancements that aid in understanding dementia through neuroimaging methods. Although the contexts differ slightly, with Text A focusing on diagnosis and Text B on technological insights, the fundamental conception of ""dementia"" as a neurodegenerative condition affecting cognitive capacities remains consistent across both texts. Thus, no significant semantic drift in the meaning of ""dementia"" appears evident between the two periods."
82,Dementia,"Using PCR and restriction digest analysis, the frequencies of the variant cytochrome P450 debrisoquine hydroxylase CYP2D6 alleles CYP2D6(A) and CYP2D6(B) were investigated in 50 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 13 patients with ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and compared to those frequencies in patients with FTD alone and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The CYP2D6(T) allelic frequency was also assessed in ALS and ALS + FTD. Although the frequency of a poor metabolizer genotype was not increased in any disease group, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the CYP2D6(B) allele in the ALS patient group. This suggests that possession of a CYP2D6(B) allele may be a risk factor for the development of ALS, possibly conferring a 'gain of function' imposed by the mutation or reflecting linkage disequilibrium to a nearby susceptibility gene.","Our aim in this study was to assess the relationship between the state of cerebral vessels and the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We included 117 MCI patients. They underwent an ultrasonographic assessment of common carotid arteries intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque index. Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia in the middle cerebral arteries was calculated with the Breath-Holding Index (BHI). After a 12-month follow-up period, neuropsychological examinations demonstrated a progression to dementia in 21 patients. Pathological values of BHI and IMT significantly increased the risk of conversion (BHI: odds ratio, 5.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-18.37, p < 0.05; IMT: odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-9.33; p < 0.05, multinomial logistic regression analysis). Comparison between patients with all normal values and those with the simultaneous alteration of the 2 vascular indexes showed an increase in the risk of conversion from 9% to 33% (ordinal regression analysis). Our findings show that alterations of cerebral vessel functional and anatomic status increase the risk of conversion from MCI to dementia.","###Answer:
- **Label:** Unchanged
- **Reason:** In both Text A and Text B, the word ""dementia"" primarily refers to a category of diseases characterized by severe memory loss, deterioration in cognitive functions, and overall decline in ability to perform everyday activities. In Text A, ""dementia"" specifically pertains to frontotemporal dementia in the context of comparing genetic alleles in various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease and ALS. In Text B, ""dementia"" is discussed within the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on predicting that progression based on vascular markers. Despite the different research focuses and specifics between the two texts, the underlying meaning and medical context in which ""dementia"" is used remains consistent, emphasizing cognitive decline related to brain function and diseases. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift in the term's usage across the two periods."
83,Dementia,This case report extends the discussion of pseudodementia into the area of manic behavior. An elderly patient whose manic symptoms are considered to be an early sign of an organic brain syndrome should be given timely repeat evaluations before this diagnosis is allowed to guide treatment. Our case presentation emphasized the paucity of the data base we have to diagnose cognitive and emotional disturbances of the elderly. It is difficult to identify the essential features of cognitive dysfunction associated with primary neuronal degeneration especially in the early stages of the disease. A careful differential diagnostic evaluation is important to eliminate variables such as affective disorders and underlying physical conditions as causes of confusion and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly patient.,"In 2008 a task force was set up to develop a revision of the European Federation of the Neurological Societies (EFNS) guideline for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other disorders associated with dementia, published in early 2007. The aim of this revised international guideline was to present a peer-reviewed evidence-based statement for the guidance of practice for clinical neurologists, geriatricians, psychiatrists, and other specialist physicians responsible for the care of patients with AD. Mild cognitive impairment and non-Alzheimer dementias are not included in this guideline.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both texts, the target word ""dementia"" is used to describe cognitive and emotional disturbances generally associated with organic brain syndromes, primarily affecting the elderly. In Text A from an earlier period, dementia is discussed in the context of distinguishing it from other conditions like affective disorders under the framework of pseudodementia. In Text B, the discussion is around setting guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders associated with dementia, focusing on a more structured approach to treating dementia. Although Text B brings in a more clinical and structured approach to handling dementia due to new guidelines and research, the underlying concept and association of the word ""dementia"" refer to conditions of significant cognitive decline typically due to neurodegeneration, which remains consistent with the usage in Text A. Thus, the core semantic meaning of the word has not shifted significantly over time."
84,Dementia,"Visual hallucinations are associated with a variety of psychiatric, medical, neurologic, and ophthalmologic disorders. One hundred forty outpatients presenting to a geriatric psychiatric clinic were screened for visual hallucinations and assessed on a number of descriptive variables, medical history, ophthalmologic history, psychiatric diagnosis, and cognitive score. The data revealed that 14 patients (10%) experienced visual hallucinations. Presence of visual hallucinations was significantly associated with diagnoses of dementia or delirium, living in a nursing home, lower cognitive score, and presence of auditory hallucinations and delusions. There was no association to number of medications, age, gender, or presence of eye disease. No patient had ""insight' into their visual hallucinations. Despite the numerous disorders that are associated with visual hallucinations, the most common causes in a geriatric psychiatry clinic are dementia and delirium. Clinicians assessing older patients with visual hallucinations should first carefully evaluate for these disorders.",Mutation in the CHMP2B gene has been implicated in frontotemporal dementia. The authors screened CHMP2B in patients with ALS and several cohorts of control samples. They identified mutations (Q206H; I29V) in two patients with non-SOD1 ALS. Neuropathology of the Q206H case showed lower motor neuron predominant disease with ubiquitylated inclusions in motor neurons. Antibodies to p62 (sequestosome 1) showed novel oligodendroglial inclusions in the motor cortex.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""dementia"" retains a similar meaning associated with neurological disorders. In Text A, dementia is mentioned in a clinical setting involving older patients with visual hallucinations, correlating the condition with cognitive impairments and related symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and delusions. Text B mentions dementia in the context of genetic research, specifically highlighting frontotemporal dementia linked to CHMP2B gene mutations. Despite different aspects of dementia being discussed—clinical symptoms in Text A and genetic factors in Text B—the core concept of dementia as a neurological, degenerative condition remains consistent between both texts. There is no evidence of significant semantic drift in the use of the word ""dementia"" over time based on these texts."
85,Dementia,"HIV-1 protein Tat is neurotoxic and increases macrophage and microglia production of TNF-alpha, a cytopathic cytokine linked to the neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia. Others have shown that intracellular calcium regulates TNF-alpha production in macrophages, and we have shown that Tat releases calcium from inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-regulated stores in neurons and astrocytes. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that Tat-induced TNF-alpha production was dependent on the release of intracellular calcium from IP3-regulated calcium stores in primary macrophages. We found that Tat transiently and dose-dependently increased levels of intracellular calcium and that this increase was blocked by xestospongin C, pertussis toxin, and by phospholipase C and type 1 protein kinase C inhibitors but not by protein kinase A or phospholipase A2 inhibitors. Xestospongin C, BAPTA-AM, U73122, and bisindolylmalemide significantly inhibited Tat-induced TNF-alpha production. These results demonstrate that in macrophages, Tat-induced release of calcium from IP3-sensitive intracellular stores and activation of nonconventional PKC isoforms play an important role in Tat-induced TNF-alpha production.",Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal conditions or for gastroprotection from other drugs. Research suggests they are linked to increased dementia risk. We use linked national health data to examine the association between PPI use and the development of incident dementia.,"###Answer:

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the word ""dementia"" refers specifically to a condition related to the neuropathogenesis of HIV, likely described as ""HIV dementia."" This form of dementia is described as being directly linked to the effects of the HIV-1 protein Tat and its interaction with neuronal processes. On the other hand, Text B uses ""dementia"" in a broader, more general context as a possible risk associated with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the general population. Here, ""dementia"" is not linked to a specific disease such as HIV but is discussed as a potential broader medical condition that might be induced or worsened by certain medications in diverse populations. This shift from a very specific medical condition linked to a particular virus to a general risk factor possibly associated with a common class of drugs shows a significant change in the connotation and application of the term ""dementia"" over time."
86,Dementia,"LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus infection causes an AIDS-like syndrome--murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--in C57B1/6 mice and impairs spatial learning in the Morris water maze without gross motor impairment. We used a shuttle shock-avoidance procedure to examine the effects of LP-BM5 infection on learning and retention of avoidance behavior. Thirty mice were inoculated with LP-BM5; 30 received vehicle (DMEM) injections. Fifteen LP-BM5 and 15 DMEM mice were trained in avoidance 7 wk after inoculation; retention of the avoidance response was tested 4 wk later. The remaining mice were trained 11 wk after inoculation. In animals trained 7 wk after inoculation, the groups performed similarly, with a marginally significant tendency for LP-BM5-infected animals to make more avoidance responses. This group difference was significant when animals were retested at 11 wk. However, LP-BM5 animals trained 11 wk after inoculation made significantly fewer avoidance responses than controls trained at the same time. We conclude that in later stages of disease, LP-BM5 impairs response acquisition, but not performance, in the active avoidance procedure. Results extend the use of the LP-BM5-infected mouse as a model of AIDS dementia complex.","Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a group of clinical syndromes, including behavioral-variant FTD, nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, FTD motor neuron disease, progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, and corticobasal syndrome.

- Reason: The term ""dementia"" has experienced a noticeable semantic drift when comparing the two texts. In Text A, ""dementia"" is associated with an AIDS-like syndrome in mice, specifically focusing on the impairment of cognitive functions (learning and retention of avoidance behavior) due to a viral infection. The primary context is the investigation of the virus’s effects on the cognition of experimental animals, creating a narrow, pathology-oriented definition related to infection. On the other hand, Text B details ""dementia,"" particularly focusing on Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) as a complex of various clinical syndromes affecting human behavior and language skills, accompanied by detailed classifications and emphasis on its diagnosis in clinical settings. This reveals the shift from a broadly pathogenic view (in a very specific experimental setting) to a nuanced clinical and diagnostic perspective including varied subtypes and symptoms related to human psychological and neurological health. This indicates that the usage and understanding of ""dementia"" have expanded and detailed over time, emphasizing specific syndromes and clinical features."

The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of DLB are investigated in a prospective manner. Visual hallucinations, fluctuations and extrapyramidal symptoms seem to have, in association with the progressive cognitive decline, some particularities. However their specificity should be correlated with neuropathological data. Other symptoms, such as repeated falls or syncope, neuroleptic sensitivity, systematized delusions or other modalities of hallucinations, are probably additional arguments giving more predictive value to the association of the major symptoms. The role of neuropsychological patterns at the beginning of the cognitive decline is shown. There are some recent concordant results of functional imaging in DLB. The neuropathological aspects of DLB and the links with Parkinson pathology and especially Alzheimer pathology are emphasized.","Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common type of dementia causing irreversible brain damage to the elderly and presents a major public health challenge. Clinical research and genome-wide association studies have suggested a potential contribution of the endocytic pathway to AD, with an emphasis on common loci. However, the contribution of rare variants in this pathway to AD has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we focused on the effect of rare variants on AD by first applying a rare-variant gene-set burden analysis using genes in the endocytic pathway on over 3,000 individuals with European ancestry from three large whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. We identified significant associations of rare-variant burden within the endocytic pathway with AD, which were successfully replicated in independent datasets. We further demonstrated that this endocytic rare-variant enrichment is associated with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and age-related phenotypes, increasing the risk of obtaining severer brain damage, earlier age-at-onset, and earlier age-of-death. Next, by aggregating rare variants within each gene, we sought to identify single endocytic genes associated with AD and NFTs. Careful examination using NFTs revealed one significantly associated gene, ANKRD13D. To identify functional associations, we integrated bulk RNA-Seq data from over 600 brain tissues and found two endocytic expression genes (eGenes), HLA-A and SLC26A7, that displayed significant influences on their gene expressions. Differential expressions between AD patients and controls of these three identified genes were further examined by incorporating scRNA-Seq data from 48 post-mortem brain samples and demonstrated distinct expression patterns across cell types. Taken together, our results demonstrated strong rare-variant effect in the endocytic pathway on AD risk and progression and functional effect of gene expression alteration in both bulk and single-cell resolution, which may bring more insight and serve as valuable resources for future AD genetic studies, clinical research, and therapeutic targeting.","### Answer:
- **Label:** Unchanged
- **Reason:** The term ""dementia"" in both contexts pertains to the clinical and pathological aspects of cognitive decline associated with certain brain diseases. Text A discusses Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), outlining clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and neuropathology, emphasizing its connection with other pathologies like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Text B focuses on Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) and discusses genetic studies and the implications of rare genetic variants on Alzheimer's Disease, also connecting to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative pathology. In both texts, ""dementia"" retains its core meaning related to cognitive impairment, brain pathology, and associated symptomatology in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the different focuses (clinical features in Text A and genetic contributions in Text B), the fundamental meaning of dementia as a decline in cognitive functions due to brain disease remains consistent between the two periods."
89,Dementia,"1. The dynamic changes in ventricular size were computed by MRI cinecisternography. 2. The data analyzed showed that the phasic changes in size of the third ventricle and/or fourth ventricle were reduced in patients with the small multiple infarcts, with dementia, and with enlarged lateral ventricles when compared to subjects without these findings. 3. The derangement in CSF flow dynamics may be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. ",This study aims to test the feasibility of the PainChek app to assess pain for people with dementia living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). It will also identify the optimal dosage and efficacy of a social robot (personal assistant robot [PARO]) intervention on chronic pain for people with dementia.,"- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the word ""dementia"" is discussed primarily in the context of its relationship with physical brain changes and neurological impairments, such as ventricular size and CSF flow dynamics, closely associating it with vascular causes and cerebral pathology. Here, dementia is perceived primarily as a neurological and pathophysiological condition that is quantitatively measured through MRI and similar medical assessments. In Text B, however, ""dementia"" is referred to in a context emphasizing the application of technology and interventions to improve the quality of life for individuals with dementia, focusing on assessments and interventions for associated conditions like pain in residential care settings. This indicates a broader, more holistic approach to understanding and managing dementia, not just as a medical or neurological issue but also addressing emotional and social aspects. Thus, the semantic field around ""dementia"" has broadened to include interdisciplinary approaches and patient-centered care practices, reflecting a shift in focus from purely medical to integrative care aspects."
90,Dementia,"We have previously demonstrated that a plasma natriuretic factor is present in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but not in multi-infarct dementia (MID) or normal controls (C). We postulated that the natriuretic factor might induce the increased cytosolic calcium reported in AD by inhibiting the sodium-calcium antiporter, thereby activating the apoptotic pathway. To test for a factor in AD plasma that induces apoptosis, we exposed nonconfluent cultured LLC-PK1 cells to plasma from AD, MID, and C for 2 h and performed a terminal transferase-dUTP-nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The plasma from AD increased apoptosis nearly fourfold compared with MID and C. The effect was dose dependent and the peak effect was attained after a 2-h exposure. Additionally, apoptotic morphology was detected by electron microscopy, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage was found. We inhibited apoptosis by removing calcium from the medium, inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide, alternately boiling or freezing and thawing the plasma, and digesting a partially purified fraction with trypsin. Heating AD plasma to 56 degrees C did not deactivate the apoptotic factor. These results demonstrate the presence of an apoptotic factor in the plasma of patients with AD.","Depression is a multicausal disorder and has been associated with the risk to develop cancer, dementia, diabetes, epilepsy and stroke. As a metabolic disorder depression has been associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin sensitivity, neuropeptide Y, glucose regulation, poor glycemic control, glucagone-like peptide-1, cholezystokinin, ghrelin, leptin, the endocannabinoid system, insulin-like growth factor and gastrin-releasing peptide. As a cardiovascular disease a close relationship exists between depression and blood pressure, heart rate, norepinephrine, sympathetic tone, vascular resistance, blood viscosity, plasma volume, intima thickness and atherosclerosis. Additionally blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, D-dimers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein, platelet activation, VEGF, plasma nitric oxide and its synthase are changed in depressed patients. As an endocrinological and stress disorder depression has been connected with the concentration of free T4, TSH, CRH, arginine vasopressin, corticotrophin, corticosteroid release and ACTH. Depression as an inflammatory disorder is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, TNF-alpha, soluble interleukin-2 receptors, interferon-alpha, interleukin 8, interleukin-10, hs-CRP, acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, toll like receptor 4, interleukin-1beta, mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, substance P, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin-E2, lipid peroxidation levels and acid sphingomyelinase. Nutritional factors might influence depression risk, i.e. the consumption of folate, omega-3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. The neurodegenerative hypothesis of depression explains decreased hippocampal volumes in depressed patients and changes of neurotrophic support by BDNF, erythropoietin, GDNF, FGF-2, NT3, NGF and growth hormone. In this context, a fast neuroprotective and antidepressant effect has also been observed by ketamine, which acts via the glutamatergic system. Hence, GABA, AMPA, EAAT, NMDA- and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 to mGluR8) have gained interest in depression recently. Alternative, causative or also easy available treatment strategies beyond serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition might be a major topic of future psychiatric care. In this review, an attempt is made to overview concepts of the disease and search for perspectives on antidepressant treatment strategies beyond approved medications. ","###Answer:
- Target word: **Dementia**
- Text A: Focuses on a specific biochemical aspect of dementia related to Alzheimer's disease, discussing an apoptotic factor present in the plasma of AD but not in other types such as multi-infarct dementia or normal controls. It delves into the detailed biochemical processes involved in Alzheimer's as contrasted with other forms of dementia, chiefly using a scientific and medical perspective.
- Text B: Broadens the conversation around dementia to discuss it as a risk factor associated with depression. Here, dementia is lumped together with other diseases like cancer, diabetes, and stroke, portraying it more as one of several possible comorbid conditions rather than focusing on its particularities as seen in Text A.

- Label: **Changed**
- Reason: The meaning and connotation of ""dementia"" in Text A is tightly related to its biochemical and medical dynamics, specifically within the context of Alzheimer's disease. In Text B, while still recognized as a medical condition, ""dementia"" is treated more broadly as part of a list of conditions associated with another disorder (depression), without the specific biochemical focus. This shift from a detailed, disease-specific perspective to being grouped as one among many co-morbidities associated with depression suggests a change in the context and usage of the word over time."

However, the structural changes in NOTCH3 involved in CADASIL etiology are unclear. Here, we discovered site-specific fragmentation of NOTCH3 protein in pathologically affected vessels of human CADASIL-affected brains. EM-based experiments to pinpoint NOTCH3 localization in these brains indicated accumulation of NOTCH3 fragmentation products in the basement membrane, collagen fibers, and granular osmiophilic material within the cerebrovasculature. Using antibodies generated against a disease-linked neo-epitope found in degenerating vascular medium of CADASIL brains, we mapped the site of fragmentation to the NOTCH3 N terminus at the peptide bond joining Asp","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The target word ""dementia"" in both Text A and Text B refers to a cognitive decline that is characteristic of diseases like Alzheimer's disease and CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). In Text A, ""dementia"" is associated with its effects on cerebral glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease patients. Similarly, in Text B, ""dementia"" is discussed as one of the symptoms arising from NOTCH3 gene mutations leading to CADASIL, impacting vascular smooth muscle cell degeneration and stroke. In both contexts, the term is used to reference a severe impairment in mental functioning linked to neurological or brain disease, demonstrating no significant change in meaning or connotation over the different texto periods."
92,Dementia,"To examine the clinicopathological correlations in rare Alzheimer's disease patients with asymmetric cerebral atrophy and to compare their pattern of cortical involvement by senile lesions with that observed in other cases with atypical Alzheimer's disease, we performed an extensive neuropathological analysis of the cerebral cortex in four such cases. Three patients presented with severe language impairment but relatively good preservation of praxis and gnosis even after several years of clinical evolution. Cerebral autopsies of these cases revealed a predominant left hemisphere atrophy. Conversely, in one case with marked right hemisphere atrophy, all of the cognitive functions were involved early in the course of dementia. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques were preferentially localized in the prefrontal, temporal and posterior parietal cortex in both hemispheres, whereas the hippocampal formation displayed lower lesion densities than neocortical areas. Significantly higher neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque densities were found in the more atrophic side in most of the areas studied. The ratio of neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque densities between the two hemispheres was not correlated with the number of these lesions in the cerebral cortex. These results indicate that the degenerative process in demented cases with interhemispheric asymmetric cerebral atrophy is characterized by a widespread involvement of the neocortex by senile lesions and lacks clear regional topography of neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque distribution. Moreover, the relative sparing of the hippocampus, comparable to that found in cases with focal progressive dementia, suggests that the dementing process may involve different cortical structures in cases with asymmetric cerebral atrophy than in typical Alzheimer's disease cases.","Pain is one of the most frequent symptoms in older adults. It severely impairs quality of life, increases delirium risk, and may lead to progression of dementia. Assessment of pain performed by taking anamnesis from the patient is not reliable in patients with dementia due to cooperation and communication problems. The aim of this study was to assess pain and its consequences in patients with dementia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the word ""dementia"" refers consistently to a condition involving cognitive and functional impairments. Text A discusses dementia in the context of neuropathological analysis, detailing how it affects different brain regions in Alzheimer's disease patients. Text B talks about dementia in relation to its impact on pain assessment and quality of life in older patients. While the specifics of the study and the focus areas are different, the fundamental concept of ""dementia"" as a cognitive and functional impairment remains consistent between the two texts. There is no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of the word ""dementia"" between the two periods."
93,Dementia,"Despite the usual focus on daily costs, because PWAs have higher costs per day than other SNF residents, LOS and days of care are important cost indices. Data on LOS for 102 admissions and annual days of care for 90 PWAs show average 64-day LOS and 67 days of care. Regression analysis and survival analysis show dementias and IV drug use to mean longer LOS and more days of care. Higher PWA costs must be sustained over longer periods for PWAs with dementias and for IV drug users, who may claim increasing shares of the SNF care provided to PWAs.","The small house model of elder care emphasizes deinstitutionalization as a strategy to reduce the negative outcomes associated with nursing home care. The small house changes the philosophy, architecture, and organizational design of the institution and has been associated with higher quality of life and good quality of care.

Initial research has been conducted, and additional research is underway to determine whether the outcomes match the intentions.","### Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of ""dementia"" refers to cognitive impairments usually observed in older patients, particularly in the context of care facilities, but the focus is a bit different. Text A discusses dementia in the context of its impact on length of stay and costs associated with care in skilled nursing facilities, thereby addressing operational and economic aspects of care for patients with dementia. Text B, meanwhile, shifts the focus slightly to discuss the qualitative aspects of care under a different model (the small house model), which seeks to improve the quality of life and care for individuals with dementia. Despite the different angles, the fundamental meaning of the word ""dementia"" as a cognitive disorder affecting elderly populations remains consistent across both periods, without a significant shift in underlying definition or connotation. Thus, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
94,Dementia,"Circadian rhythm disturbances are frequently present in Alzheimer disease (AD). In the present study, we investigated the expression of vasopressin (AVP) mRNA in the human suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The in situ hybridization procedure on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material was improved to such a degree that we could, for the first time, visualize AVP mRNA expressing neurons in the human SCN and carry out quantitative measurements. The total amount of AVP mRNA expressed as masked silver grains in the SCN was 3 times lower in AD patients (n = 14; 2,135 +/- 597 microm2) than in age- and time-of-death-matched controls (n = 11; 6,667 +/- 1466 microm2) (p = 0.003). No significant difference was found in the amount of AVP mRNA between AD patients with depression (n = 7) and without depression (n = 7) (2,985 +/-1103 microm2 and 1,285 +/- 298 microm2, respectively; p = 0.38). In addition, the human SCN AVP mRNA expressing neurons showed a marked day-night difference in controls under 80 years of age. The amount of AVP mRNA was more than 3 times higher during the daytime (9,028 +/- 1709 microm2, n = 7) than at night (2,536 +/- 740 microm2, n = 4; p = 0.02), whereas no clear diurnal rhythm of AVP mRNA in the SCN was observed in AD patients. There was no relationship between the amount of AVP mRNA in the SCN and age at onset of dementia, duration of AD and the neuropathological changes in the cerebral cortex. These findings suggest that the neurobiological basis of the circadian rhythm disturbances that are responsible for behavioral rhythm disorders is located in the SCN. It also explains the beneficial effects of light therapy on nightly restlessness in AD patients.","The European Association for Palliative Care White Paper defined optimal palliative care in dementia based on evidence and expert consensus. Yet, we know little on how to achieve this for people with dementia living and dying at home.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In examining the text passages where the target word ""dementia"" is used, we observe that the essential meaning has remained consistent across the two periods. In both Text A and Text B, ""dementia"" refers to a clinical syndrome characterized by cognitive impairment, typically witnessed in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease as described in Text A or discussed in the context of palliative care as in Text B. Text A focuses on a specific study related to Alzheimer's patients and their circadian rhythms, detailing a component of dementia research, while Text B discusses broader care approaches for individuals with dementia. In both cases, ""dementia"" references a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning, without shifting to any distinct new meanings over time. Thus, the core meaning of the term remains stable, referring to the medical condition involving cognitive decline."
95,Dementia,"Three cases of elderly, institutionalised patients with problems relating to dementia and agitation and good response to homeopathic treatment are presented.","We describe the use of dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) to identify ligands for the stem-loop structure located at the exon 10-5'-intron junction of Tau pre-mRNA, which is involved in the onset of several tauopathies including frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). A series of ligands that combine the small aminoglycoside neamine and heteroaromatic moieties (azaquinolone and two acridines) have been identified by using DCC. These compounds effectively bind the stem-loop RNA target (the concentration required for 50% RNA response (EC(50)): 2-58 μM), as determined by fluorescence titration experiments. Importantly, most of them are able to stabilize both the wild-type and the +3 and +14 mutated sequences associated with the development of FTDP-17 without producing a significant change in the overall structure of the RNA (as analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy), which is a key factor for recognition by the splicing regulatory machinery. A good correlation has been found between the affinity of the ligands for the target and their ability to stabilize the RNA secondary structure.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the usage of ""dementia"" refers to a general clinical and social condition related to elderly patients exhibiting behavioral and cognitive disturbances, emphasizing the health and care aspect of those suffering from dementia. It presents an understanding of dementia as relatively limited to symptoms related to cognitive decline and behavioral issues in a social and medical care setting.

In contrast, Text B utilizes ""dementia"" specifically in the context of a sub-type of dementia known as frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). The focus here is significantly more biochemical and genetic, discussing the molecular interactions at the genetic level that contribute to this subtype of dementia. The mention of the stem-loop structure of RNA and the specifics of ligand binding highlights the advances in understanding the biochemical mechanisms at play, a perspective that significantly extends beyond the traditional view of dementia as merely a decline in cognitive function.

This significant shift from a general medical and care perspective to a more detailed molecular and genetic perspective indicates a broadening and deepening of the concept of dementia, showing a clear semantic drift in how the term is used and understood over time."
96,Dementia,"The effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal pallidum (GPi) on the parkinsonian triad and on levodopa-induced dyskinesias are very similar. The antiakinetic effect of STN DBS seems to be slightly better. On the contrary to pallidal DBS, stimulation of the STN allows to reduce dopaminergic treatment by more than 50 p. 100 on average. Moreover, the current drain is smaller in STN. Thus, the STN is a low budget target compared to the GPi. STN DBS seems to be as effective on PD tremor as stimulation of the classic thalamic target, the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim), whereas Vim stimulation has no effect on akinesia and very little on levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Thus, the STN has become the main target nucleus for DBS in PD, which is most often performed bilaterally in one surgical procedure. There is a good correlation of the preoperative response to levodopa and postoperative effects of bilateral STN DBS and this defines the patient population. Given the large patient population, simple guidelines for patient selection are developed. The referring physician can preselect patients based mainly on age (less than 70), absence of dementia and presence of severe disability related to motor fluctuations or dyskinesias. It is the responsibility of the operating centre to determine the levodopa response, to confirm the diagnosis, to rule out contraindications and to make sure that the medical treatment cannot be further optimised. Severe surgical complications with permanent sequels are relatively rare, about 1 p. 100 per implanted side. The patient selection, the precision of the surgery and the quality of the postoperative follow-up are the three main determinants of success.","Estimating the fraction of dementia cases in a population attributable to a risk factor or combination of risk factors (the population attributable fraction (PAF)) informs the design and choice of dementia risk-reduction activities. It is directly relevant to dementia prevention policy and practice. Current methods employed widely in the dementia literature to combine PAFs for multiple dementia risk factors assume a multiplicative relationship between factors and rely on subjective criteria to develop weightings for risk factors. In this paper we present an alternative approach to calculating the PAF based on sums of individual risk. It incorporates individual risk factor interrelationships and enables a range of assumptions about the way in which multiple risk factors will combine to affect dementia risk. Applying this method to global data demonstrates that the previous estimate of 40% is potentially too conservative an estimate of modifiable dementia risk and would necessitate subadditive interaction between risk factors. We calculate a plausible conservative estimate of 55.7% (95% confidence interval: 55.2, 56.1) based on additive risk factor interaction.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the word ""dementia"" refers specifically to a condition that patients must not have in order to be selected for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson's disease. It is mentioned in the context of patient screening criteria, implying that dementia in this context is primarily viewed as a disqualifying medical condition for a specific treatment. In contrast, Text B discusses ""dementia"" more broadly as a health condition to be understood and prevented at a population level. This text explores the epidemiological calculation of the risk factors contributing to the prevalence of dementia, focusing on prevention and public health policy. The semantic use of ""dementia"" has drifted from a specific clinical exclusion criterion to a broader focus on population health, prevention, and policy in addressing the disorder's risk factors. This indicates a shift in perspective and application from direct clinical treatment contexts to broader public health and preventive approaches."

- Reason: The term ""dementia"" across both texts consistently refers to a decline in cognitive function associated with brain disease or impairment. In Text A, ""dementia"" is used to describe the clinical manifestation in a patient suffering from cerebral mycosis fungoides and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, indicating a cognitive decline linked to these brain conditions. In Text B, ""dementia"" is addressed in the context of aging populations, discussing the evaluation of cognitive status to assess risks of dementia, maintaining the focus on cognitive decline or impairment. Although the contexts of the discussions are different—with Text A focusing on a case study and Text B on a more generalized study of dementia in a population—the fundamental meaning of the term ""dementia"" as a decline in cognitive abilities due to brain impairment remains consistent between the two periods."
98,Dementia,"Antiviral medications have been useful in delaying the time course of HIV infection. Antiviral medications have also been reported to delay or reduce symptoms associated with AIDS related dementia and to improve cortical perfusion. The mechanism for this improvement is unclear. Thus, this report studies the effects of antiviral medications on cerebral blood flow velocity in HIV+ cocaine abusers, HIV+ control individuals and appropriate control individuals. Thirty-two unmedicated HIV+ individuals (28 cocaine abusers and 4 control individuals), 22 HIV+ individuals using antiviral medications (16 cocaine abusers and 6 HIV+ control individuals), 47 HIV- cocaine abusers, and 27 control HIV- subjects were studied. Blood flow velocities were determined for the anterior and middle cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler sonography. HIV+ individuals on antiviral medications had lower pulsatility values, suggesting decreased resistance in the cerebral blood vessels, in comparison to HIV+ individuals not taking antiviral medications. HIV+ cocaine abusers and HIV+ control individuals using antiviral medications had pulsatility values similar to HIV- control subjects. Antiviral medications appear to reduce these cerebrovascular perfusion deficits in HIV+ individuals. The antiviral medications appear to have a direct neuroprotective effect in addition to their antiviral effects. The neuroprotective role of antiviral medications requires further investigation.","Hoarding can be a symptom of multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Recent evidence suggests that, in many cases, hoarding can also be a standalone problem that presents independently from other conditions; this has led to the proposal of a new diagnostic entity named hoarding disorder. This article reviews the neuropsychological and neuroimaging research on pathological hoarding. Most research in humans has been conducted in the context of individuals with brain damage, dementia, or OCD. Studies of well-characterized samples of individuals with hoarding disorder are extremely rare. Although not possible to establish firm conclusions at this stage, we conclude with a series of observations and recommendations for clinical practice.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: The term ""dementia"" has apparently experienced a semantic shift from predominantly referring to a symptom associated with neuropsychiatric conditions (as seen in the context of AIDS in Text A from an earlier period) to being considered more broadly in connection with a spectrum of disorders, including hoarding disorder in a more recent discussion (Text B). In Text A, ""dementia"" is discussed specifically as a symptom secondary to AIDS, focusing on its physiological aspects and management. In contrast, Text B's discussion of ""dementia"" broadens its application, implicitly linking it to broader neuropsychiatric conditions beyond a mere symptom, indicating a drift in how the term is understood in medical and clinical contexts over time."
99,Dementia,"Neuropathology studies show that patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease typically have lesions of the entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (Hip), and temporal neocortex. Related observations with in vivo imaging have enabled the prediction of dementia from MCI. Although individuals with normal cognition may have focal EC lesions, this anatomy has not been studied as a predictor of cognitive decline and brain change. The objective of this MRI-guided 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose/positron-emission tomography (FDG/PET) study was to examine the hypothesis that among normal elderly subjects, EC METglu reductions predict decline and the involvement of the Hip and neocortex. In a 3-year longitudinal study of 48 healthy normal elderly, 12 individuals (mean age 72) demonstrated cognitive decline (11 to MCI and 1 to Alzheimer's disease). Nondeclining controls were matched on apolipoprotein E genotype, age, education, and gender. At baseline, metabolic reductions in the EC accurately predicted the conversion from normal to MCI. Among those who declined, the baseline EC predicted longitudinal memory and temporal neocortex metabolic reductions. At follow-up, those who declined showed memory impairment and hypometabolism in temporal lobe neocortex and Hip. Among those subjects who declined, apolipoprotein E E4 carriers showed marked longitudinal temporal neocortex reductions. In summary, these data suggest that an EC stage of brain involvement can be detected in normal elderly that predicts future cognitive and brain metabolism reductions. Progressive E4-related hypometabolism may underlie the known increased susceptibility for dementia. Further study is required to estimate individual risks and to determine the physiologic basis for METglu changes detected while cognition is normal.","Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is often characterized by pronounced impairment in visuospatial skills, attention, and executive functions. However, the strength of the phenotypic expression of DLB varies and may be weaker in patients with extensive concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine whether strength of the DLB clinical phenotype impacts cognitive decline, visuospatial and language tests were retrospectively used to predict 2-year rate of global cognitive decline in 22 autopsy-confirmed DLB patients (21 with concomitant AD) and 44 autopsy-confirmed ""pure"" AD patients. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) revealed a significant interaction such that poor baseline performances on tests of visuospatial skills were strongly associated with a rapid rate of cognitive decline in DLB but not AD (p < .001). No effect of confrontation naming was found. DLB patients with poor visuospatial skills had fewer neurofibrillary tangles and were more likely to experience visual hallucinations than those with better visuospatial skills. These results suggest that the severity of visuospatial deficits in DLB may identify those facing a particularly malignant disease course and may designate individuals whose clinical syndrome is impacted more by Lewy body formation than AD pathology.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""dementia"" is fundamentally associated with cognitive decline specifically concerning Alzheimer's disease and is discussed in the context of predicting the shift from mild cognitive impairment to more pronounced cognitive issues using biomarkers. Similarly, Text B also discusses dementia, particularly focusing on ""Dementia with Lewy bodies,"" highlighting the cognitive decline through visuospatial impairments and executive dysfunction. In both contexts, ""dementia"" maintains its primary association with a degenerative condition characterized by a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life, despite slight adjustments in the specifics of the types of dementia discussed (Alzheimer's vs. Lewy bodies). The fundamental meaning of dementia as a significant cognitive decline due to brain disease remains consistent across both texts."
0,Schizophrenia,"Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is a congenital disorder characterised by multiple dysmorphisms, cleft palate, cardiac anomalies, and learning disabilities due to a microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2. Although VCFS is often associated with psychiatric symptoms, its prevalence among psychiatric patients is unknown. A total of 326 patients admitted in September and October 1997 to a Japanese psychiatric hospital were screened for the clinical features of VCFS. Twelve patients with minor facial dysmorphia were identified; chromosomal analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed in six patients who, further assessment suggested, were most likely to have VCFS. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion was identified in a 41 year old woman who had symptoms of schizophrenia but no major dysmorphia, such as cardiovascular anomalies and cleft palate. Her behavioural and neuropsychological profiles were similar to those previously reported in VCFS. She was hemizygous for the FISH probe N25 (GDB locus D22S75) and also for probes N72H9 (D22S181), sc11.1a, C443 (D22S941), sc4.1 (D22S134), sc11.1b, N19B3 (D22S264), N122B5 (D22S934), and N77F7 (D22S939). The size of the deletion was about 3 Mb. Our patient had only some features of VCFS including a square nasal root, hypernasal speech, and hypoparathyroidism. She did, however, have the common larger deletion of type A. This finding suggests that psychiatric symptoms in VCFS can occur without major developmental symptoms such as cardiovascular anomalies and cleft palate. Additional patients with schizophrenia may have subtle features of VCFS which are unrecognised on routine medical examinations.","Identification of imaging biomarkers for schizophrenia is an important but still challenging problem. Even though considerable efforts have been made over the past decades, quantitative alterations between patients and healthy subjects have not yet provided a diagnostic measure with sufficient high sensitivity and specificity. One of the most important reasons is the lack of consistent findings, which is in part due to single-mode study, which only detects single dimensional information by each modality, and thus misses the most crucial differences between groups. Here, we hypothesize that multimodal integration of functional MRI (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) might yield more power for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. A novel multivariate data fusion method for combining these modalities is introduced without reducing the dimension or using the priors from 161 schizophrenia patients and 168 matched healthy controls. The multi-index feature for each ROI is constructed and summarized with Wilk's lambda by performing multivariate analysis of variance to calculate the significant difference between different groups. Our results show that, among these modalities, fMRI has the most significant featureby calculating the Jaccard similarity coefficient (0.7416) and Kappa index (0.4833). Furthermore, fusion of these modalities provides the most plentiful information and the highest predictive accuracy of 86.52%. This work indicates that multimodal integration can improve the ability of distinguishing differences between groups and might be assisting in further diagnosis of schizophrenia.","###Label:

###Reason:
The core meaning and context in which ""schizophrenia"" is used in both Text A and Text B remain consistent, referring to the psychiatric disorder itself and aspects of its diagnosis or symptoms. In Text A, schizophrenia is discussed in the context of a patient's symptoms and a possible genetic association (VCFS syndrome), emphasizing its psychiatric manifestations and the complex nature of its diagnosis. In Text B, the focus is more technical, dealing with the innovative diagnostic methodologies using imaging technologies to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but still fundamentally addressing the disorder itself. Both texts emphasize the complexity and multi-faceted nature of diagnosing and understanding schizophrenia without deviating from its established psychiatric definition."
1,Schizophrenia,"HLA antigens were typed among 136 Japanese schizophrenics. Increased frequencies were seen in A9 (Aw24), A10 (A26) and Bw54, and decreased frequency in B40 antigens when compared to 187 Japanese controls. It is suggested that there may be an association between A9 (Aw24) and schizophrenia with a chronic-progressive course and also an association between A10 (A26) and hebephrenia.","Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an example of sensorimotor gating and deficits in PPI have been demonstrated in schizophrenia patients. Phencyclidine (PCP) suppression of PPI in animals has been studied to elucidate the pathological elements of schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PCP treatment or PPI in the brain are still poorly understood. In this study, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed on the prefrontal cortex from rats that were subjected to PPI after being systemically injected with PCP or saline. PCP downregulated phosphorylation events were significantly enriched in proteins associated with long-term potentiation (LTP). Importantly, this data set identifies functionally novel phosphorylation sites on known LTP-associated signaling molecules. In addition, mutagenesis of a significantly altered phosphorylation site on xCT (SLC7A11), the light chain of system xc-, the cystine/glutamate antiporter, suggests that PCP also regulates the activity of this protein. Finally, new insights were also derived on PPI signaling independent of PCP treatment. This is the first quantitative phosphorylation proteomic analysis providing new molecular insights into sensorimotor gating. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
Both Text A and Text B explore the biological and neurological aspects of schizophrenia, though from different angles. Text A discusses the potential genetic associations with different types of schizophrenia through the study of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) among Japanese schizophrenics. This text implicitly relates the occurrence of schizophrenia to genetic markers, which might predispose individuals to the disorder. Text B investigates schizophrenia from a neurobiological perspective by studying the effect of a drug (Phencyclidine, PCP) on prepulse inhibition (PPI), an experimental paradigm used to understand sensorimotor gating deficits observed in schizophrenia patients. The focus is also on understanding molecular mechanisms potentially relevant to schizophrenia. 

In both cases, schizophrenia is viewed through the lens of underlying biological or genetic abnormalities, albeit with different methods (genetic markers versus pharmacological and proteomic studies). The primary semantic content of the term 'schizophrenia' as a complex and multifaceted psychiatric disorder remains consistent between the two texts. Despite advances in scientific methodologies and the depth of understanding, the foundational concept of schizophrenia as a disorder influenced by intricate biological mechanisms has not significantly shifted between the texts. Thus, the semantic drift for the word ""schizophrenia"" is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
2,Schizophrenia,"Nonorganic insomnia is a frequent sleep disorder that has a high comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses. In our sleep outpatient clinic, 41% of the patients showed neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, 31% affective disorders and 1.6% schizophrenia. Sleep laboratory investigations in patients for diagnostic purposes and in normal subjects for the evaluation of drug effects suggest that changes in the sleep architecture of patients with nonorganic insomnia due to psychiatric disorders, compared with normal controls, are opposite to alterations induced by psychotropic drugs intended for their treatment, compared with placebo (key-lock principle). Evidence for this principle was found regarding nonorganic insomnia related to generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorders and benzodiazepines, depressive episodes, recurrent depression or dysthymia and sedative antidepressants and finally schizophrenia and sedative neuroleptics. Polysomnography (PSG) findings of other mental disorders are rather scarce and often depend upon the subtype and stage of the disease. In conclusion, sleep laboratory studies may be helpful for choosing the right drug for an individual insomniac patient.","The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a major regulator of protein processing, trafficking, and degradation. While protein ubiquitination is utilized for many cellular processes, one major function of this system is to target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. In schizophrenia, studies have found UPS transcript abnormalities in both blood and brain, and we have previously reported decreased protein expression of ubiquitin-associated proteins in brain. To test whether the proteasome is similarly dysregulated, we measured the protein expression of proteasome catalytic subunits as well as essential subunits from proteasome regulatory complexes in 14 pair-matched schizophrenia and comparison subjects in superior temporal cortex. We found decreased expression of Rpt1, Rpt3, and Rpt6, subunits of the 19S regulatory particle essential for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome. Additionally, the α subunit of the 11S αβ regulatory particle, which enhances proteasomal degradation of small peptides and unfolded proteins, was also decreased. Haloperidol-treated rats did not have altered expression of these subunits, suggesting the changes we observed in schizophrenia are likely not due to chronic antipsychotic treatment. Interestingly, expression of the catalytic subunits of both the standard and immunoproteasome were unchanged, suggesting the abnormalities we observed may be specific to the complexed state of the proteasome. Aging has significant effects on the proteasome, and several subunits (20S β2, Rpn10, Rpn13, 11Sβ, and 11Sγ) were significantly correlated with subject age. These data provide further evidence of dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in schizophrenia, and suggest that altered proteasome activity may be associated with the pathophysiology of this illness. ","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" retains its definition as a psychiatric disorder, indicating no significant semantic drift over the period. Text A discusses schizophrenia in the context of its comorbidity with nonorganic insomnia and the effects of sedative neuroleptics. Text B delves into the biological underpinnings of schizophrenia, specifically focusing on abnormalities in the ubiquitin-proteasome system within the context of the disease. Both texts center on understanding and discussing schizophrenia as a psychiatric illness, albeit from different perspectives (clinical comorbidities and biomedical mechanisms). Thus, the core meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a mental health disorder remains consistent between the two texts."
3,Schizophrenia,"Case records of ninety consecutive first lifetime admissions with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia were examined for Schneiderian first rank symptoms, the Feighner diagnostic criteria, and the New Haven Schizophrenia Index. Diagnostic exclusion criteria were developed and applied. It is concluded that the hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia is likely to be too broad. Each diagnostic system can increase accuracy of diagnosis, but their exclusion criteria are too vague and the system would be improved by using those given here. Each diagnostic system selects similar groups of patients, and can be applied retrospectively to adequate case records.","People with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) show anomalies in language processing with respect to ""who is doing what"" in an action. This linguistic behavior is suggestive of an atypical representation of the formal concepts of ""Agent"" in the lexical representation of a verb, i.e., its thematic grid. To test this hypothesis, we administered a silent-reading task with sentences including a semantic violation of the animacy trait of the grammatical subject to 30 people with SSD and 30 healthy control participants (HCs). When the anomalous grammatical subject was the Agent of the event, a significant increase of Gaze Duration was observed in HCs, but not in SSDs. Conversely, when the anomalous subject was a Theme, SSDs displayed an increased probability of go-back movements, unlike HCs. These results are suggestive of a higher tolerability for anomalous Agents in SSD compared to the normal population. The fact that SSD participants did not show a similar tolerability for anomalous Themes rules out the issue of an attention deficit. We suggest that general communication abilities in SSD might benefit from explicit training on deep linguistic structures.","- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the target word ""schizophrenia"" refers to a diagnosable and studied mental health condition. Text A focuses on the diagnostic criteria and the broadness or specificity of diagnosing schizophrenia in a hospital setting. Text B examines specific cognitive and linguistic processing challenges faced by individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), indicating a continuity in viewing schizophrenia fundamentally as a mental health disorder with identifiable symptoms and impacts. Despite the shift in focus detailing more specific cognitive aspects in Text B, the underlying essence of schizophrenia as a mental health issue remains consistent across both texts."
4,Schizophrenia,"An impairment of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB) has repeatedly been described in schizophrenic patients. A BCB impairment can be due to vascular leakage during an inflammatory process, or to neuroleptic treatment. The soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) has been demonstrated to be a reliable marker for an inflammatory process causing an BCB impairment. To clarify the basis of a BCB impairment in schizophrenic patients, we measured the sICAM-1 levels in CSF of 40 schizophrenic patients. High concentrations of sICAM-1 were found to be related to high concentrations of albumin, IgG and total protein in CSF. A BCB impairment was associated with high levels of sICAM-1. Our data indicate an inflammatory mechanism of BCB impairment in schizophrenics and should enrich the discussion on an expanded immunological diagnosis in schizophrenia.","Aberrant glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission has been implicated in schizophrenia. Cariprazine reverses the behavioral effects observed in the rat phencyclidine (PCP)-induced model of schizophrenia; however, little is known about its in vivo neurochemistry.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
The term ""schizophrenia"" in both Text A and Text B is used within the context of discussing biological and physiological abnormalities associated with the condition. In Text A, the focus is on the inflammation-related impairment of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in schizophrenic patients, highlighting a potential biological marker and mechanism that might explain some aspects of the disorder. Similarly, Text B discusses the role of neurotransmitter dysregulation in schizophrenia, emphasizing abnormalities in glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission, and discussing research related to pharmaceutical interventions targeting these areas. 

Both texts showcase schizophrenia in a context that suggests biological underpinnings and disruptions in typical neural functioning as central to understanding and treating the disorder. Neither text diverts from a medical and scientific perspective focused on brain chemistry and function. Thus, the meaning and connotation of ""schizophrenia"" have remained consistent between the periods covered by these two texts, continuing to reflect it as a complex neurobiological disorder requiring biological-based insights and interventions."
5,Schizophrenia,"The association between psychotic symptoms and violence is unclear, due in part to methodological features of investigations that have examined this question, and in part to the fact that the association likely differs by disorder and treatment conditions. Using data from The Comparative Study of the Prevention of Crime and Violence by Mentally Ill Persons, we examined 128 men with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder discharged from general and forensic psychiatric hospitals in Canada, Finland, Germany, and Sweden. The association between symptoms and aggressive behavior was studied during two 6 month periods when the patients lived in the community. Severe positive and negative symptoms of psychosis, depression, and anxiety were measured at the beginning of each of the 6 month periods. In addition, at the beginning of the second 6 month period changes in symptoms in the previous period were indexed. Aggressive behavior was measured in each 6 month period by reports from patients and from collaterals. During the first 6 months post-discharge, after controlling for the presence of antisocial personality disorder or PCL score and past diagnoses of alcohol/drug abuse/dependence, the presence of a severe positive symptom significantly increased the risk of aggressive behavior. During the second 6 month period, after controlling for antisocial personality disorder or PCL score and self-reported alcohol/drug use, the presence of a severe positive symptom, a TCO symptom, and an increase in TCO symptoms significantly increased the risk of aggressive behavior. Neither depot medications nor obligatory community treatment reduced the risk of aggressive behavior after controlling for the presence of a severe positive symptom and/or TCO symptoms. These findings suggest that, among men with schizophrenia being treated in the community, the presence of severe psychotic symptoms and the development of TCO symptoms are antecedents of aggressive behavior.","Mitochondria have been linked to the etiology of schizophrenia (SZ). However, studies of mitochondria in SZ might be confounded by the effects of pharmacological treatment with antipsychotic drugs (APDs) and other common medications. This review summarizes findings on relevant mitochondria mechanisms underlying SZ, and the potential impact of psychoactive drugs including primarily APDs, but also antidepressants and anxiolytics. The summarized data suggest that APDs impair mitochondria function by decreasing Complex I activity and ATP production and dissipation of the mitochondria membrane potential. At the same time, in the brains of patients with SZ, antipsychotic drug treatment normalizes gene expression modules enriched in mitochondrial genes that are decreased in SZ. This indicates that APDs may have both positive and negative effects on mitochondria. The available evidence suggests three conclusions i) alterations in mitochondria functions in SZ exist prior to APD treatment, ii) mitochondria alterations in SZ can be reversed by APD treatment, and iii) APDs directly cause impairment of mitochondria function. Overall, the mechanisms of action of psychiatric drugs on mitochondria are both direct and indirect; we conclude the effects of APDs on mitochondria may contribute to both their therapeutic and metabolic side effects. These studies support the hypothesis that neuronal mitochondria are an etiological factor in SZ. Moreover, APDs and other drugs must be considered in the evaluation of this pathophysiological role of mitochondria in SZ. Considering these effects, pharmacological actions on mitochondria may be a worthwhile target for further APD development.","- Label: Unchanged 
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" refers to a psychiatric disorder that has complex symptoms and effects on individuals. Text A emphasizes the behavioral aspect of the disorder, particularly its relation to aggressive behavior. Text B shifts focus more towards the biological underpinnings and physiological aspects, specifically the role of mitochondria and the effects of antipsychotic drugs. However, the core concept of schizophrenia as a severe mental health condition with both behavioral and biological facets remains consistent between the two texts. The shift in focus does not signify a fundamental change in the meaning of the term but rather highlights different aspects of the research into the disorder. Therefore, the semantic usage of ""schizophrenia"" has not undergone significant change; the word still represents the same disorder with complex multimodal impacts."
6,Schizophrenia,The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in relationships between brain and behavior in schizophrenia.,There are pieces of evidence indicating that visual deficits in patients with schizophrenia can be attributed to a deficiency in the magnocellular portion of the early visual system. The main objective of this study was to investigate the neurological dysfunction of the magnocellular pathway in patients with schizophrenia using the frequency doubling technology perimetry (FDT). The FDT has been developed based on particular neural magnocellular characteristics and can examine the magnocellular dysfunction hypothesis in schizophrenia. Twenty patients with schizophrenia (12 males and 8 females) and 20 normal subjects (10 males and 10 females) participated in this study. The spatial frequency doubling task was presented via the Humphrey perimetry instrument in order to examine the magnocellular pathway of the participants. Patients with schizophrenia showed less visual field sensitivity than normal controls and their standardized age cohort in both eyes (p<0.001). The results indicated impaired visual field sensitivity deficits in patients with schizophrenia that can be attributed to a deficit in the magnocellular neural pathways. This Magnocellular pathway defect may provide a physiological base to explain some of the deficits caused by schizophrenia such as cognitive deficits. ,"### Answer:
- **Label**: Unchanged

- **Reason**:  
    In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" refers to a mental health condition characterized by specific neurological and cognitive abnormalities. Text A discusses the relationship between brain function and behavioral differences in schizophrenia, focusing on sex differences. This implies a neurological investigative perspective into schizophrenia. Text B, on the other hand, explores specific visual deficits in patients with schizophrenia attributed to abnormalities in the magnocellular part of the early visual system, targeting a particular aspect of neurological dysfunction. Despite the difference in the specific aspects studied (gender-based neurological relationships in Text A vs. visual system abnormalities in Text B), both texts fundamentally treat schizophrenia as a neurological disorder with cognitive and functional manifestations. Therefore, the semantic content and professional context of the term ""schizophrenia"" remain consistent across both texts, showing no significant drift in meaning but rather an expansion or deepening of the understanding of related symptoms and neurological underpinnings."
7,Schizophrenia,"This article examines the relationship between psychopathological subsyndromes in schizophrenia and cerebral alterations. A factor analysis of the psychopathological characteristics of 50 DSM-III schizophrenic patients revealed four subsyndromes. On the basis of these subsyndromes, four corresponding clusters of patients--remitted, chronic delusional, chronic asthenic, and chronic disorganized--were identified. These clusters were then compared with respect to negative symptoms, treatment response, neurological soft signs (NSS), and computed tomographic findings, such as the ventricle-brain ratio (VBR), using a discriminant analysis. The first discriminant function consisted of negative symptoms and significantly differentiated the remitted cluster from the three chronic clusters. Within the chronic clusters, the disorganized cluster was clearly identified by the second discriminant function (VBR and NSS). The third function (width of the interhemispheric fissure) provided only a tentative differentiation between the chronic delusional cluster and the chronic asthenic cluster. Although the subsyndromes of chronic schizophrenia share negative symptoms as a common feature, they appear to differ somewhat with regard to their morphological sites. These findings indicate that negative symptoms may arise from different psychopathological states and corroborate the existence of three subsyndromes in chronic schizophrenia.","The use of deep neural networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has rapidly progressed and gained popularity in recent years, but automatic feature extraction from EEG signals remains a challenging task. The classification of neuropsychiatric disorders demands the extraction of neuro-markers for use in automated EEG classification. Numerous advanced deep learning algorithms can be used for this purpose. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the main factors and parameters that affect the performance of deep neural networks in classifying different neuropsychiatric disorders using EEG signals. We also analyze the EEG features used for improving classification performance. Our analysis includes 82 scientific journal papers that applied deep neural networks for subject-wise classification based on EEG signals. We extracted information on the EEG dataset and types of disorders, deep neural network structures, performance, and hyperparameters. The results show that most studies have focused on clinical classification, achieving an average accuracy of 91.83 ± 7.34, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being the most frequently used network architecture and resting-state EEG signals being the most commonly used data type. Additionally, the review reveals that depression (N = 18), Alzheimer's (N = 11), and schizophrenia (N = 11) were studied more frequently than other types of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our review provides insight into the performance of deep neural networks in EEG classification and highlights the importance of EEG feature extraction in improving classification accuracy. By identifying the main factors and parameters that affect deep neural network performance in EEG classification, our review can guide future research in this area. We hope that our findings will encourage further exploration of deep learning methods for EEG classification and contribute to the development of more accurate and effective methods for diagnosing and monitoring neuropsychiatric disorders using EEG signals.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the use of the word ""schizophrenia"" relates to its role in the context of psychological and neurological research and diagnosis. Text A focuses on the morphological sites related to different subsyndromes of schizophrenia, using factor analysis and patient clusters to determine the relationship between psychopathological characteristics and brain alterations. Similarly, Text B discusses how advanced digital tools like deep neural networks are utilized to classify neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, using EEG signals and neurological markers.

In both instances, ""schizophrenia"" refers to a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by specific clinical and psychological patterns, though the techniques and technologies applied to study or diagnose the disorder differ due to advancements in the field. The core meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a medical diagnosis linked to particular brain and behavioral symptoms remains consistent between the two texts, showing no significant semantic drift in its usage over time."
8,Schizophrenia,"A considerable body of evidence suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is dysfunctional in schizophrenia. However, relatively few studies have explored the involvement of other areas of the frontal cortex. Research suggests that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays an important role in decision making processes. We assessed the decision making cognition of first-episode and chronic schizophrenic patients with a novel task sensitive to orbitofrontal dysfunction. Both first-episode and chronic patients with schizophrenia took longer than matched controls to make decisions, and both groups were also impaired on a measure of risk adjustment. The impairment in these measures was more severe in the chronic patients than in the first-episode patients, and only the chronic patients made significantly fewer optimal decisions than controls. These results contribute to increasing evidence of orbitofrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia, and suggest that disease progression or the effects of long term antipsychotic medication may influence performance on this task.","Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is at the center of cellular signaling and controls various aspects of brain functions, including development of the nervous system, neuronal plasticity and onset of neurodegenerative disorders. Areas covered: In this review, recent efforts in elucidating the roles of GSK3 in neuronal plasticity and development of brain pathologies; Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and age-related neurodegeneration are described. The effect of microglia and astrocytes on development of the pathological states is also discussed. Expert opinion: GSK3β and its signaling pathway partners hold great promise as therapeutic target(s) for a multitude of neurological disorders. Activity of the kinase is often elevated in brain disorders. However, due to the wide range of GSK3 cellular targets, global inhibition of the kinase leads to severe side-effects and GSK3 inhibitors rarely reach Phase-2 clinical trials. Thus, a selective modulation of a specific cellular pool of GSK3 or specific down- or upstream partners of the kinase might provide more efficient anti-neurodegenerative therapies.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" continues to be used in a medical and psychiatric context, referring to a mental disorder characterized by disruptions in thinking, perceptions, emotions, and behavior. 

Text A discusses schizophrenia primarily in relation to cognitive impairments, specifically decision-making deficits and possible influence of the orbitofrontal cortex, illustrating these attributes as a part of the disorder's impact on individuals. The text cites studies around cognition and uses terms like ""first-episode"" and ""chronic"" to describe stages or severity within schizophrenia, reflecting a clinical view of the disease progression.

Text B, while it touches on broader topics inclusive of other neurological disorders, still references schizophrenia in the context of brain functions and pathologies, discussing it alongside Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as related to abnormalities in cellular signaling pathways—specifically the roles of Glycogen synthase kinase 3. The text emphasizes ongoing research and potential therapies, showing continued recognition of schizophrenia as a significant neurodegenerative condition needing medical intervention.

Both texts, despite their different focuses within the medical field, portray ""schizophrenia"" with a consistent reference point as a serious brain disorder that affects cognitive and behavioral processes, supporting the idea that the meaning of the term ""schizophrenia"" remains unchanged between the two periods."
9,Schizophrenia,"The N-methyl D-aspartate receptor complex is involved in the mechanism of long-term potentiation, which is thought to be the biological basis of learning and memory. This complex can be manipulated in a number of ways, one of which is through the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor coagonist site. The effects of Bioglycin(Konapharma, Pratteln, Switzerland), a biologically active form of the amino acid glycine, were therefore studied in healthy students (mean age, 20.7 years) and middle-aged men (mean age, 58.9 years) with tests that measured attention, memory and mood, using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Compared with the young group, the middle-aged group had significantly poorer verbal episodic memory, focused, divided, and sustained attention; they also differed in their subjective responses at the end of testing. Bioglycin significantly improved retrieval from episodic memory in both the young and the middle-aged groups, but it did not affect focused or divided attention. However, the middle-aged men significantly benefited from Bioglycin in the sustained-attention task. The effects of Bioglycin differed from those of other cognitive enhancers in that it was without stimulant properties or significant effects on mood, and it primarily improved memory rather than attention. It is likely to be of benefit in young or older people in situations where high retrieval of information is needed or when performance is impaired by jet lag, shift work, or disrupted sleep. It may also benefit the impaired retrieval shown in patients with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.","Numerous studies have demonstrated that fluvoxamine has considerable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with clozapine.

In the given texts, the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains a similar meaning across both time periods. In Text A, schizophrenia is mentioned in the context of cognitive issues like impaired retrieval which can be improved by the described substance, hinting at its application in psychiatric disorders. In Text B, schizophrenia is directly addressed in a clinical study assessing the effects of medication on patients diagnosed with this disorder. In both instances, the term is used to refer to a psychiatric condition characterized by significant mental health issues that can potentially be managed or influenced by pharmacological treatments. The term does not exhibit any significant shift in meaning or connotation between the two periods (from Text A to Text B). Hence, the semantic usage is consistent regarding the description of schizophrenia as a mental health disorder."
10,Schizophrenia,"Many studies have indicated that excess free radical formation may be involved in the pathogenesis of patients with schizophrenia. Some investigators suggested that the use of free radical scavengers might provide improvement in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and to evaluate the side effects of extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) plus haloperidol in chronic, treatment-resistant inpatients with schizophrenia.","The objective of this paper was to collect normative data essential for analyzing the subplate (SP) role in pathogenesis of developmental disorders, characterized by abnormal circuitry, such as hypoxic-ischemic lesions, autism and schizophrenia. The main cytological features of the SP, such as low cell density, early differentiation of neurons and glia, plexiform arrangement of axons and dendrites, presence of synapses and a large amount of extracellular matrix (ECM) distinguish this compartment from the cell-dense cortical plate (CP; towards pia) and large fiber bundles of external axonal strata of fetal white matter (towards ventricle). For SP delineation from these adjacent layers based on combined cytological criteria, we analyzed the sublaminar distribution of different microstructural elements and the associated maturational gradients throughout development, using immunocytochemical and histological techniques on postmortem brain material (Zagreb Neuroembryological Collection). The analysis revealed that the SP compartment of the lateral neocortex shows changes in laminar organization throughout fetal development: the monolayer in the early fetal period (presubplate) undergoes dramatic bilaminar transformation between 13 and 15 postconceptional weeks (PCW), followed by subtle sublamination in three 'floors' (deep, intermediate, superficial) of midgestation (15-21 PCW). During the stationary phase (22-28 PCW), SP persists as a trilaminar compartment, gradually losing its sublaminar organization towards the end of gestation and remains as a single layer of SP remnant in the newborn brain. Based on these sublaminar transformations, we have documented developmental changes in the distribution, maturational gradients and expression of molecular markers in SP synapses, transitional forms of astroglia, neurons and ECM, which occur concomitantly with the ingrowth of thalamo-cortical, basal forebrain and cortico-cortical axons in a deep to superficial fashion. The deep SP is the zone of ingrowing axons - 'entrance (ingrowth) zone'. The process of axonal ingrowth begins with thalamo-cortical fibers and basal forebrain afferents, indicating an oblique geometry. During the later fetal period, deep SP receives long cortico-cortical axons exhibiting a tangential geometry. Intermediate SP ('proper') is the navigation and 'nexus' sublamina consisting of a plexiform arrangement of cellular elements providing guidance and substrate for axonal growth, and also containing transient connectivity of dendrites and axons in a tangential plane without radial boundaries immersed in an ECM-rich continuum. Superficial SP is the axonal accumulation ('waiting compartment') and target selection zone, indicating a dense distribution of synaptic markers, accumulation of thalamo-cortical axons (around 20 PCW), overlapping with dendrites from layer VI neurons. In the late preterm brain period, superficial SP contains a chondroitin sulfate non-immunoreactive band. The developmental dynamics for the distribution of neuronal, glial and ECM markers comply with sequential ingrowth of afferents in three levels of SP: ECM and synaptic markers shift from deep to superficial SP, with transient forms of glia following this arrangement, and calretinin neurons are concentrated in the SP during the formation phase. These results indicate developmental and morphogenetic roles in the SP cellular (transient glia, neurons and synapses) and ECM framework, enabling the spatial accommodation, navigation and establishment of numerous connections of cortical pathways in the expanded human brain. The original findings of early developmental dynamics of transitional subtypes of astroglia, calretinin neurons, ECM and synaptic markers presented in the SP are interesting in the light of recent concepts concerning its functional and morphogenetic role and an increasing interest in SP as a prospective substrate of abnormalities in cortical circuitry, leading to a cognitive deficit in different neurodevelopmental disorders.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: The target word ""schizophrenia"" in both Text A and Text B is used in a context where it is referenced as a medical or psychiatric condition that is studied for its pathogenesis and treated in different ways. In Text A, the focus is on biochemical aspects of schizophrenia, mentioning free radical formation and the benefits of antioxidants combined with medication in treatment-resistant cases. In Text B, despite the broader scope of exploring neurodevelopment, schizophrenia is mentioned as an example of a neurodevelopmental disorder, with emphasis on abnormalities in neural circuitry potentially leading to cognitive deficits. While the specifics of the discussion around schizophrenia vary between the two texts—focusing on biochemical approaches in one and structural changes in fetal development in the other—the fundamental conceptualization of schizophrenia as a neurological/psychiatric disorder remains unchanged between the periods. Both texts focus on understanding and addressing the condition through scientific study, even though the specific mechanisms and treatment approaches discussed differ."
11,Schizophrenia,"Hospital admission rates for schizophrenia are higher in Afro-Caribbean immigrants to Britain than in the white British-born population. However, the reported differences in incidence and prevalence could be due to confounding variables: the diagnosis of schizophrenia might not carry the same prognostic implications in the two groups; and the differences in formal admission rates might not persist when demographic and diagnostic differences are allowed for. The case-notes of 50 Afro-Caribbean immigrants and 41 British-born white patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia were examined retrospectively, the average period covered being 12 years. There were no differences in the number of readmissions, but in the Afro-Caribbean group readmissions were shorter. Involuntary admissions were twice as common in Afro-Caribbeans and this excess was not explained by differences in age, sex, or type of illness. The reported excess of schizophrenia in Afro-Caribbean immigrants to Britain is real, but the illness seems to run a milder course than in the white British-born population.","Previous research in patients with schizophrenia in European and USA population groups has demonstrated a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and disease progression (~35%-40%) and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and long-term mortality. Limited research has determined the prevalence of existing cardiometabolic risk factors at onset of a first episode psychosis. This cross-sectional study presents a clinical overview of the cardiometabolic risk profile in young people with first episode psychosis in the UK. Forty-six participants (72% male) clinically diagnosed with first episode psychosis (n = 25), schizophrenia (n = 13), bipolar disorder (n = 4), unspecified non-organic psychosis (n = 2) or acute psychotic episode (n = 2) with < 6 months Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP; mean 33.4 ± 37.2 days) were assessed for anthropometric, health risk behaviors and clinical measurements including resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood lipids, glycated hemoglobin, and prolactin. Overall, participants (aged 18-37 years) had a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors due to: elevated values for BMI (73%) and abdominal adiposity (50%), blood pressure (47% prehypertensive; 23% hypertensive), resting heart rate (43%); hypercholesterolemia (32%); suboptimal HDL-C levels (36%); and hypertriglyceridemia (40%). Participants also self-reported poor health risk habits including smoking (55%), alcohol use (39%), substance use (18%), poor diet (52%), and sedentary behavior (29%). Young people with psychosis are at increased risk for cardiometabolic disorders due to elevated clinical markers and health risk behaviors. Physical health interventions (including health behavior advice) are needed early in the treatment process to address this increased risk for cardiometabolic disorders in individuals recently diagnosed with psychosis.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used to refer to the same underlying mental health condition characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired cognitive function. Text A focuses on demographic and epidemiological aspects of schizophrenia in different populations within the UK, discussing hospital admission rates, course of illness, and characteristics of the condition in different ethnic groups. Text B, while also discussing schizophrenia, focuses on a related aspect—physical health issues and cardiometabolic risks associated with the condition among young people at the onset of first episode psychosis, including those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite the difference in specific focus areas (demographic and epidemiological in Text A versus health risks in Text B), the core clinical concept and understanding of schizophrenia as a mental health disorder remain consistent across the two texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the use of the term ""schizophrenia"" between the two time periods analyzed in these texts."

The objective of this paper is to explore a reductionist assumption underlying this paradigm, and to suggest an improvement on it.

The results are that complete reduction to physicochemical explanations is not fruitful, at least in the initial stages of research in the medical and life sciences, and that an appropriate (non-reducible) integrative principle--addressing a property of the whole system under study--is required for each domain of research. This is illustrated in Pauling's use of a topological integrative principle for the discovery of the functioning of proteins and in Watson and Crick's use of the notion of a genetic code as an integrative principle for the discovery of the structure of genes. The neurotransmitter dysfunction paradigm addresses single molecules and their neural pathways, yet their interactions within the CNS as a whole seem most pertinent to mental disorders such as schizophrenia. The lack within biological psychiatry of an integrative principle addressing a property of the CNS as a whole may be responsible for the empirical failure of orthomolecular psychiatry, as well as for the central role that serendipity has played in the study of mental disorders, which is dominated by the neurotransmitter paradigm. The conclusion is that research in biological psychiatry may benefit from using, at least initially, some integrative principle(s) addressing a property of the CNS as a whole, such as connectionism or a hierarchical notion.","Insomnia commonly occurs in schizophrenia, and insomnia is associated with suicide risk. Clozapine has anti-suicidal properties and beneficial effects on sleep. We performed a meta-analysis of insomnia in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine. We hypothesized that compared to clozapine there is an increased odds of insomnia in patients treated with other antipsychotics.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" primarily indicates a psychiatric condition—part of a broader discussion within the field of mental disorders. Text A focuses on the general neurobiological and psychiatric paradigms and approaches involved in the understanding of mental disorders like schizophrenia. It critiques the narrow focus on neurotransmitter dysfunction and advocates for a more integrative approach that considers the CNS (Central Nervous System) as a whole. Text B, while more clinically oriented, also situates schizophrenia as a psychiatric condition, discussing its association with insomnia and evaluating the effects of the antipsychotic medication, clozapine. Both texts maintain a clinical and medical view of schizophrenia without deviating into metaphorical or significantly different meanings. Thus, the meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as representing a specific mental health condition remains consistent between both texts despite their different focuses within psychiatric research and treatment."
13,Schizophrenia,"The pathophysiology of akathisia still remains controversial. Iron deficiency was proposed to be an important factor in the development of akathisia. In the present study, it was aimed to compare levels of serum iron and linked variables in chronic akathisic (n=30), and non-akathisic patients (n=30) with schizophrenia and healthy controls (n=30) because of the controversy in the association of iron and akathisia. The Barnes Akathisia Scale for akathisia and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale for extrapyramidal side effects were used. Serum iron and linked variables and hematological profile of the patients and control subjects were determined. Serum iron levels were significantly lower both in akathisic and non-akathisic groups compared to the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, akathisic patients had significantly lower iron levels than non-akathisic patients (P<0.05). Total iron binding capacity was significantly higher in patients with akathisia compared to the control group (P<0.01). Although non-akathisic patients had a mild increase in total iron binding capacity, it was not statistically significant compared to the control group (P>0.05). Ferritin levels were determined to be significantly lower in both groups compared to the control group (P<0.01). In addition, there was a significant difference in ferritin levels between the patients with and without akathisia (P<0.05). In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that an association between akathisia and iron metabolism exists.",Advancements in cellular reprogramming techniques have made it possible to directly study brain cells from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. We have systematically reviewed the applications of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) and their neural derivatives in understanding the biological basis of schizophrenia.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both Text A and Text B utilize the word ""schizophrenia"" to refer to the same neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired cognitive function. In Text A, the focus is on exploring biochemical factors (specifically iron metabolism) associated with a condition (akathisia) in patients with schizophrenia. The text discusses the involved physiological and chemical investigations, emphasizing schizophrenia in the context of studying patient groups with and without the complication of akathisia. In Text B, the word ""schizophrenia"" occurs in the context of studying the disorder at a cellular level through the use of advanced biomedical technologies like induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, the word pertains directly to the disorder and its biological basis.

In both texts, despite the changing methods and approaches over time (from biochemical assessments to genetic and cellular models), the underlying meaning and utilization of the word ""schizophrenia"" as a specific psychiatric condition remain consistent. There is no shift observed in the basic medical definition or the context in which the term is used in relation to describing the disorder itself."
14,Schizophrenia,"Linkage studies have suggested a locus for bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia in the pericentric region of chromosome 18. Several candidate genes have been identified in the region including ACTH, IMP, and G(olf), however no reports of mutations in families showing linkage to the 18p11 locus have been reported. Recently, mild linkage disequilibrium has been observed with a polymorphic marker that maps within the G(olf) gene and schizophrenia in families from Germany and Israel, suggesting that a gene mapping near G(olf) may be involved in psychiatric disorders. A BAC and cosmid contig around the G(olf) locus has been generated and BAC clones were used for cDNA selection experiments. Several novel genes have been identified which are expressed in the brain. These genes may be possible candidate genes for psychiatric illness.","Wayne Fenton, MD, died on September 3, 2006, while giving emergency clinical care. His leadership at National Institute of Mental Health provided a framework for therapeutic discovery. He crafted a new approach to psychosis based on poor functional outcomes and the psychopathology domains underlying long-term morbidity. His research and clinical observations during his career at the Chestnut Lodge clarified the unmet therapeutic needs in schizophrenia and provided the foundation for his vision. The results have radically changed the paradigm for discovery with emphasis on impaired cognition and negative symptom psychopathology.","### Answer:
- Target word: Schizophrenia
- Text A: Discusses genetic predispositions and linkage studies involving schizophrenia, looking into possible genetic connections by observing associations with specific genes like G(olf) on chromosome 18. 
- Text B: Focuses on societal and clinical impacts, mentioning a change in clinical approaches to treating schizophrenia, focusing on functional outcomes, and psychopathology domains rather than purely on genetic or biological aspects.

- Label: **Changed**
- Reason: The use of ""schizophrenia"" has drifted from a more genetically and biologically oriented discussion in Text A to an approach in Text B that emphasizes the clinical treatment, patient outcomes, and broader psychopathology. This shows a shift in both the understanding and the contextual utilization of the term, moving towards a more holistic and patient-centered understanding in clinical practice by 2006 as opposed to the predominantly research-focused biological approach discussed in Text A. This reflects a significant semantic evolution in the term's usage within the field of psychiatry, indicating a changed approach to the disorder."
15,Schizophrenia,"Lack of relevant information has been stated as a major obstacle to the development of better services for persons with serious mental disorders. The information on patients not in contact with the specialist services seems to be particularly incomplete. The objective of this study was to describe a subgroup of psychiatric patients living in a semi-rural municipality in Norway who had no contact with the specialist mental health services. 15 patients below 70 years of age (0.3% of the population at risk) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia from psychiatric hospital, and still on neuroleptic maintenance-treatment prescribed by a primary physician were identified. The authors present the characteristics of this group, with emphasis on their health status, their social network, and the actual treatment and care provided, and discuss the need for clear case-definitions in community surveys of psychiatric disorders. They finally describe the current trend towards new and improved models for cooperation between the primary health care and the specialist services.",The aim of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and associated factors among patients with schizophrenia at comprehensive specialised hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia.,"- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" consistently refers to a serious mental disorder categorized by distinct and recognized characteristics. Text A primarily focuses on the social and treatment aspects of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who remain outside the contact of specialist mental health services. It evaluates the health status and social framework surrounding these individuals, and maintains a clinical perspective on schizophrenia. Similarly, Text B discusses the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in a specific region, again retaining a clinical and healthcare-oriented viewpoint on the disorder. There is no indication in Text B that the understanding or semantic scope of ""schizophrenia"" has evolved from what is described in Text A. Both texts align in treating schizophrenia as a diagnosable, treatable psychiatric condition, focusing on the health and quality of life of those affected."
16,Schizophrenia,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often efficacious in severe depression, and it is occasionally used in the treatment of schizophrenia. The mechanism of action of ECT is still poorly understood. We evaluated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) after a first ECT and at the end of a series of seven ECTs in eight unipolar depressed patients with blunted basal TSH/TRH response, eight unipolar depressed patients with normal TSH/TRH response, and eight schizophrenic patients. The hormone patterns obtained after the first ECT showed an increase in prolactin and a decrease in TSH in all groups of patients, suggesting a nonspecific response. At the end of the therapeutic course, TSH responses increased in both groups of depressed patients, and the elevation was more relevant in depressed patients with normal TSH/TRH. Our data suggest that the mechanism of action of ECT becomes more specific when it is performed chronically and differs according to the organic substrate underlying different mental disorders. Moreover, an aminergic activation in the two groups of depressed patients seems to take place.","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising augmentation treatment for schizophrenia, however there are few controlled studies of rTMS augmentation of clozapine.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A from an earlier period and Text B from a later period, the target word ""schizophrenia"" continues to refer to a mental disorder treated by medical interventions. Despite the treatments evolving from Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) to Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), the core concept of schizophrenia as a serious psychological condition necessitating medical intervention remains consistent. There is no significant alteration in the understanding or connotation of the term ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts; it is still being discussed within the medical and treatment paradigm. The primary focus in both instances is on therapeutic methods aimed at alleviating or managing its symptoms, indicating the term has maintained its meaning over time."
17,Schizophrenia,"Among 76 chronic schizophrenic patients, plasma amine oxidase activity was unrelated to paranoid/nonparanoid subtype, narrow/broad diagnostic criteria, prognosis, or age at onset.

- Reason: The target word ""schizophrenia"" refers to a psychiatric condition characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality in both texts. Text A discusses biological factors and diagnostic subtypes related to schizophrenia, indicating the multifaceted aspects of diagnosing and studying the condition. Text B references schizophrenia in the context of its possible development due to external influences like cannabis use, discussing the risks and associative factors. Despite the different contexts – biological characteristics in Text A and risk factors in Text B – the underlying definition of ""schizophrenia"" as a serious mental health condition remains consistently aligned across both texts. The term has not shifted in its fundamental meaning or connotation over the time period between these texts."
18,Schizophrenia,"In a recent article, Andreasen and Flaum (Schizophrenia Bulletin, Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991) argued that greater emphasis should be placed on negative symptoms in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, leading to a less important role for positive symptoms. This article presents a counter-argument to this view. Positive symptoms are common and reliable and therefore highly useful diagnostically. First-rank symptoms, although not specific to schizophrenia, show good discriminability. No other type of symptom or investigative method can make such claims to usefulness. Although positive symptoms do not predict outcome, this is not a necessary function of diagnostic criteria. The predictive power of negative symptoms is, in any case, based largely on studies of patients with chronic disorder. Premorbidly impaired social development may interact with schizophrenia, worsening the prognosis. We believe positive symptoms have always been the essence of psychiatric disorder and should remain so. Increasing the diagnostic weight given to negative symptoms risks restricting the definition of schizophrenia excessively.","Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent that is pharmacologically different from other stimulants. It has been investigated in healthy volunteers, and in individuals with clinical disorders associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, impaired cognition and other symptoms. This review examines the use of modafinil in clinical practice based on the results of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials available in the English language in the MEDLINE database. In sleep-deprived individuals, modafinil improves mood, fatigue, sleepiness and cognition to a similar extent as caffeine but has a longer duration of action. Evidence for improved cognition in non-sleep-deprived healthy volunteers is controversial.Modafinil improves excessive sleepiness and illness severity in all three disorders for which it has been approved by the US FDA, i.e. narcolepsy, shift-work sleep disorder and obstructive sleep apnoea with residual excessive sleepiness despite optimal use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, its effects on safety on the job and on morbidities associated with these disorders have not been ascertained. Continued use of CPAP in obstructive sleep apnoea is essential. Modafinil does not benefit cataplexy.In very small, short-term trials, modafinil improved excessive sleepiness in patients with myotonic dystrophy. It was efficacious in fairly large studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents, and was as efficacious as methylphenidate in a small trial, but has not been approved by the FDA, in part because of its serious dermatological toxicity. In a trial of 21 non-concurrent subjects, with 2-week treatment periods, modafinil was as effective as dexamfetamine in adult ADHD. Modafinil was helpful for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder in a trial that excluded patients with stimulant-induced mania. A single dose of modafinil may hasten recovery from general anaesthesia after day surgery. A single dose of modafinil improved the ability of emergency room physicians to attend didactic lectures after a night shift, but did not improve their ability to drive home and caused sleep disturbances subsequently.Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo.Trials of modafinil for excessive sleepiness in Parkinson's disease, cocaine addiction and cognition in chronic fatigue syndrome provided inconsistent results; all studies had extremely small sample sizes. Modafinil cannot be recommended for these conditions until definitive data become available.Modafinil induces and inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and has the potential for interacting with drugs from all classes. The modafinil dose should be reduced in the elderly and in patients with hepatic disease. Caution is needed in patients with severe renal insufficiency because of substantial increases in levels of modafinil acid. Common adverse events with modafinil include insomnia, headache, nausea, nervousness and hypertension. Decreased appetite, weight loss and serious dermatological have been reported with greater frequency in children and adolescents, probably due to the higher doses (based on bodyweight) used. Modafinil may have some abuse/addictive potential although no cases have been reported to date.","###Answer:
- Target word: Schizophrenia
- Text A: Discusses mainly the diagnostic considerations, emphasizing the differentiation between positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The focus is on distinguishing traits of the disease itself, rather than treatment aspects. It engages in a theoretical debate about the diagnostic relevance and prognosis linked to different symptoms of schizophrenia.

- Text B: Primarily addresses the use of a drug, modafinil, and its efficacy concerning a range of conditions including excessive sleepiness, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Among these, schizophrenia is mentioned in a broad spectrum of pathological conditions being evaluated for treatment effectiveness. The mention of schizophrenia here refers to the management of specific symptoms, particularly in relation to depressive symptoms within the broader spectrum of the disorder.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, schizophrenia is discussed in the context of fundamental psychiatric diagnostic characteristics and symptomatology. In Text B, while schizophrenia is mentioned, it relates specifically to the management of certain symptoms using medication, reflecting a shift from a purely diagnostic discourse to a treatment-oriented context. This suggests a semantic expansion or drift where schizophrenia not just encapsulates diagnostic criteria but increasingly includes treatment and management aspects in its semantic content in contemporary discussions."
19,Schizophrenia,"In an attempt to replicate a potential linkage on chromosome 22q12-q13.1 reported by Pulver et al. [1994: Am J Med Genet 54:36-43], we have analyzed 4 microsatellite markers which span this chromosomal region, including the IL2RB locus, for linkage with schizophrenia in 30 families from Israel and Germany. Linkage analysis by pairwise lod score analysis as well as by multipoint analysis did not provide evidence for a single major gene locus. However, a lod score of Zmax = 0.612 was obtained for a dominant model of inheritance with the marker D22S304 at recombination fraction 0.2 by pairwise analysis. In addition, using a nonparametric method, sib pair analysis, a P value of 0.068 corresponding to a lod score of 0.48 was obtained for this marker. This finding, together with those of Pulver et al. [1994: Am J Med Genet 54:36-43] and Coon et al. [1994: Am J Med Genet 54:72-79], is suggestive of a genetic factor in this region, predisposing for schizophrenia in a subset of families. Further studies using nonparametric methods should be conducted in order to clarify this point.","The DSM-III, III-R and DSM-IV diagnostic systems required deterioration (functional loss) and duration (6 months) in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. These criteria made schizophrenia exceptional to an otherwise phenomenologically-based nosology, but their inclusion represented an effort to disentangle the diagnosis of schizophrenia from considerable historical baggage. Newer findings about the efforts of early detection and intervention in schizophrenia, however, are now calling into question the validity, utility and even the safety of these decisions. This communication will review the original reasons for including deterioration and duration as criteria. It will then argue that these reasons are now obsolete and potentially anti-therapeutic, and that a revised set of cross-sectional phenomenologic criteria for schizophrenia need to be utilized as soon as possible.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A from earlier and Text B from a later period, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used within the context of medical and psychological research and diagnosis. Text A focuses on the genetic research aspects of schizophrenia, exploring the potential linkage of certain genetic markers to the predisposition for schizophrenia. This aligns with the classic understanding of schizophrenia as a psychiatric disorder potentially influenced by genetic factors. 

Text B discusses schizophrenia in the context of its diagnostic criteria, particularly highlighting the evolution and critique of diagnostic approaches, such as the inclusion of criteria like deterioration and duration which have historically defined the disorder but are now being reconsidered. The core focus remains on the disorder's characteristics, diagnosis, and the implications of these criteria on treatment and understanding of the disorder.

Both texts, despite having different focal points (genetic linkage vs. diagnostic criteria), treat schizophrenia fundamentally as a disorder with complex origins and manifestations, consistent with ongoing medical and psychological understanding. There is no significant shift or change in the meaning or the basic connotation of the term ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts, indicating that the semantic usage of the word has remained stable over time."
20,Schizophrenia,"Dysfunction of the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia may be associated with alterations in the regulation of brain metabolism. To determine whether abnormal expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular metabolism contributes to this dysfunction, we used cDNA microarrays to perform gene expression profiling of all major metabolic pathways in postmortem samples of PFC area 9 from 10 subjects with schizophrenia and 10 matched control subjects. Genes comprising 71 metabolic pathways were assessed in each pair, and only five pathways showed consistent changes (decreases) in subjects with schizophrenia. Reductions in expression were identified for genes involved in the regulation of ornithine and polyamine metabolism, the mitochondrial malate shuttle system, the transcarboxylic acid cycle, aspartate and alanine metabolism, and ubiquitin metabolism. Interestingly, although most of the metabolic genes that were consistently decreased across subjects with schizophrenia were not similarly decreased in haloperidol-treated monkeys, the transcript encoding the cytosolic form of malate dehydrogenase displayed prominent drug-associated increases in expression compared with untreated animals. These molecular analyses implicate a highly specific pattern of metabolic alterations in the PFC of subjects with schizophrenia and raise the possibility that antipsychotic medications may exert a therapeutic effect, in part, by normalizing some of these changes.","Although paternal age has been linked to certain psychiatric disorders, the nature of any causal relationship remains elusive. Here, we aimed to comprehensively assess the magnitude of a wide range of offspring's psychiatric risk conferred by paternal age, leveraging a pedigree inferred from covered-insurance relationship (accuracy >98%) in Taiwan's single-payer compulsory insurance program. We also examined whether there is an independent role of paternal age and explored the potential effect of parental age difference. A total cohort of 7,264,788 individuals born between 1980 and 2018 were included; 5,572,232 with sibling(s) were selected for sibling-comparison analyses and 1,368,942 and 1,044,420 children with information of paternal-grandparents and maternal-grandparents, respectively, were selected for multi-generation analyses. Using inpatient/outpatient claims data (1997-2018), we identified schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder (BPD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), eating disorder (ED), substance use disorder (SUD), mental retardation (MR), tic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and somatoform disorder. We identified suicides using death certificates. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the paternal/maternal/grand-paternal age association with psychiatric risk in the offspring. The total cohort and sibling-comparison cohort resulted in similar estimates. Paternal age had a U-shaped relationship with offspring's MDD, ED, SUD, and anxiety. A very young maternal age (<20 years) was associated with markedly higher risk in offspring's SUD, MR, and suicide. Older paternal age (>25 years) was linearly associated with offspring's schizophrenia, autism, BPD, ADHD, MDD, ED, SUD, MR, OCD, anxiety, and suicide. Older grand-paternal age was linearly associated with offspring's schizophrenia, autism, ADHD, and MR. Dissimilar parental age was positively associated with offspring's ADHD, MDD, SUD, MR, anxiety, and suicide, and negatively associated with offspring's OCD. This comprehensive assessment provides solid evidence for the independent role of paternal age in psychiatric risk in the offspring and clarifies the significance of both early parenthood and delayed paternity.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
    In both texts, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used to refer to a psychiatric disorder characterized by specific patterns of behavior and altered perceptions of reality. Text A focuses on specific alterations in gene expression related to metabolic pathways in the prefrontal cortex of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, indicating that these genetic changes could contribute to the observed symptoms of the disorder. Text B addresses a broader epidemiological study which links paternal age and the risk of developing schizophrenia among other disorders, suggesting a genetic or developmental influence on the risk of this psychiatric condition.

    In both instances, ""schizophrenia"" consistently refers to a mental health condition with biological underpinnings and clinical manifestations, highlighting both the genetic research aspects and public health considerations. Therefore, the core meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a psychiatric disorder remains consistent between the two texts, despite different research focuses and methodologies applied in each scenario."
21,Schizophrenia,"As people live longer, an increasing proportion of patients with schizophrenia and delusional disorder will be elderly. Little has been published on treatment response, effective treatment strategies, or the use of atypical neuroleptics in this group. This review of the literature explores documented response rate, route and dose of neuroleptic, indicators of poor response, and the use of novel drugs. Despite great variation in the neuroleptic dose ranges employed, patients with late-onset disease often continue to experience psychotic symptoms. Compliance with treatment is the most important determinant of outcome. Atypical neuroleptics are specifically indicated for patients with visual hallucinations or extrapyramidal symptoms. Elderly psychotic patients should be treated as vigorously and with as wide a range of neuroleptics as their younger counterparts. Physicians should not restrict drug doses to modest levels in all cases as long as patients are monitored frequently for the emergence of side effects.","The aim of the present study was to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with relapse in schizophrenia. The study group consisted of a convenience sample of 40 schizophrenia patients (20 patients each in relapse and remission). Relapse and remission were defined based on clinical criteria (ICD-10 criteria, course since last episode, and duration of remission) and psychometric criteria (scores on Socio-Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale [SOFAS] and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia [PANSS]). The index group was evaluated after the occurrence of current relapse but within 6 months of its onset. Sociodemographic, current psychopathology (PANSS) and functioning (SOFAS), and other (mainly retrospective) variables were assessed with a specifically designed clinical profile sheet, Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Lifetime version, Presumptive Stressful life Events Scale, and World Health Organization Life Chart Schedule for Assessment of Course and Outcome of Schizophrenia. Patients who had relapsed were more symptomatic and exhibited greater dysfunction in comparison to remitted patients. Relapse in schizophrenia was significantly associated with unemployment, number of psychotic episodes, side-effects of medication, and life events score. The present findings suggest that a severe illness (no. psychotic episodes, unemployment), psychological stress and inappropriate treatment (side-effects of medicines) may be causally related to relapse in schizophrenia. However, the possibility that these variables may be caused by relapse or may be explained by a common underlying variable needs to be assessed prospectively.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is consistently used within the realm of psychiatric disorders, specifically characterized by its classic symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Text A discusses the manifestation and treatment of schizophrenia in elder patients, emphasizing the use of neuroleptics and the challenges posed by late-onset disease. Text B focuses on sociodemographic and clinical factors influencing relapse in schizophrenia among patients, assessing clinical outcomes and associations with various life factors. In both cases, ""schizophrenia"" refers to a chronic mental health condition with specific symptoms, treatments, and impacts on life quality, maintaining the same semantic context across the years represented by both texts. Even though different aspects of the disease and its management are emphasized, the fundamental conceptualization of schizophrenia as a mental health diagnosis remains unchanged."
22,Schizophrenia,"B. Ritzler (J. Abnorm. Psychol., 86: 501-504, 1977) failed to replicate previous weight-lifting studies showing a proprioceptive deficit in schizophrenics. However, Ritzler did not use the same standard weights that the previous studies employed. Could this difference in procedure have caused his failure to replicate? Two experiments were completed to provide additional information about this question and related issues. In Experiment I, chronic hospitalized schizophrenics and normals were tested with light and heavy weights. Rosenbaum's original modified method of limits and the method of constant stimuli were utilized. Both methods provided comparable results, which, like Ritzler's data, failed to show a differential impairment in the discrimination of the light weights for paranoid schizophrenics. In Experiment II, outpatient paranoid schizophrenics, outpatient nonparanoid schizophrenics, outpatient psychiatric patients, and aged normals were evaluated utilizing the same psychophysical procedure and standard weights employed in the original studies. No differential impairment was found for the light weights for any group. These results provide strong support for Ritzler's position that a proprioceptive deficit is not unique to schizophrenia.","BACKGROUND: Topiramate is a new antiepileptic drug, originally designed as an oral hypoglycaemic subsequently approved as anticonvulsant. It has increasingly been used in the treatment of numerous psychiatric conditions and it has also been associated with weight loss potentially relevant in reversing weight gain induced by psychotropic medications. This article reviews pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of topiramate, its biological putative role in treating psychiatric disorders and its relevance in clinical practice. METHODS: A comprehensive search from a range of databases was conducted and papers addressing the topic were selected. RESULTS: Thirty-two published reports met criteria for inclusion, 4 controlled and 28 uncontrolled studies. Five unpublished controlled studies were also identified in the treatment of acute mania. CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate lacks efficacy in the treatment of acute mania. Increasing evidence, based on controlled studies, supports the use of topiramate in binge eating disorders, bulimia nervosa, alcohol dependence and possibly in bipolar disorders in depressive phase. In the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorders, as adjunctive treatment in refractory bipolar disorder in adults and children, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, unipolar depression, emotionally unstable personality disorder and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome the evidence is entirely based on open label studies, case reports and case series. Regarding weight loss, findings are encouraging and have potential implications in reversing increased body weight, normalisation of glycemic control and blood pressure. Topiramate was generally well tolerated and serious adverse events were rare.","###Answer:
- Target word: Schizophrenia

- Text A: This passage examines various experiments and findings regarding proprioceptive deficits in schizophrenics. The focus here is clearly on schizophrenia's potential association with differences in sensory or perceptual functions as compared to non-schizophrenic groups. The word ""schizophrenia"" is used in the clinical context of studying neurological or sensory deficits.

- Text B: This text pertains to the use of the drug Topiramate for various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. The usage of ""schizophrenia"" here extends to treatment context, discussing how this medication might be relevant for managing symptoms or associated conditions (such as weight gain or other psychiatric symptoms) in schizophrenic patients.

- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: The fundamental connotation of “schizophrenia” as a psychiatric disorder remains constant in both texts. In Text A, it’s discussed in relation to specific sensory deficits and experimental evidence underlying such associations, while in Text B, the discussion revolves around therapeutic management and medication efficacy. Despite different applications (clinical trials and treatment discussions), the underlying meaning — a psychiatric disorder — remains consistent. Thus, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Unchanged""."
23,Schizophrenia,"Concomitant fluvoxamine use can potentially reduce the dosage of clozapine needed in treatment-refractory patients with schizophrenia. Previous reports have shown that fluvoxamine can increase plasma clozapine concentrations by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine, 50 mg/day, coadministration with clozapine, 100 mg/day, in refractory schizophrenic patients.","Mice and rats emit and perceive calls in the ultrasonic range, i.e., above the human hearing threshold of about 20 kHz: so-called ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). Juvenile and adult rats emit 22-kHz USV in aversive situations, such as predator exposure and fighting or during drug withdrawal, whereas 50-kHz USV occur in appetitive situations, such as rough-and-tumble play and mating or in response to drugs of abuse, e.g., amphetamine. Aversive 22-kHz USV and appetitive 50-kHz USV serve distinct communicative functions. Whereas 22-kHz USV induce freezing behavior in the receiver, 50-kHz USV lead to social approach behavior. These opposite behavioral responses are paralleled by distinct patterns of brain activation. Freezing behavior in response to 22-kHz USV is paralleled by increased neuronal activity in brain areas regulating fear and anxiety, such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray, whereas social approach behavior elicited by 50-kHz USV is accompanied by reduced activity levels in the amygdala but enhanced activity in the nucleus accumbens, a brain area implicated in reward processing. These opposing behavioral responses, together with distinct patterns of brain activation, particularly the bidirectional tonic activation or deactivation of the amygdala elicited by 22-kHz and 50-kHz USV, respectively, concur with a wealth of behavioral and neuroimaging studies in humans involving emotionally salient stimuli, such as fearful and happy facial expressions. Affective ultrasonic communication therefore offers a translational tool for studying the neurobiology underlying socio-affective communication. This is particularly relevant for rodent models of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social and communication deficits, such as autism and schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Despite the different contexts where the target word ""schizophrenia"" appears in Text A and Text B, the basic meaning of the term remains consistent across the texts. In Text A, ""schizophrenia"" is clearly used within the domain of psychopharmacology and treatment primarily discussing its management in treatment-refractory patients. In Text B, schizophrenia is mentioned in a broader context relating to the study of neurodevelopmental disorders and their impact on social and communication behaviors, particularly modeling behaviors in rodents that parallel certain features observed in humans with schizophrenia. Both texts address aspects of schizophrenia highlighting the disorder's impacts on brain functions and behaviors, but Text A is specific to the treatment and management while Text B deals more with fundamental research and understanding behavioral manifestations. Thus, there is no significant shift in the meaning of ""schizophrenia"" between the texts, merely a shift in application and dimension of discussion."
24,Schizophrenia,"In the aftermath of deinstitutionalization, when current public policy dictates greater community management of schizophrenia, patients and their families play an increasing role in the treatment of the illness. Since mental health professionals often neglect to educate them on the causes, symptoms, and treatment of schizophrenia, patients and their families are often misinformed, fearful, and ill-equipped to aid in treatment. The authors describe a brief family educational intervention and the questionnaire that was used to compare the knowledge of patients and their families who received the intervention with the knowledge of those who did not. The findings suggest that patients and their families in family treatment programs can acquire and retain information about schizophrenia more readily than patients and families involved in individual treatment. This knowledge enables them to become more effective participants in aftercare and helps surmount the problems associated with posthospital adjustment.","Brain-specific loss of a microtubule-binding protein collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) in the mouse recapitulates many schizophrenia-like behaviors of human patients, possibly resulting from associated developmental deficits in neuronal differentiation, path-finding, and synapse formation. However, it is still unclear how the Crmp2 loss affects neuronal circuit function and plasticity. By conducting in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recording in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we reveal that CRMP2 exerts a key regulation on the timing of postnatal critical period (CP) for experience-dependent circuit plasticity of sensory cortex. In the developing V1, the Crmp2 deficiency induces not only a delayed maturation of visual tuning functions but also a precocious CP for visual input-induced ocular dominance plasticity and its induction activity - coincident binocular inputs right after eye-opening. Mechanistically, the Crmp2 deficiency accelerates the maturation process of cortical inhibitory transmission and subsequently promotes an early emergence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory cortical circuits during the postnatal development. Moreover, the precocious CP plasticity results in deteriorated binocular depth perception in adulthood. Thus, these findings suggest that the Crmp2 deficiency dysregulates the timing of CP for experience-dependent refinement of circuit connections and further leads to impaired sensory perception in later life.","###Answer:
- Label: Changed
- Reason: The use of the term ""schizophrenia"" shows a notable shift from Text A to Text B. In Text A, schizophrenia is discussed primarily in the context of its societal and familial impacts, focusing on education and social adjustment of patients post-deinstitutionalization. The emphasis is on the psychological, social, and educational aspects of managing the disease in a community setting. Contrastingly, Text B delves into the neurobiological specifics of the disease, particularly how the loss of a microtubule-binding protein (CRMP2) affects neuronal development and circuit function, aligning with behaviors observed in schizophrenia. This represents a shift from a more social and clinical perspective to a more detailed biogenetic and neurophysiological understanding, highlighting the advancements in scientific research related to the molecular and biological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia."
25,Schizophrenia,"The extent of the genetic component, if any, in DSM III schizophrenia still remains unresolved. To further examine the issue, the first-degree relatives of 116 DSM III schizophrenic probands in our department were compared with those of an equal number of normal subjects, randomly selected and matched for age and sex. More than three fourths of the surviving relatives of each group were interviewed and rated according to DSM III criteria. Information of varying degrees of completeness was obtained about the remainder (surviving and dead). The gathered data were sufficiently detailed to provide general evidence that schizophrenia, and schizophrenia-related personality disorders were significantly more common in the first-degree relatives of DSM III schizophrenic probands than in the relatives of the controls. These findings suggest that even narrowly defined schizophrenia, such as that obtained by using DSM III criteria, has also a genetic component.","GDNF (glial-cell-line derived neurotrophic factor) is a potent neurotrophic factor for dopaminergic neurons. Neuropsychiatric diseases and their treatments are associated with alterations in the levels of both GDNF and its receptor family (GDNF family receptor alpha or GFRA). GFRA1, GFRA2 and GFRA3 are located in chromosomal regions with suggestive linkage to schizophrenia. In this study we analyzed polymorphisms located in all four known GFRA genes and examined association with schizophrenia and clozapine response. We examined SNPs across the genes GFRA1-4 in 219 matched case-control subjects, 85 small nuclear families and 140 schizophrenia patients taking clozapine for 6months. We observed that GFRA3 rs11242417 and GFRA1 rs11197557 variants were significantly associated with schizophrenia after combining results from both schizophrenia samples. Furthermore, we found an overtransmission of the G-C GFRA1 rs7920934-rs730357 haplotype to subjects with schizophrenia and association of A-T-G-G GFRA3 rs10036665-rs10952-rs11242417-rs7726580 with schizophrenia in the case-control sample. On the other hand, GFRA2 variants were not associated with schizophrenia diagnosis but subjects carrying T-G-G rs1128397-rs13250096-rs4567028 haplotype were more likely to respond to clozapine treatment. The statistical significance of results survived permutation testing but not Bonferroni correction. We also found nominally-significant evidence for interactions between GFRA1, 2 and 3 associated with schizophrenia and clozapine response, consistent with the locations of these three genes within linkage regions for schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
Both Text A and Text B discuss schizophrenia, primarily focusing on its genetic components and associations, albeit from different methodological perspectives. Text A investigates the prevalence of schizophrenia and related personality disorders among first-degree relatives of schizophrenic probands, thereby supporting the genetic linkage of the disorder. It uses DSM III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition) criteria to define and study schizophrenia, emphasizing the genetic aspect within a narrowly defined cohort.

Text B focuses on molecular genetics, looking at specific gene polymorphisms (GFRA genes) and their associations with schizophrenia and responses to specific treatments (e.g., clozapine). It also supports the idea of a genetic basis of schizophrenia by exploring gene variants and their correlation with the disease and drug response, which is consistent with the genetic exploration seen in Text A.

In both texts, despite different times and possibly advancements in research methodologies and understanding of the genetic foundations, the essential conceptualization of schizophrenia as a disease with significant genetic factors remains consistent. The research in Text B builds on the kind of foundational genetic associations that Text A discusses, reflecting an evolution in the method but not a fundamental change in the understanding of the disease as partially genetically driven. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a disorder potentially influenced by genetic elements has not drifted significantly between the periods."
26,Schizophrenia,"Many studies have demonstrated that in schizophrenia there are decreased rates of marriage, fertility and marital fertility. However, it is not clear whether this finding occurs as a social consequence of having the illness or is an inherent part of the illness. One would expect it to vary across cultures if it were being mediated by social and cultural factors.","Evidence is mounting that patient-reported experience can provide a valuable indicator of the quality of healthcare services. However, little is known about the relationship between the experiences of people with severe mental illness and the quality of care they receive. We conducted a study to examine the relationship between patient-reported experience and the quality of care provided to people with schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" refers to a severe mental illness characterized by disturbances in thought, perception, and behavior. Text A focuses on the social consequences and challenges faced by individuals with schizophrenia in terms of marriage and fertility, which underscores the societal and personal impact of the disorder. Text B examines the relationship between patient-reported experiences and the quality of healthcare services among those diagnosed with schizophrenia, placing a focus on healthcare quality and patient perspective. Despite different aspects being discussed in the two texts, the underlying concept and characterization of ""schizophrenia"" as a severe mental illness remain consistent. Thus, the word ""schizophrenia"" has not undergone significant semantic drift between the two texts."
27,Schizophrenia,"Higher level of urbanicity of place of birth and of place of residence at the time of illness onset has been shown to increase the risk for adult schizophrenia.

28,Schizophrenia,"Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common side effect of long-term medication with typical neuroleptics. TD presents itself by abnormal involuntary movements and may lead to a potentially disabling and chronic clinical course. A vast majority of patients suffering from schizophrenia are smokers. Smoking has been reported to induce the activity of the CYP1A2 enzyme, which is an established metabolic pathway within the disposition of antipsychotics. Recently, a C-->A genetic polymorphism in the first intron of the CYP1A2 gene was reported to influence CYP1A2 activity in smokers. Subsequently, a pharmacogenetic study in 85 U.S. patients with schizophrenia (44 smokers, 41 individuals with unknown smoking status) showed the C/C genotype to be associated with higher TD severity (measured by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, AIMS) than the A/C or A/A genotype. This finding prompted us to investigate whether this effect was also present in a larger German sample of 119 patients with schizophrenia (82 smokers, 37 individuals with unknown smoking status). However, we could not replicate the reported association. The median AIMS scores did not differ between individuals with the A/A, A/C, or C/C genotypes. In an additional analysis, we compared the genotypic and allelic distribution among individuals grouped according to the criteria established by Schooler and Kane [1982: Arch Gen Psychiatry 39:486-487] (persistent TD vs. absent TD). We did not observe a differential genotypic or allelic distribution between the two diagnostic groups. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that the C-->A polymorphism in the CYP1A2 gene is involved in the etiology of TD in the German population.","Selecting an appropriate working correlation structure is pertinent to clustered data analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) because an inappropriate choice will lead to inefficient parameter estimation. We investigate the well-known criterion of QIC for selecting a working correlation structure, and have found that performance of the QIC is deteriorated by a term that is theoretically independent of the correlation structures but has to be estimated with an error. This leads us to propose a correlation information criterion (CIC) that substantially improves the QIC performance. Extensive simulation studies indicate that the CIC has remarkable improvement in selecting the correct correlation structures. We also illustrate our findings using a data set from the Madras Longitudinal Schizophrenia Study.","###Answer:

29,Schizophrenia,"The term ""Paranoid Disorders"" is used vaguely and indiscriminately by many authors. This article provides brief working descriptions of a small number of paranoid/delusional conditions and, making reference to the author's series of monodelusional disorders, describes certain organic brain factors which appear to be surprisingly common in the background of these cases. It is hypothesized that the group of paranoid/delusional disorders may be linked to schizophrenia, especially of the paranoid type: however, in the paranoid/delusional disorders, hereditary schizophrenic factors may be weak and adverse organic brain factors relatively much stronger.","Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by cognitive deficits, and positive and negative symptoms. The development of effective pharmacological compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia has proven challenging and costly, with many compounds failing during clinical trials. Many failures occur due to disease heterogeneity and lack of predictive preclinical models and biomarkers that readily translate to humans during early characterization of novel antipsychotic compounds. Traditional early-phase trials consist of single- or multiple-dose designs aimed at determining the safety and tolerability of an investigational compound in healthy volunteers. However, by incorporating a translational approach employing methodologies derived from preclinical studies, such as EEG measures and imaging, into the traditional Phase I program, critical information regarding a compound's dose-response effects on pharmacodynamic biomarkers can be acquired. Furthermore, combined with the use of patients with stable schizophrenia in early-phase clinical trials, significant 'de-risking' and more confident 'go/no-go' decisions are possible. ","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason:
  - In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" primarily retains its meaning as a condition associated with severe mental disturbances. Text A explores its connection with paranoid and delusional disorders and suggests a potential genetic and organic brain factor basis. This indicates an understanding of schizophrenia as linked to a range of neurobiological and possibly genetic components, focusing specifically on its relation to other paranoid conditions.
  - Text B discusses the disorder from a more modern scientific research and drug development perspective, highlighting challenges in treating schizophrenia due to its heterogeneity and the complexity of its symptoms. It talks about cognitive deficits and other symptoms, which aligns with understanding schizophrenia as a severe, multifaceted mental health condition.
  - Both texts reflect an underlying consistency in treating schizophrenia as a complex and biologically rooted mental disorder. Despite differing focuses—one being more on diagnostic associations and the other on treatment and pharmaceutical research—the fundamental understanding of schizophrenia as a significant mental disorder remains consistent across the two time periods.

30,Schizophrenia,"This is a previously unpublished work by Alfred Adler that was written in 1936 as a preface to The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky. A theory of schizophrenia is described in which characteristic prepsychotic features, especially lack of social interest and oversensitivity to real and imagined slights, lead to increasing irrationalism and preoccupation with grandiose ideas. The establishment of a cooperative therapeutic relationship and the instilling of hope are presented as central factors for successful treatment.",The objective of this study was to apply a quality improvement collaborative to increase the number of physical health assessments conducted with consumers diagnosed with schizophrenia in adult community mental health services across Queensland.,"- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used to refer to a mental health condition, characterized in Text A by prepsychotic features and irrational thinking, and in Text B by the management of an identified group diagnosed with this condition for enhancing their physical health in a mental health setting. There is no significant change in the fundamental understanding or connotation of the term ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts; it remains consistent as a medical diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. The focus and application in context have shifted somewhat towards physical health considerations in contemporary care, but the underlying meaning of schizophrenia as a mental health disorder remains the same."
31,Schizophrenia,"Propagation and prolongation of rapid neuronal discharge underlies the epilepsies. However, episodic focal rapid neuronal discharges limited to discrete nuclei and pathways of the amygdala-hippocampal-septal-hypothalamic networks are the language of physiologic message systems for endocrine regulation and reproductive activities vital to the survival of the organism and the species. To prevent prolongation and propagation of physiologic pulsed excitation to areas outside specific networks and resultant epileptic seizures, these discharges must be limited in extent and time by powerful inhibitory processes. The nucleus accumbens, a unit of the extended amygdala, and the monoamines and GABA are components of the inhibitory networks that restrict physiologic rapid discharge in duration and in location. In parallel to the relationship of excessive neuronal excitation to epilepsy, evidence will be presented that excessive inhibition via one or more components of these inhibitory networks or diminished excitation underlies development of some psychoses, including schizophrenia.","Benzodiazepines are frequently long-term prescribed for the treatment of patients with severe mental illness. This prescribing practice is problematic because of well-described side effects including risk of dependence. We examined the efficacy of prolonged-release melatonin on objective and subjective sleep quality during benzodiazepine discontinuation and whether sleep variables were associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Eligible patients included adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder and long-term use of benzodiazepines in combination with antipsychotics. All participants gradually tapered the use of benzodiazepines after randomization to add-on treatment with melatonin versus placebo. Here we report a subsample of 23 patients undergoing sleep recordings (one-night polysomnography) and 55 patients participating in subjective sleep quality ratings. Melatonin had no effect on objective sleep efficiency, but significantly improved self-reported sleep quality. Reduced benzodiazepine dosage at the 24-week follow-up was associated with a significantly decreased proportion of stage 2 sleep. These results indicate that prolonged-release melatonin has some efficacy for self-reported sleep quality after gradual benzodiazepine dose reduction, and that benzodiazepine discontinuation is not associated with rebound insomnia in medicated patients with severe mental illness. However, these findings were limited by a small sample size and a low retention rate.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used to describe a severe mental illness related to disruptions or alterations in psychological function. Text A discusses the development of psychoses, including schizophrenia, as potentially arising from either excessive inhibition or diminished excitation in neuronal networks. Text B examines the management of schizophrenia along with other disorders, here specifically addressing issues related to sleep and medication (benzodiazepines and melatonin) in these patients. In both cases, schizophrenia is discussed within the context of psychiatric pathology and medical treatment, implying that the core understanding and application of the term ""schizophrenia"" in medical and psychological fields remain largely consistent across the two texts. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift observed for this term between the periods of these studies."
32,Schizophrenia,"The purpose of the study was to study the influence of life events on adolescent patients suffering from anorexia nervosa. Twenty one hospitalized adolescent inpatients with severe anorexia nervosa were compared with 79 adolescent nonanorectic psychiatric inpatients and 40 healthy adolescents for stressful life events throughout their lives. The nonanorectic patients suffered from schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorder or conduct disorder. The assessment of the contribution of life events to the development of anorexia and the control mental disorders was based on semistructured interviewing of the patients, their parents and the patients' therapists. The instrument used was that developed by Pfeffer. The anorectic patients showed significantly higher negative life event scores than healthy controls in all the areas of life events examined. In addition, they showed significantly more negative life events concerning parents than patients in the other psychiatric diagnostic categories. These findings have relevance for the growing literature on the association between eating disorders and certain forms of child abuse.","Monothematic delusional disorders are characterized by a single tenacious belief.

33,Schizophrenia,Serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) transmission may play an important role in the treatment and/or pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Previous studies reported that several atypical antipsychotic agents have high affinities for the 5-HT6 receptor. The 5-HT6 receptor gene polymorphism might contribute to the genetic background of this disorder. One hundred and fifty unrelated patients with schizophrenia and 150 unrelated healthy controls were genotyped for a biallelic polymorphism (267C/T) at the 5-HT6 receptor gene. No significant positive association between the 5-HT6 receptor genotype and schizophrenia was observed. Our results suggests that the 267C/T polymorphism of the 5-HT6 receptor gene may not be involved in the susceptibility to schizophrenia.,"Treatment continuity is a major challenge in the long-term management of patients with schizophrenia; poor patient adherence to antipsychotic drugs has been associated with negative clinical outcomes. Long-acting injectable therapies may improve adherence and lessen the risk for psychiatric-related relapse, often leading to rehospitalization and higher healthcare costs. Therefore, understanding the determinants of adherence to antipsychotics is critical in the management of patients with schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains its usage and context as a psychiatric disorder. Text A focuses on genetic studies related to schizophrenia and its potential links with serotonin receptors, specifically exploring the non-involvement of the 5-HT6 receptor gene polymorphism in schizophrenia susceptibility. Text B discusses the treatment and management challenges of schizophrenia, specifically addressing patient adherence to therapeutic regimens and the impact on clinical outcomes. Both texts clearly identify schizophrenia as a mental health condition, without divergence in meaning or connotation over time, suggesting a stable semantic usage of the word across the years represented by the texts."
34,Schizophrenia,"The nature of abnormalities of cerebral structure evident in schizophrenia on magnetic resonance imaging is considered in relation to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of the disorder. While schizophrenic patients showed increased ventricular volume, the extent of increase with age was comparable with that evident in controls and was unrelated to duration of illness. Conversely, cortical atrophy was evident only in patients, and this increased markedly with age and duration of illness. Such findings could be suggestive of two distinct pathophysiological processes in schizophrenia, but a schema for their reconciliation with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis is elaborated.","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a psychiatric disorder that can include symptoms of disorganized speech and thoughts with uncertain underlying mechanisms possibly linked to over-activated microglia. In this study, we used brain samples from sixteen donors with SCZ and thirteen control donors to assess the differential activation of microglia by quantifying density and 3D reconstruction of microglia stained with ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1). Our samples consisted of sections from the frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortical gray matter, subcortical white matter regions (SCWM), and included the anterior corpus callosum. In the first series of studies, we performed a density analysis followed by a spatial analysis to ascertain the microglial density, distribution, and soma size in SCZ brains. Second, we performed a series of morphological quantification techniques to investigate the arborization patterns of the microglia in SCZ. The results demonstrated an increase in microglia density in the cortical gray matter regions in SCZ cases, while in the SCWM, there was a significant increase in microglia density in the frontal and temporal, but not in the other brain regions of interest (ROIs). Spatial analysis using the ""nearest neighbor"" demonstrated that there was no effect in ""clustering"", but there were shorter distances between microglia seen in the SCZ cases. The morphological measures showed that there was a region-dependent increase in the microglia soma size in the SCZ cases while the Sholl analysis revealed a significant decrease in the microglia arborization in the SCZ cases across all the ROI's studied. An in-depth 3D reconstruction of microglia in Brodmann area 9 cortical region found that there was a significant association between age and reduced microglial arborization in the SCZ cases. This region-dependent age association can help determine whether longitudinal changes in microglial activation across age are brain region-dependent, which may point to potential therapeutic targets.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" refers clearly to a psychiatric disorder characterized by abnormalities affecting brain structure and functionality. Text A discusses contributions to schizophrenia from a neurodevelopmental perspective with findings related to cerebral abnormalities, while Text B focuses on advanced microglial involvement in schizophrenia, examining cellular characteristics and their implications. Although the methodologies and specific areas of research have evolved and become more complex, the fundamental understanding of schizophrenia as a psychiatric disorder rooted in brain pathology remains consistent between the two texts. Therefore, the semantic meaning of ""schizophrenia"" has remained unchanged over the years, continuing to denote a complex psychiatric condition with emphasis on cerebral and neurodevelopmental components."

- Target word: Schizophrenia

- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
From Text A and Text B, the use of the term ""schizophrenia"" appears consistent in context and meaning across both excerpts, despite being from different time periods. In Text A, schizophrenia is described with a focus on clinical findings and effects on patients—specifically related to brain structure (lateral ventricular size) and their prognosis. In Text B, the term is again used in a clinical context, focusing on the facilitation of communication between patients and clinicians regarding treatment. Both instances maintain the medical and psychiatric framing of schizophrenia as a disorder affecting mental health, without a shift towards any fundamentally different interpretation or usage. Thus, the semantic usage of ""schizophrenia"" remains unchanged between the texts."
37,Schizophrenia,"Spontaneous eye-blinking, a possible measure of central dopaminergic activity, was studied in 55 drug-free chronic schizophrenic patients subdivided by cerebral ventricular size. Blink rates were higher in schizophrenic patients than in normal control subjects, regardless of cerebral ventricle size. Neuroleptics lowered blink rates in patients with normal ventricles but did not affect blink rates in patients with large ventricles. Insofar as blinking is a dopaminergic parameter, these findings suggest that the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia is most relevant in patients with normal ventricles.","Neurodegenerative changes have been suggested to provide a basis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. T-817MA (1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl) ethoxy] propyl} azetidin-3-ol maleate) is a novel compound with neuroprotective and neurite-outgrowth effects, as elicited in rat primary cultured neurons.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: Both Text A and Text B discuss schizophrenia in the context of biological and physiological indicators, focusing on aspects like dopaminergic activity and neurodegenerative changes, respectively. Text A highlights the relationship between eye-blinking rates, a dopaminergic activity measure, and the pathology of schizophrenia. Text B discusses neurodegenerative changes as a contributing factor to the pathology of schizophrenia, alongside potential therapeutic intervention. While the focus in each text varies (dopaminergic effects in Text A vs. neurodegenerative changes and potential treatment in Text B), the fundamental perception and understanding of schizophrenia as a disorder deeply intertwined with neurological processes remains consistent across both texts. Thus, there is no significant change in the meaning or connotation of the word ""schizophrenia"" over the years indicated by these texts."
38,Schizophrenia,"Investigated and genetically analyzed were inheritance variants in 225 families of probands with different forms of development of child schizophrenia and 519 blood relatives as well as in 1714 relatives of the 2nd and 3rd grades. Child schizophrenia as seen from the viewpoint of the monogenic model of inheritance with total or partial penetrance of the ""major"" gene proved inconsistent with the characteristics of family history and population distributions in the disease. The multifactorial model appeared the most adequate to describe the susceptibility system. In the framework of this model the correlation between the susceptibility components specific for a clinical form could be derived from distinguishing between genotypic and environmental components. The data indicate that in malignant and slow progredient schizophrenia the probands were genotypically similar to a greater extent that they were in paroxysmal-progredient form, as revealed by the inheritance coefficient of the former group (28-35%) which was lower than that of the latter group (64%).",To explore shared pathogenesis between schizophrenia and polycistic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,"###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: The target word ""schizophrenia"" in both texts maintains its fundamental meaning relating to a psychiatric disorder characterized by disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions. Text A discusses the genetic analysis and forms of inheritance in child schizophrenia, focusing on the multifactorial model of the disease's inheritance and the specific susceptibility patterns. Text B, while mentioning schizophrenia in the context of exploring shared pathogenesis with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), still regards schizophrenia as a mental or psychiatric disorder, examining its potential relationship with another condition. Despite the different aspects of schizophrenia being studied (genetic patterns in Text A and pathogenesis link with PCOS in Text B), the underlying definition and contextual usage of ""schizophrenia"" as a psychiatric disorder have not changed. Hence, the semantic meaning of the word ""schizophrenia"" remains the same across both texts."

However, only several cases of juice-induced hyperkalemia have been reported that involved non-psychiatric, diabetic outpatients with renal compromise. We present a highly unusual case of a 66-year-old non-diabetic, schizophrenic woman with psychogenic polydipsia and normal renal function who developed hyperkalemia secondary to excessive orange juice consumption while an inpatient. In addition to demonstrating this previously undescribed medical comorbidity of schizophrenia, this case highlights the need for careful attention when communicating with both nursing and patients when managing psychogenic polydipsia.","Serotonin regulates a wide variety of brain functions and behaviors. Here, we synthesize previous findings that serotonin regulates executive function, sensory gating, and social behavior and that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior all share in common defects in these functions. It has remained unclear why supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D improve cognitive function and behavior in these brain disorders. Here, we propose mechanisms by which serotonin synthesis, release, and function in the brain are modulated by vitamin D and the 2 marine omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is transcriptionally activated by vitamin D hormone. Inadequate levels of vitamin D (∼70% of the population) and omega-3 fatty acids are common, suggesting that brain serotonin synthesis is not optimal. We propose mechanisms by which EPA increases serotonin release from presynaptic neurons by reducing E2 series prostaglandins and DHA influences serotonin receptor action by increasing cell membrane fluidity in postsynaptic neurons. We propose a model whereby insufficient levels of vitamin D, EPA, or DHA, in combination with genetic factors and at key periods during development, would lead to dysfunctional serotonin activation and function and may be one underlying mechanism that contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and depression. This model suggests that optimizing vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake may help prevent and modulate the severity of brain dysfunction.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the word ""schizophrenia"" is used within the context of discussing a neurological or psychiatric condition that affects individuals' mental health and behavior. Text A uses the term in the context of describing a patient's medical condition that influences her behavior and complicates other medical conditions (hyperkalemia due to psychogenic polydipsia). Text B discusses the broader neurochemical and physiological aspects of schizophrenia, focusing on its relationship with neurotransmitter synthesis and brain function, and how dietary supplements might influence these aspects. Despite the different focuses and details presented in each text, the underlying reference to schizophrenia as a mental health disorder remains consistent between the two texts, showing no significant semantic drift in how the term is applied."
40,Schizophrenia,"This study investigated racial differences in the prescription of psychopharmacologic treatments to individuals with schizophrenia. Data were derived from a patient survey and medical record review for 344 persons with schizophrenia recruited from outpatient psychiatric facilities in two States in the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team study. African-Americans were three times more likely to receive depot antipsychotic medications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68-5.01) and 76 percent less likely to receive new-generation antipsychotic medications (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12-0.46), compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Chlorpromazine-equivalent antipsychotic dosages did not differ significantly between African-American and Caucasian patients. Compared to Caucasians, a larger proportion of African-Americans received antiparkinsonian medications (63% vs. 48%, chi2 = 7.01; df = 1; p = 0.008), but African-Americans were less than half as likely to receive adjunctive psychopharmacologic treatments (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.27-0.71). Pronounced racial variations in the psychopharmacologic management of schizophrenia in typical clinical practice settings were observed and persisted when analyses were adjusted for selected patient demographic and clinical characteristics. A prospective, longitudinal evaluation is warranted to determine whether the observed patterns of prescribing are associated with poorer therapeutic outcomes in minority patients.","Schizophrenia is a severe highly heritable mental disorder. Genetic polymorphisms of dopaminergic pathways are related to pathogenesis of drug response. Hyperprolactinemia (HPRL), a common adverse effect of antipsychotics, is attributed to blockade of dopamine D2 receptors. Ankyrin Repeat and Kinase Domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene is closely related to Dopamine Receptor D2 type (DRD2) gene functioning. We examined whether the functional polymorphism rs2734849 in the ANKK1 gene is associated with antipsychotic-induced HPRL.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
The usage of the target word ""schizophrenia"" in both Text A and Text B revolves around its identification as a mental health disorder, specifically focusing on the aspects of treatment and genetic factors influencing the condition. In Text A, the discussion is about the disparities in the treatment options and outcomes for schizophrenia among different racial groups, focusing on how medications are prescribed differently among African-Americans compared to Caucasians. Text B delves into the genetic research aspects of schizophrenia, looking at how genetic polymorphisms, particularly those affecting dopamine pathways, influence responses to antipsychotic drugs and the emergence of side effects like hyperprolactinemia. 

Both texts, although approaching schizophrenia from different angles—one from a clinical practice perspective and the other from a genetic research angle—still fundamentally treat ""schizophrenia"" as a severe mental disorder requiring medical attention. There is no significant shift in the fundamental meaning or connotation of the term ""schizophrenia"" between these contexts. The discussions in both texts underscore the medical and scientific understanding of schizophrenia, maintaining a consistent use of the term in relation to a mental health condition."
41,Schizophrenia,"Amino acid metabolism in endogenous psychoses has been discussed in relation to monoamine synthesis. There are no consistent findings which prove altered monoamine syntheses to be the primary change. Our finding, which suggests decreased amino acid transport across the blood-brain barrier in schizophrenia, does not necessarily mean an insufficient amino acid supply to the brain. Several lines of investigation have shown the possibility of the involvement of glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Our recent finding of decreased CSF asparagine concentration in schizophrenia and its positive correlation with the response to neuroleptics may support this hypothesis. Recently, free D-serine, an allosteric agonist on NMDA-receptor, has been reported to exist in the rat brain, suggesting that D-serine is an intrinsic ligand. The pathogeneses of endogenous psychoses might be studied in terms of disturbed metabolism of amino acid, as allosteric regulater of neuro-receptor, as well as neurotransmitter and precursor of monoamines.","Previous studies show increased antibody levels to bovine casein in some individuals with schizophrenia. The immunogenicity of specific domains of bovine casein varies among people with milk sensitivities and thus could vary among different neuropsychiatric disorders. Using ELISAs and immunoblotting, we characterized IgG class antibody specificity to whole bovine casein and to the alpha(s), beta, and kappa subunits in individuals with recent onset psychosis (n=95), long-term schizophrenia (n=103), and non-psychiatric controls (n=65). In both patient groups, we found elevated IgG to casein proteins, particularly to whole casein and the alpha(s) subunit (p<or=0.0001). Odds ratios of casein seroprevalence for recent onset psychosis (age-, gender-, race-, smoking-adjusted) were significant for whole casein (8.13, p<or=0.0001), and the alpha(s) (7.89, p<or=0.0001), beta (5.23, p<or=0.001) and kappa (5.70, p<or=0.0001) subunits. Odds ratios for long-term schizophrenia were significant for whole casein (7.85, p<or=0.0001), and the alpha(s) (4.78, p<or=0.003) and kappa (4.92, p<or=0.004) subunits. Within the recent onset group, odds ratios were particularly significant for a subgroup of people with psychotic disorders that included major depressive disorders (8.22-16.48, p<or=0.0001). In a different recent onset subgroup (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders), PANSS scores for negative symptoms were correlated with casein antibody levels for the alpha(s) and kappa subunits (p<or=0.001-0.01). Immunoblotting patterns also exhibited group specificity, with kappa predominant in recent onset and alpha(s) in schizophrenia (Fisher's Exact Test, p<or=0.001). The elevated IgG and unique patterns of antibody specificity to bovine casein among diagnostic groups provide a rationale for clinical trials to evaluate efficacies of dietary modifications in individuals with neuropsychiatric diseases.","- Label: Changed
- Reason:
The context and implications surrounding the usage of ""schizophrenia"" show considerable evolution between Text A and Text B. In Text A, the focus is primarily on the biochemical aspects, exploring amino acid transport, neurotransmitter synthesis, and the metabolic implications in schizophrenia. This portrays schizophrenia in the framework of biochemical imbalances and neurochemical alterations within the brain.

In contrast, Text B shifts the perspective towards an immunological and dietary connection in schizophrenia. The text discusses elevated IgG antibodies to bovine casein in patients with schizophrenia and different immunogenic responses based on the subunits of casein. This novel angle introduces the hypothesis that dietary factors and immune responses play a significant role in the expression of schizophrenia, expanding its definition and treatment considerations beyond the traditional neurochemical models.

The transformation from a strictly biochemical model to an integrative view that includes immunological and dietary factors constitutes a significant semantic drift in the conceptual understanding and discussion of schizophrenia over time."
42,Schizophrenia,"The authors studied 15 men who committed matricide. The majority were diagnosed as having chronic schizophrenia and had been living alone with their mothers. Other diagnoses included substance-induced psychosis and impulse disorders. Specific psychodynamic and environmental factors can be identified for each diagnostic category. The authors conclude that the matricidal impulse evolves through successive stages of psychological development; therefore, the motives for matricide are varied and correlate with the level of psychological development or regression.","A sub-population analysis of 325 patients with agitation (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component [PEC] score > or = 15 and < or = 32; score of > or = 4 on > or = 2 items) associated with schizophrenia in a randomized, double-blind study investigating the efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular (IM) aripiprazole 9.75 mg, IM haloperidol 6.5 mg, or IM placebo and the transition to oral therapy.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts A and B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used within the context of discussing the psychiatric condition affecting individuals' mental health. Text A references ""chronic schizophrenia"" as a primary diagnosis in a study involving individuals who committed matricide, focusing on psychological aspects and development. Text B uses the term ""schizophrenia"" in a clinical trial setting, examining the treatment response for patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia, emphasizing the medical and therapeutic response to the condition. In both cases, though the focus and application vary (psychological analysis vs. therapeutic efficacy), the underlying meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a mental health disorder remains consistent across the two texts. The semantic meaning of schizophrenia referring to a category of psychiatric illness continues to be relevant and unchanged between the texts from the different time frames."
43,Schizophrenia,"Suppose the number of 2 x 2 tables is large relative to the average table size, and the observations within a given table are dependent, as occurs in longitudinal or family-based case-control studies. We consider fitting regression models to the odds ratios using table-level covariates. The focus is on methods to obtain valid inferences for the regression parameters beta when the dependence structure is unknown. In this setting, Liang (1985, Biometrika 72, 678-682) has shown that inference based on the noncentral hypergeometric likelihood is sensitive to misspecification of the dependence structure. In contrast, estimating functions based on the Mantel-Haenszel method yield consistent estimators of beta. We show here that, under the estimating function approach, Wald's confidence interval for beta performs well in multiplicative regression models but unfortunately has poor coverage probabilities when an additive regression model is adopted. As an alternative to Wald inference, we present a Mantel-Haenszel quasi-likelihood function based on integrating the Mantel-Haenszel estimating function. A simulation study demonstrates that, in medium-sized samples, the Mantel-Haenszel quasi-likelihood approach yields better inferences than other methods under an additive regression model and inferences comparable to Wald's method under a multiplicative model. We illustrate the use of this quasi-likelihood method in a study of the familial risk of schizophrenia.","This study aimed to examine the association of lifetime abstention of sexual intercourse with lifetime Axis I and II psychiatric disorders, attempted suicide, past-year Axis I psychiatric disorder, past-year medical condition, past-year obesity, health-related quality of life, and health service use in middle-aged and older adults in the United States. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in the 2004-2005 Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Analyses were performed for the subsample aged 40 years and older (males = 14,427; female = 19,860). Lifetime abstinence from sexual intercourse, sociodemographic variables, prevalence of lifetime Axis I and II DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, and attempted suicide, past-year Axis I psychiatric disorders, 14 medical conditions, obesity, health-related quality of life, and health service use were obtained. The prevalence of lifetime abstinence from sexual intercourse was 0.90 % (0.88 % for males; 1.00 % for females). The adjusted risks of any lifetime and past-year Axis I disorder, any lifetime and past-year substance-use disorders, lifetime alcohol-use disorder, lifetime and past-year alcohol-abuse disorder, lifetime nicotine dependence, lifetime drug-use disorder, and lifetime drug-abuse disorder were significantly lower for who abstained from sexual intercourse than for those who did not. However, those who abstained from sexual intercourse were more likely to have a diagnosis of obesity and lifetime avoidant and dependent personality disorders. The unadjusted risk of dysthymic disorder was also significantly greater for those who abstained from sexual intercourse. Results indicate that the effect of lifetime absence of sexual intercourse on psychiatric disorders is mixed.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used to discuss aspects of mental health relative to research studies and data analysis, focusing on its role as a psychiatric disorder. Text A discusses schizophrenia in the context of a study on familial risk using statistical models to analyze odds ratios and inferences related to schizophrenia. Text B examines it as part of a broader study on lifetime abstinence from sexual intercourse and its associative comorbidities, including various psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. In both cases, ""schizophrenia"" retains its primary concept as a type of serious mental illness characterized by disordered thinking, emotions, and behavior, showing no evidence of significant semantic drift in usage or connotation over the studied period."
44,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is associated with language-related dysfunction. A previous study [Schizophr. Res. 59 (2003c) 159] has shown that this abnormality is present at the level of automatic discrimination of change in speech sounds, as revealed by magnetoencephalographic recording of auditory mismatch field in response to across-category change in vowels. Here, we investigated the neuroanatomical substrate for this physiological abnormality. Thirteen patients with schizophrenia and 19 matched control subjects were examined using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate both mismatch field strengths in response to change between vowel /a/ and /o/, and gray matter volumes of Heschl's gyrus (HG) and planum temporale (PT). The magnetic global field power of mismatch response to change in phonemes showed a bilateral reduction in patients with schizophrenia. The gray matter volume of left planum temporale, but not right planum temporale or bilateral Heschl's gyrus, was significantly smaller in patients with schizophrenia compared with that in control subjects. Furthermore, the phonetic mismatch strength in the left hemisphere was significantly correlated with left planum temporale gray matter volume in patients with schizophrenia only. These results suggest that structural abnormalities of the planum temporale may underlie the functional abnormalities of fundamental language-related processing in schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is associated with a significant risk of suicide: 40-50% of schizophrenic patients report suicidal ideation at some point in their lives, and 4-13% eventually commit suicide. In order to be able to predict and prevent suicide in schizophrenic patients, it is necessary to investigate and characterise suicide victims who meet the criteria for psychotic disorders and risk factors.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: 
Both Text A and Text B discuss schizophrenia primarily from a medical perspective, focusing on different aspects of the condition and its consequences, but the core meaning and implications associated with the term remain consistent. Text A explores the physiological and neuroanatomical anomalies in language processing among individuals with schizophrenia, utilizing methodologies like magnetoencephalography and MRI. Meanwhile, Text B discusses the severe outcomes associated with schizophrenia, such as the high risk and prevalence of suicidal ideation and actions among those diagnosed. While the focus of the studies is different – one being more on the cognitive dysfunction and another on mental health risk – both texts use the term ""schizophrenia"" in a similar clinical and pathological context, implying a psychiatric disorder characterized by specific symptoms that affect cognitive and emotional functioning. Therefore, the semantic use of ""schizophrenia"" has not significantly drifted between the contexts provided in the two texts."
45,Schizophrenia,"The frontal lobes can be subdivided into major functional neuroanatomical domains, which, when injured, surgically destroyed, or reduced in activity or volume, give rise to signature pathological and psychiatric symptomology. A review of case reports and over 50 years of research, including magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography scans, indicates that apathy, ""blunted"" schizophrenia, major depression, and aphasic-perseverative disturbance of speech and thought are associated with left lateral as well as bilateral frontal (and striatal) abnormalities. Impulsiveness, confabulatory verbosity, grandiosity, increased sexuality, and mania are associated with right frontal (as well as bilateral) disturbances. Gegenhalten, catatonia, and disturbances of ""will"" are indicative of medial frontal injuries. Disinhibitory states and obsessive-compulsive perseverative abnormalities are more frequently observed with orbital frontal lobe dysfunction, including frontal-striatal disturbances. These associations, however, are not always clear-cut as patients with the same diagnosis may demonstrate different symptoms that may be due to an additional abnormality in a different region of the brain. Moreover, as the frontal subdivisions are richly interconnected, and as frontal lobe abnormalities are not always discrete or well localized, a wide array of seemingly divergent waxing and waning symptoms may be manifest, sometimes simultaneously, including manic depression and what has been referred to as the ""frontal lobe personality.""","A critical facet of motivation is effort-based decision making, which refers to the mental processes involved in deciding whether a potential reward is worth the effort. To advance understanding of how individuals with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder utilize cost-benefit information to guide choice behavior, this study aimed to characterize individual differences in the computations associated with effort-based decision making.","###Answer:
- **Target word**: Schizophrenia
- **Text A**: Discusses various psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia in relation to abnormalities in specific brain areas. It describes ""blunted"" schizophrenia associating it with apathy, major depression, and other disturbances due to frontal lobe (and striatal) abnormalities.
- **Text B**: References schizophrenia in the context of a study on effort-based decision-making. The study explores how individuals with schizophrenia use cost-benefit information to guide their choices, focusing on the mental processes involved.

- **Label**: Unchanged
- **Reason**: In both Text A and Text B, the portrayal of schizophrenia remains consistent within the psychological and neurobiological domains. Text A provides a broader view on the neurological associations with schizophrenia, while Text B discusses a specific aspect of cognitive processing in schizophrenia. Both texts engage with the disorder from a perspective that emphasizes brain function and mental processes, indicating the core concept and understanding of ""schizophrenia"" has essentially retained its meaning related to a complex psychiatric condition characterized by specific cognitive and functional abnormalities. Thus, the semantic drift in the meaning of the word 'schizophrenia' across the texts appears unchanged – still fundamentally linked to a neurological and psychiatric framework."
46,Schizophrenia,"The efficacy of the S2-antagonist ritanserin has not yet been clarified satisfactorily. In an open indication finding study to generate new hypotheses concerning its possible therapeutic application carried out in the psychiatric university clinic 25 patients (10 patients with vitalized neurotic depression (ICD No. 296.1), 7 with florid depressively tinged schizophrenia (ICD No. 295.3)) were treated with an average of 15.5 mg/day of ritanserin for a period of 4 weeks. Alterations in the psychopathological findings were documented by means of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and the psychopathological findings (page 4) of the AMDP system. The results suggest that ritanserin improves depressive rather than schizophrenic symptomatology. In 4 of the 7 schizophrenic patients of our study an intensification of the psychotic symptomatology could even be observed. On the basis of our open study findings ritanserin could be classified as a substance with antidepressive effects, with a low incidence of side-effects and a rapid onset of action. In placebo controlled clinical studies this indication should be examined in different patient groups.","Administration of certain drugs (for example, antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antipsychotics) may occasionally affect myocardial repolarization and cause prolongation of the QT interval. We performed a whole genome association study of drug-induced QT prolongation after 14 days of treatment in a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a novel atypical antipsychotic, iloperidone, in patients with schizophrenia. We identified DNA polymorphisms associated with QT prolongation in six loci, including the CERKL and SLCO3A1 genes. Each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) defined two genotype groups associated with a low mean QT change (ranging from -0.69 to 5.67 ms depending on the SNP) or a higher mean QT prolongation (ranging from 14.16 to 17.81 ms). The CERKL protein is thought to be part of the ceramide pathway, which regulates currents conducted by various potassium channels, including the hERG channel. It is well established that inhibition of the hERG channel can prolong the QT interval. SLCO3A1 is thought to play a role in the translocation of prostaglandins, which have known cardioprotective properties, including the prevention of torsades de pointes. Our findings also point to genes involved in myocardial infarction (PALLD), cardiac structure and function (BRUNOL4) and cardiac development (NRG3). Results of this pharmacogenomic study provide new insight into the clinical response to iloperidone, developed with the goal of directing therapy to those patients with the optimal benefit/risk ratio.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In the provided texts, the usage of the word ""schizophrenia"" consistently refers to the mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions. Both texts discuss the treatment and effects of medications on patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, albeit in different contexts. Text A focuses on the effects of the drug ritanserin, primarily noting its impact on depressive symptoms rather than typical schizophrenic symptoms, and describes an observed intensification of psychotic symptoms in some schizophrenic patients. Text B explores the genetic factors that might influence the response to the drug iloperidone in treating schizophrenia, particularly its effects on the QT interval in cardiac function as part of a pharmacogenomic study.

In neither text has the fundamental meaning of ""schizophrenia"" shifted from its medical definition as a psychiatric disorder. The context in which it is discussed - clinical trials and medication efficacy - remains within the medical and therapeutic framework typical of discussions surrounding this term over time. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift in the term ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts, and its meaning remains ""Unchanged."""
47,Schizophrenia,"In summary, we have observed that drugs of abuse, which can cause schizophrenia-like paranoia, alter striatal and accumbens NT systems in a similar, dramatic fashion. The NT responses to these drugs, in particular METH, are mediated by activation of DA D1 receptors. We have observed that NMDA-type glutamate receptors are essential for the D1-NT interaction. NMDA receptors are selective, since they do not contribute to the antagonistic effects of DA D2 receptors on NT activity. This observation suggests that NT responses to D1 and D2 regulation are mediated through separate and distinct mechanisms. Finally, we found that the presence of METH dramatically reduces striatal NT release, which most likely leads to NT accumulation in nerve terminals and the observed increase in NT tissue level. The blockade of NT release by a psychotogenic drug, such as METH, is consistent with the hypothesis that NT has antipsychotic activity and a decrease in its release may contribute to some forms of schizophrenia similar to that caused by intense use of the stimulants of abuse.","Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal outcome parameter in research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). While the concept remains somewhat ill-defined, there is now little dispute that the patients' personal goals deserve foremost consideration during the course of treatment as the primary aim of treatment should be relief from individual despair, which is related but by no means synonymous to symptom reduction. Studies using generic (ie, illness-unspecific) instruments have confirmed poor QoL in OCD patients across a wide range of domains, especially with respect to social, work role functioning, and mental health aspects. Scores are sometimes as low as those obtained by patients with schizophrenia. Depression and obsessions are the symptom clusters that most strongly contribute to low QoL. Findings from a novel survey of 105 OCD participants point to multiple daily life problems, poor work status, and tense social networks in these patients. In order to achieve therapeutic success and improve QoL, functional problems at work and comorbid disorders such as secondary depression and physical impairments should be targeted. While successful treatment sometimes positively impacts well-being, in some studies symptom decline did not translate into improved QoL.","###Label:

###Reason:
From the provided texts, the semantic use of the word ""schizophrenia"" doesn't seem to have shifted significantly across the two time periods, suggesting no semantic drift. In Text A, ""schizophrenia"" is used in a technical context, related directly to the psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms like paranoia, which can be simulated or exacerbated by drug abuse (specifically by METH in the text). The text discusses the neurochemical dynamics associated with schizophrenia-like symptoms triggered by drugs. In Text B, while the primary focus is on the quality of life in OCD patients, ""schizophrenia"" is mentioned as a comparator to illustrate the severity of the decline in the quality of life among patients with severe mental disorders. The usage in Text B retains the standard medical and psychiatric framing of schizophrenia as a severe mental health issue, paralleling that in Text A. Thus, the term ""schizophrenia"" retains its meaning associated with a mental health disorder characterized by specific psychiatric symptoms and impacts on quality of life across both texts."
48,Schizophrenia,"Volitional auditory imagery and spontaneous imagery/fantasy are examined in schizophrenic vs. nonschizophrenic psychiatric inpatients. Imaginal aspects of schizophrenia are also studied with regard to concurrent presence or absence of hallucination.

In this paper, we report evidence that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around interleukin 3 (IL3) are associated with the disease in the Irish Study of High-Density Schizophrenia Families (ISHDSF), the Irish Case-Control Study of Schizophrenia (ICCSS) and the Irish Trio Study of Schizophrenia (ITRIO). The associations are sex-specific and depend on the family history (FH) of schizophrenia. In all three samples, rs31400 shows female-specific and FH-dependent associations (P=0.0062, 0.0647 and 0.0284 for the ISHDSF, ICCSS and ITRIO, respectively). Several markers have similar associations in one or two of the three samples. In haplotype analyses, identical risk and protective haplotypes are identified in the ISHDSF and ITRIO samples in several multimarker combinations. For ICCSS, the same haplotypes are implicated; however, the risk haplotypes observed in the family samples become protective. Several significant markers, rs440970, rs31400 and rs2069803, are located in and around known estrogen response elements, promoter and enhancer of the IL3 gene. They may explain the sex-specific associations and be functional for the expression of IL3 gene.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""schizophrenia"" is discussed predominantly in the context of psychological or psychiatric symptomatology, focusing on aspects such as auditory imagery, hallucinations, and imaginal function within schizophrenic versus non-schizophrenic individuals. The emphasis is largely on the cognitive and perceptual phenomena associated with schizophrenia, reflecting a clinical and psychological perspective of that era.

In contrast, Text B delves into the genetic and biological underpinnings of schizophrenia, particularly the associations of specific genetic markers on chromosome 5q21-33 and their implications concerning the disease. It specifically points out the role of interleukin genes and their associations with schizophrenia, analyzing their impact based on sex and family history, and considering cellular and molecular aspects.

This shift from a predominantly psychological discussion to a genetic and biological understanding over time illustrates a substantial semantic drift where ""schizophrenia"" not only implies the symptoms and psychological impact but extensively encompasses genetic factors responsible for its pathogenesis, emphasizing a more holistic and bio-psycho-social approach to understanding and addressing the disease."
49,Schizophrenia,"Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor, is essential for the differentiation of the midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons; however, its function in adult midbrain DA neurons has not been determined. The present study compared regional brain levels of catecholamines and spontaneous and pharmacologically induced locomotor behaviors between mice heterozygous for the Nurr1-null allele (+/-) and wild type (+/+) littermates. The Nurr1 +/- mice had significantly lower levels of DA in whole brain, midbrain, prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, although no significant differences were observed in the striatum, olfactory bulb or hippocampus. Nurr1 +/- mice displayed significantly greater locomotor activity in a novel open field and after saline injection with no significant difference in activity after treatment with amphetamine (2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg) or MK 801 (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg). A similar elevation in locomotor activity was observed in Nurr1 +/- mice at 35 days old as was found in 70 days old adults. These data demonstrate that the loss of a single Nurr1 allele results in reduced DA levels in mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways and increased locomotor activity in response to mild stress. The involvement of Nurr1 in DA neurotransmission and the implications for schizophrenia are discussed.","Previous studies have tried to determine the factors causing greater use of health resources by patients with mental disorders. These studies have essentially focused on socio-economic variables. Nevertheless, many other variables, such as social functioning, have not yet been explored. This study aims to assess the effect of social functioning on mental health service use in a sample of patients with severe mental disorder (schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders or bipolar affective disorder) in an area of Spain. The Social Functioning Scale (SFS) was administered to 172 family members of patients with a severe mental disorder who were receiving care at a community mental health unit. Analysis of bivariate logistic regression identified specific areas as predictors of the use of mental health resources over a 12-month follow-up period. The overall social functioning score predicted need for hospital admissions. In addition, interpersonal behaviour had a major role in the number of outpatient visits, while social isolation significantly predicted the need for hospitalization. These results point out the necessity for including psychosocial variables, such as social functioning in current mental health resource use models. ","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" continues to designate a severe mental disorder associated with various cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions. Text A focuses on the biological and genetic aspects of schizophrenia, particularly how variations in the Nurr1 gene affect dopamine neurotransmission which has implications for schizophrenia. Text B, while not directly examining the biological basis, looks at schizophrenia in the context of how social functioning affects the use of mental health resources by patients diagnosed with the condition, including other severe disorders like bipolar affective disorder. 

Though the focus of the texts is different—one being more molecular and the other more socio-economic—the underlying understanding of ""schizophrenia"" as a complex psychiatric disorder remains consistent. Neither text diverges into interpreting schizophrenia in a fundamentally new light but rather builds upon the established medical framework by examining different facets of its manifestation and impact on individuals' lives. Thus, the term has not undergone significant semantic drift as both texts support its consistent medical definition over time."
50,Schizophrenia,"Pharmacological intervention is the commonest mode of managing patients with schizophrenia. Both clinicians and patients are concerned that antipsyohotic drugs are costly and contribute to poor drug compliance in India. This study compared the equivalent doses of antipsychotic drugs and their costs across brands.

Numerous brands and a 2-2-1/2 fold difference in cost raises many concerns including that of drug bioavailability.

51,Schizophrenia,Bipolar affective disorder patients often show cognitive deficits that are similar to those found in schizophrenia patients. Theory of mind (the ability to understand others' mental states) is compromised in currently ill schizophrenia patients. This study aimed to establish whether similar deficits are found in bipolar patients.,"A 'sense of self' is essentially the ability to distinguish between self-generated and external stimuli. It consists of at least two very basic senses: a sense of agency and a sense of ownership. Disturbances seem to provide a basic deficit in many psychiatric diseases. The aim of our study was to manipulate those qualities separately in 28 patients with schizophrenia (14 auditory hallucinators and 14 non-hallucinators) and 28 healthy controls (HC) and to investigate the effects on the topographies and the power of the event-related potential (ERP). We performed a 76-channel EEG while the participants performed the task as in our previous paper. We computed ERPs and difference maps for the conditions and compared the amount of agency and ownership between the HC and the patients. Furthermore, we compared the global field power and the topographies of these effects. Our data showed effects of agency and ownership in the healthy controls and the hallucinator group and to a lesser degree in the non-hallucinator group. We found a reduction of the N100 during the presence of agency, and a bilateral temporal negativity related to the presence of ownership. For the agency effects, we found significant differences between HC and the patients. Contrary to the expectations, our findings were more pronounced in non-hallucinators, suggesting a more profoundly disturbed sense of agency compared to hallucinators. A contemporary increase of global field power in both patient groups indicates a compensatory recruitment of other mechanisms not normally associated with the processing of agency and ownership.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the concept of 'schizophrenia' retains a focus on cognitive and perceptual disturbances associated with the disorder. Text A discusses cognition and theory of mind deficits in schizophrenia patients, while Text B explores disturbances in senses of agency and ownership, both crucial cognitive aspects underpinning schizophrenia. Although the specific focus and methodologies differ — Text A on theory of mind, and Text B on ERP measures of agency and ownership disturbances — the core characteristic of schizophrenia as relating to significant disruptions in mental processing and cognitive functions remains consistent across both texts. This indicates that the semantic essence of 'schizophrenia' concerning its description as a mental health disorder characterized by complex cognitive disturbances has not undergone significant changes."
52,Schizophrenia,"Between 1989 and 1997, the Food and Drug Administration approved four new-generation antipsychotic medications for use in the treatment of schizophrenia. This article examines factors associated with the use of new antipsychotic medications as compared with traditional antipsychotic medications from patient interviews, medical records, and a physician survey administered at schizophrenia treatment sites around the country as part of the Schizophrenia Care and Assessment Program. The following variables were significantly associated with a higher probability of receiving an atypical antipsychotic medication in multiple regression analysis at p < .05: female, younger age, younger age of onset, non-African American, having a higher Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Negative Syndrome subscale score. Some physician characteristics were statistically significant in the bivariate results but not in the multivariate analyses. Access to new atypical antipsychotic medications is dependent on more than clinical characteristics. In particular, barriers to access may exist for African Americans. Physician access to information about advances in drug therapies also may play a substantial role in the rate of diffusion of new medications.","PLP1 is one of the major myelin-related genes. A large body of expression-based studies showed significantly lower levels of the PLP1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts in schizophrenia. Moreover, one family-based study identified a weak association signal in a male subset using 487 Chinese family trios. We carried out a population-based association study between PLP1 and schizophrenia in 1,640 subjects. Our data does not support genetic variation in close vicinity or within PLP1 locus as a susceptibility factor.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used to refer to the psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and diminished emotional expression. Text A discusses the treatment of schizophrenia with new-generation antipsychotic medications, exploring clinical factors and issues concerning access to these medications. Text B investigates the genetic aspects of schizophrenia, focusing on the gene PLP1 and its association with the disorder. Although the context of the discussions differs—with Text A concentrating on treatment via pharmaceuticals and Text B on genetic susceptibility—the underlying reference to ""schizophrenia"" as a psychiatric disorder remains consistent. Neither text deviates from the established medical understanding of schizophrenia as a distinct mental health condition, showing no significant semantic drift in the term's usage over the time span considered."
53,Schizophrenia,Abnormality of the V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT1) may be a predisposing factor in schizophrenia. Recent evidence supporting this hypothesis showed decreased AKT1 protein levels in patients with schizophrenia and significant association of AKT1 haplotypes according to the transmission disequilibrium test.,"Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that infections during pregnancy increase the risk of offspring developing Schizophrenia, Autism, Depression and Bipolar Disorder and have implicated interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a causal agent. However, other cytokines have been associated with the developmental origins of psychiatric disorders; therefore, it remains to be established whether elevating IL-6 is sufficient to alter the trajectory of neural development. Furthermore, most rodent studies have manipulated the maternal immune system at mid-gestation, which affects the stem cells and progenitors in both the primary and secondary germinal matrices. Therefore, a question that remains to be addressed is whether elevating IL-6 when the secondary germinal matrices are most active will affect brain development. Here, we have increased IL-6 from postnatal days 3-6 when the secondary germinal matrices are rapidly expanding. Using Nestin-Cre","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used to discuss aspects of the underlying biological or neurodevelopmental factors that predispose or contribute to the condition. Text A highlights the role of the AKT1 gene and protein levels in individuals with schizophrenia, focusing on genetic predisposition. Text B, while being broader in scope by discussing other psychiatric disorders as well, still focuses on biological causes, specifically prenatal infections and cytokine (IL-6) levels affecting the likelihood of developing schizophrenia among other conditions.

Despite slight differences in focus within the biomedical domain (one on genetic markers, the other on prenatal environments), the core conceptualization of ""schizophrenia"" as a complex, biologically-influenced mental health condition remains largely consistent between the texts. Neither extracts indicate a shift towards an entirely different meaning or connotation of the term, such as a change to represent a cultural or non-medical perspective. Therefore, the semantic usage of ""schizophrenia"" is labeled as ""Unchanged."""
54,Schizophrenia,"Refractory schizophrenia has limited therapeutic options. Schizophrenia can be considered to be a disease of abnormal synaptic plasticity. Neuregulin is a member of the epithelial growth factor family, which induces growth and differentiation of epithelial, glial and muscle cells in culture. Neuregulin has been documented to be important in synaptic plasticity. The important role of neuregulin in synaptic plasticity as well as its developmental role have increasingly been documented recently. The actions of neuregulin are mediated through ERB receptors. Neuregulin can bind directly to erbB3 and erbB4 receptors and receptor heterodimerization allows neuregulin dependent activation of erbB2. The role of Erb 2 could make it possible to use the monoclonal antibody against it for improving the synaptic plasticity through the action on neuregulin. The use of trastuzumab (Her2 antibody) as targeted therapy is well documented in metastatic carcinoma of breast. Also intra-thecal administration of trastuzumab has been reported to be safe in carcinomatous meningitis. Here it is being hypothesized that intra-thecal administration of trastuzumab would improve synaptic plasticity there by making refractory schizophrenia amenable to treatment.","Schizophrenia is a highly disabling disorder characterized by positive and negative symptoms and poor functioning in almost every area of life. Multiple antipsychotics have demonstrated varying levels of efficacy in reducing symptoms in schizophrenia, but adverse effects are common, adherence to medication is low, and relapse rates are high. Psychosocial interventions used in conjunction with antipsychotic pharmacotherapy may help improve treatment outcomes. This Performance Improvement CME activity focuses on individualizing treatment for schizophrenia, assessing treatment adherence, minimizing medication-induced adverse events, and preventing relapse, for children, adolescents, and adults with schizophrenia.","###Label:

In both Text A and Text B, the concept of ""schizophrenia"" consistently refers to a complex mental disorder. Text A focuses on a molecular and synaptic perspective, suggesting innovative therapeutic strategies targeting synaptic plasticity, while Text B addresses a more clinical and treatment-oriented perspective, emphasizing symptom management, medication adherence, and psychosocial interventions. Despite these differences in focus, the fundamental understanding of schizophrenia as a serious psychological disorder remains stable. Both texts emphasize new modalities in the treatment and understanding of schizophrenia, thus indicating no significant semantic drift in the use of the word over the given period."
55,Schizophrenia,"Initial schizophrenia was observed in 15 out of 93 out-patients being treated for cephalea in a Regional Neuropsychiatrical Department. Certain abnormal phenomena in the field of consciousness and body sensations are typical of coenasthetic schizophrenia, with vital asthenia and vegetative symptoms. Cephaleas and head dysaesthesias are reported. There is no doubt that coenaesthetic schizophrenia has many points in common with latent schizophrenia; on the other hand it is also closely linked to hypochondriac depression, the syndrome of endogenous juvenile failure, certain latent depressions, hypochondriac euphoria, vegetative and endoreactive dysthmia and pseudoneurotic schizophrenia. Personal studies of stress responses in schizophrenia, and pneumoencephalographic examinations and EEG data in the active stage suggest diencephalic alteration. For diagnostic and initially therapeutic purposes, every patient with cephalea should be examined thoroughly by the psychiatrist; in this way the number of schizophrenias identified and treated will be considerably increased.","The dopamine hypothesis, which posits that dysregulation of the dopaminergic system is etiologic for schizophrenia, is among the most enduring biological theories in psychiatry. Although variation within genes related to dopaminergic functioning has been associated with schizophrenia, an aggregate test of variation, using the largest publicly available schizophrenia dataset, has not previously been conducted.","### Answer:
- Target word: Schizophrenia
- Text A: Text A discusses schizophrenia in the context of various psychiatric symptoms and conditions. The focus is on the manifestations of ""coenasthetic schizophrenia,"" which includes a range of sensations and psychiatric symptoms like hypochondriac depression and vegetative symptoms. Schizophrenia is described in a more phenomenological and syndrome-focused manner, linking it to a wide array of psychological and physical symptoms and suggesting a broad diagnostic approach.
- Text B: Text B focuses on the biological underpinnings of schizophrenia, specifically discussing the dopamine hypothesis. It represents a scientific approach to understanding the disease, focusing on genetic factors and neurochemical dysregulation as etiological factors in schizophrenia. This text represents a more modern, biological, and research-oriented view of schizophrenia, emphasizing genetics and the role of neurotransmitters.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The meaning and conceptualization of ""schizophrenia"" have undergone a significant shift. In Text A, the focus is on a broad, symptomatic perspective with a variety of associated psychiatric and somatic conditions, reflecting an older, more phenomenological understanding of the disorder. In contrast, Text B emphasizes a biomedical model, focusing on genetic and neurochemical research and understanding, indicative of a shift towards more scientifically measurable and specific factors underlying the condition. The semantic drift reflects a transition from a broad, syndrome-based view to a more specific, scientifically grounded biomedical model."
56,Schizophrenia,"The influence of a behavioural family treatment on parental communication deviance (CD) was investigated in a longitudinal treatment study. Subjects were the parents of young patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or related disorders. Parents and patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: individual out-patient treatment or a combination of individual out-patient and family treatment. Parental CD was assessed with the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) both at the start of the out-patient treatment and after completion of treatment 1 year later. Most families had high levels of CD, a finding which is in agreement with previous CD studies. These high CD levels remained stable over the 12-month period. Family treatment was not effective in influencing the level of CD. The findings suggest that high CD is a stable trait-marker of parents, and they support the notion that high levels of CD may precede the onset of serious psychotic disorders. Studies with more chronic patients are needed to replicate the findings.","Approximately five percent of the Finnish population are Swedish-speaking and have higher socioeconomic position and longer life expectancy than the Finnish-speaking majority. Previous studies have not investigated whether Swedish-speaking Finns have lower risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) than Finnish-speaking Finns. We investigated this in a representative sample of 47 445 Finns born in 1972-1984. Hazard ratios of SSD between language groups were assessed with conditional proportional hazards regression. Sex, parental ages at birth, paternal employment around conception, parental psychosis and place and residence in the capital area were used as other explanatory variables. The prevalence of SSD was 0.7% in the Swedish-speaking minority and 1.5% in the Finnish-speaking majority. In the adjusted regression model, belonging to the Swedish-speaking minority was associated with lower risk of SSD (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.69). In a subset analysis by gender, the protective effect was evident among Swedish-speaking males (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15-0.68) but marginal in females (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41-1.37). Parental psychosis and place of birth in the capital area were associated with higher risk of SSD, whereas paternal employment at the time of conception was associated with lower risk of SSD. Our results support the role of social factors in the etiology of schizophrenia. Belonging to a minority with high socioeconomic status and social capital may be protective against schizophrenia, especially for males. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used within the context of discussing its prevalence, risk factors, and associated conditions or factors influencing it. Text A focuses on the relation between parental communication deviance and the onset of schizophrenia as a psychosocial factor, while Text B explores epidemiological aspects, such as demographic and social factors influencing the prevalence of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In both cases, the word ""schizophrenia"" is used consistently to refer to a specific mental disorder characterized by various influencing factors, without showing a shift in its basic meaning or the context of serious psychological disorder. The use and relevance in medical or psychological research contexts remain aligned across the two texts, therefore indicating no significant semantic drift."
57,Schizophrenia,The present investigation demonstrates relatively high antibody titres against an E. coli O-antigen in sera from somatically healthy male schizophrenic patients. This observation supports the suggestion that abnormal portasystemic collaterals are relevant to the manifestation of schizophrenia.,"Our study aimed to assess the psychometric validity of the conceptual disorganization item and other items of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for detecting disorganized speech in patients with schizophrenia. We included 357 schizophrenia patients with disorganized speech and 1082 without disorganized speech from the survey centers in India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Taiwan, using the data from the Research on Asian Psychotropic Patterns for Antipsychotics (REAP-AP) study. After adjusting the effects of confounding variables, a binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify BPRS items independently associated with disorganized speech. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify optimum cut-off scores and their sensitivities and specificities for detecting disorganized speech. After adjusting the effects of confounding variables, the fitted binary logistic regression model indicated that conceptual disorganization (P < 0.0001), uncooperativeness (P = 0.010) and excitement (P = 0.001) were independently associated with disorganized speech. The ROC curve revealed that the conceptual disorganization item could accurately detect disorganized speech in patients with schizophrenia both separately and in combination with uncooperativeness and excitement. The subscale for conceptual disorganization, uncooperativeness and excitement items in the BPRS is a promising psychometric tool for detecting disorganized speech.","###Answer:
- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:** From Text A to Text B, the use of the word ""schizophrenia"" retains its medical and diagnostic context related to psychiatric disorders, consistently focusing on studies around the manifestation and characteristics of schizophrenia in patients. Text A discusses the possible biological markers (antibodies in this case) associated with schizophrenia, highlighting a unique investigatory angle within the medical context of the disease. Text B transitions into the evaluation of schizophrenia symptoms using psychometric tools, specifically analyzing disorganized speech. Despite the difference in the focus of research (biological markers vs. symptom evaluation), the fundamental understanding and usage of the term ""schizophrenia"" have not shifted and it remains dedicated to characterizing aspects of the psychiatric condition. Thus, the semantic content and context of ""schizophrenia"" as relating to a specific mental health condition remains consistent across both texts."
58,Schizophrenia,"Interventional strategies for the prodromal phase of schizophrenia are based largely on treatment concepts that have already been shown to be effective for the prevention of relapses. Such a multimodal concept for early psychotherapeutic intervention has been developed at the psychiatric department of the University of Cologne. This model emphasizes individual symptom-oriented cognitive/behavioral treatment and psychoeducation directed both to the patient and his/her contact person(s). In addition, stress and symptom management, training of social skills and computer-aided cognitive training tailored to individual needs are also offered. In contrast, pharmacological treatment is considered only when, despite the above-mentioned strategy, the clinical picture worsens appreciably and attenuated psychotic symptoms have appeared.","Certain cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been linked to dysfunction of prefrontal cortical (PFC) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons and appear neurodevelopmental in nature. Since opioids suppress GABA neuron activity, we conducted the first study to determine 1) whether the μ opioid receptor (MOR), δ opioid receptor (DOR), and opioid ligand proenkephalin are altered in the PFC of a large cohort of schizophrenia subjects and 2) the postnatal developmental trajectory in monkey PFC of opioid markers that are altered in schizophrenia. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure mRNA levels from 42 schizophrenia and 42 matched healthy comparison subjects; 18 monkeys chronically exposed to haloperidol, olanzapine, or placebo; and 49 monkeys aged 1 week-11.5 years. We found higher levels for MOR mRNA (+27%) in schizophrenia but no differences in DOR or proenkephalin mRNAs. Elevated MOR mRNA levels in schizophrenia did not appear to be explained by substance abuse, psychotropic medications, or illness chronicity. Finally, MOR mRNA levels declined through early postnatal development, stabilized shortly before adolescence and increased across adulthood in monkey PFC. In schizophrenia, higher MOR mRNA levels may contribute to suppressed PFC GABA neuron activity and might be attributable to alterations in the postnatal developmental trajectory of MOR signaling.","###Answer:

- **Label:** Unchanged

- **Reason:** In Text A, the discussion of schizophrenia centers around treatment strategies in its prodromal phase and the use of psychological interventions alongside limited pharmacology when symptoms escalate. This portrays a multifaceted approach to managing and understanding the disease, emphasizing symptom management and therapy. In Text B, the focus shifts to the biological underpinnings of schizophrenia, examining the role of neurotransmitters and receptors in the prefrontal cortex contributing to cognitive deficits. Despite this shift towards a more molecular and neurodevelopmental perspective, the fundamental understanding of schizophrenia as a complex, multifaceted disorder remains unchanged. Both texts highlight different aspects—clinical interventions and neurobiological research—without altering the basic comprehension of the disorder as involving significant cognitive and psychological symptoms that require a comprehensive treatment and understanding approach. Hence, the semantic drift in the term ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts is minimal or nonexistent, representing a consistent core definition framed by different scientific approaches and focuses over time."
59,Schizophrenia,"Iloperidone is a novel atypical antipsychotic compound currently under clinical development for the treatment of psychotic disorders. In radioligand binding studies, iloperidone binds with high affinity to serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A and noradrenaline alpha1 and alpha2C receptors [Neuropsychopharmacology (2001) 25, 904-914]. The human metabolism of iloperidone generates two major metabolites, P88-8991 and P95-12113. The aim of this study was to compare the receptor affinity profile of P88-8991 and P95-12113 with that of the parent compound. The receptor affinity profile of P88-8991 is comparable to that of iloperidone. This metabolite binds to the following monoamine receptors (pKi values in nM): serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (9.56), adrenergic alpha1 (8.08) and alpha2C (7.79) receptors, and D2A receptors (7.80). Lower affinity is seen for other dopamine, serotonin, alpha2-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. In contrast, P95-12113 shows affinity for 5-HT2A receptors (pKi 8.15; which is 60-fold lower than that of iloperidone), adrenergic alpha1 (7.67), alpha2C (7.32) and alpha2B (7.08) receptors. Given this affinity profile, and the observation that P95-12113 does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, it is unlikely that this metabolite contributes to the therapeutic effect of iloperidone in patients with schizophrenia. However, the comparable receptor binding profile of P88-8991 indicates that it is likely to contribute to the clinical profile of iloperidone.","Adequate prenatal nutrition is essential for optimal brain development. There is a growing body of evidence from epidemiology linking exposure to nutritional deprivation and increased risk of schizophrenia. Based on studies from the Netherlands and China, those exposed to macronutrient deficiencies during famine have an increased risk of schizophrenia. With respect to micronutrients, we focus on 3 candidates where there is biological plausibility for a role in this disorder and at least 1 study of an association with schizophrenia. These nutrients include vitamin D, folic acid, and iron. While the current evidence is incomplete, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for the prevention of schizophrenia. We argue that schizophrenia can draw inspiration from public health interventions related to prenatal nutrition and other outcomes and speculate on relevant factors that bear on the nature, risks, impact, and logistics of various nutritional strategies that may be employed to prevent this disorder.","- **Label**: Unchanged

Text A discusses a pharmacological approach, examining the effectiveness and profiles of specific drug metabolites in treating schizophrenia. Text B, on the other hand, explores the preventive aspect through prenatal nutrition and its impact on the risk of developing schizophrenia. In both cases, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used consistently as a reference to the disorder itself, without any shift in connotation or semantic drift. The contexts reflect different aspects of addressing the disorder - treatment in Text A and preventive factors in Text B - yet the core understanding of ""schizophrenia"" as a mental health condition remains stable across both texts."
60,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is hypothesized as a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder based on the following findings. 1. MRI studies have revealed brain structural abnormalities from the onset of schizophrenia and the progress of these structural abnormalities. 2. Histopathological studies have elucidated cytoarchitectural abnormalities in schizophrenic brains without gliosis. 3. Obstetric complications are one of the risk factors for schizophrenia. 4. Relapse of schizophrenia results in a deteriorating progress of the disorder. Furthermore, data from family, twin and adoption studies show evidence of a substantial genetic component in schizophrenia, Thus, a molecular genetic study combined with a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative hypothesis is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The positive association between neuregulin 1 and Icelandic schizophrenia that has been reproduced in Scottish and North European schizophrenia is one of the intriguing examples of this type of research. Neuregulin 1 regulates the cytoarchitecture of brain. Mice mutated for neuregulin 1 show a behavioral phenotype that overlaps with mouse models for schizophrenia. Furthermore, the behavioral phenotypes of the neuregulin 1 hypomorphs are reversible with clozapine. We also demonstrated a positive association between schizophrenia and a 5-HT5A receptor polymorphism, Pro15Ser, that may have role in cell differentiation in the brain.","The nosological status of catatonia in modern classificatory systems and the influence of culture on its presentation are not fully understood. A secondary analysis of the data collected for another study that looked at the incidence of catatonia in India and Wales was performed to examine the association of catatonia to ICD 10 F diagnostic categories in two different cultural settings. The most common clinical diagnosis assigned by clinicians in India was from ICD10 F 20, while in Wales it was from ICD10 F30. The differences between the two settings were found in the F20 group. Association of catatonia appears to be more consistent with affective disorders in the two settings, but not with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The findings are subjected to the limitations of secondary analysis.","### Label: Unchanged

In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains its essential reference to a clinical psychiatric disorder, though the contexts and applications vary slightly. 

- **Text A** discusses schizophrenia as part of a broader explorative discussion on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative aspects, emphasizing its structural and genetic underpinnings. The word is clearly tied to discussing the disorder's characteristics, progression, and some genetic associations that may contribute to its understanding and management.

- **Text B** uses ""schizophrenia"" primarily in analyzing data on the association of catatonia with different diagnostic categories. It also implies that in certain cultural settings, schizophrenia may not be commonly associated with catatonia as much as affective disorders are.

Despite the variation in the specific focus of discussion - with Text A leaning more on the pathological understanding and Text B examining clinical diagnosis in different cultural settings - the core meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a significant mental health disorder remains consistent. There is no evidence of semantic drift in the word ""schizophrenia"" from a clinical or diagnostic perspective between Text A and Text B."

Notably, it is now emerging that several genes that undergo perinatal changes in DNA methylation are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. In this context, we envisaged that epigenetic modifications during the perinatal period may potentially drive essential changes in the genes regulating brain levels of critical neuromodulators such as D-serine and D-aspartate. Dysfunction of this fine regulation may contribute to the genesis of schizophrenia or other mental disorders, in which altered levels of D-amino acids are found. We recently demonstrated that Ddo, the D-aspartate degradation gene, is actively demethylated to ultimately reduce D-aspartate levels. However, the role of epigenetics as a mechanism driving the regulation of appropriate D-ser levels during brain development has been poorly investigated to date.","- Label: Unchanged

64,Schizophrenia,"The prevalence of abnormal subjective experiences is high in schizophrenic patients. This study starts from the hypothesis that these subjective disorders are associated with cognitive disturbances. In order to test this hypothesis a study was carried out on 40 patients who were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia according to RDC and DSM-III-R criteria. They were consecutively admitted due to a recrudescence of their symptomatology. Version 3 of the Frankfurt Complaint Questionnaire, adapted for Spanish by the authors, was used as an instrument for the assessment of subjective experiences. Eight patients refused to answer the questionnaire. A neuropsychological battery, including the Mini-Mental State, some subtests from the WAIS, Bender's visual-motor test, Rey's Complex Figure, and the Trail Making Test, was used. Frontal neurological signs were evaluated. The abnormal subjective experiences of schizophrenics presented a close association with neuropsychological disturbances and, to a lesser degree, of intensity with frontal neurological signs. Regression analyses by means of stepwise method and partial correlation analyses were undertaken. Many significant relationships between subjective experiences and cognitive disturbances persisted after controlling the influence of age, gender, education, lack of insight, neuroleptic doses, and biperidene doses.","Clozapine is indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), but only 30%-60% of patients will respond.

Using 1997 American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Research Network (PRN) Study data on patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, we identified the characteristics of antipsychotic medications (APMs) currently being prescribed and factors associated with the use of particular regimens. In this study population, use of the newer APMs, including risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine, has increased rapidly and now accounts for over one-half of all APM use. Other intriguing findings include the fact that one-sixth of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are concurrently treated with two or more APMs. Factors associated with being prescribed one of the newer APMs risperidone or olanzapine include being elderly, having more education, being white, having psychiatric comorbidity, and making fewer recent visits to a psychiatrist. The APA PRN Study data are an important new resource for mental health services researchers.","The synapsins are a family of neuronal phosphoproteins evolutionarily conserved in invertebrate and vertebrate organisms. Their best-characterised function is to modulate neurotransmitter release at the pre-synaptic terminal, by reversibly tethering synaptic vesicles (SVs) to the actin cytoskeleton. However, many recent data have suggested novel functions for synapsins in other aspects of the pre-synaptic physiology, such as SV docking, fusion and recycling. Synapsin activity is tightly regulated by several protein kinases and phosphatases, which modulate the association of synapsins to SVs as well as their interaction with actin filaments and other synaptic proteins. In this context, synapsins act as a link between extracellular stimuli and the intracellular signalling events activated upon neuronal stimulation. Genetic manipulation of synapsins in various in vivo models has revealed that, although not essential for the basic development and functioning of neuronal networks, these proteins are extremely important in the fine-tuning of neuronal plasticity, as shown by the epileptic phenotype and behavioural abnormalities characterising mouse lines lacking one or more synapsin isoforms. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge about how the various members of the synapsin family are involved in the modulation of the pre-synaptic physiology. We give a comprehensive description of the molecular basis of synapsin function, as well as an overview of the more recent evidence linking mutations in the synapsin proteins to the onset of severe central nervous system diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" refers to a central nervous system disorder characterized by distinct psychiatric conditions. Text A discusses treatments and characteristics of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, focusing on the use of antipsychotic medications and factors influencing their use. Text B delves into genetic and physiological perspectives, examining the role of synapsin proteins in synaptic processes and their links to several neurological disorders including schizophrenia. Despite the different approaches and depths of discussion, the fundamental meaning and medical context of ""schizophrenia"" as a severe psychiatric disorder remain consistent between both texts, demonstrating that the core semantic meaning remains unchanged."
66,Schizophrenia,"The binding of [125I]p-iodoclonidine to alpha-2, and/or [125I]iodopindolol to beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors was measured in right prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 10) and right hippocampus from subjects with DSM-III-R diagnoses of major depression (n = 15) or schizophrenia (n = 8) as well as from control subjects (n = 20). No significant differences between study groups were observed in binding to alpha-2 adrenoceptors in any of the six layers of prefrontal cortex or in any of the hippocampal fields. Likewise, there were no significant differences in beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptor binding in any of the hippocampal fields between control and major depressive subjects. In contrast, binding to beta-1 adrenoceptors, but not beta-2 adrenoceptors, was significantly lower (-13 to -27%) in most hippocampal fields of schizophrenic subjects as compared to control subjects or to major depressives. Alterations in beta-1 adrenoceptor binding in the hippocampus of schizophrenics provide further evidence for a role of central noradrenergic neurons in the neurochemical pathology of schizophrenia.","Abnormalities in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons cause neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. Unlike other types of neurons that can be efficiently differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, PV neurons were minimally generated using a conventional differentiation strategy. In this study we developed an adenovirus-based transdifferentiation strategy that incorporates an additional chemical compound for the efficient generation of induced PV (iPV) neurons. The chemical compound forskolin combined with Ascl1 induced ∼80% of mouse fibroblasts to iPV neurons. The iPV neurons generated by this procedure matured 5-7 days post infection and were characterized by electrophysiological properties and known neuronal markers, such as PV and GABA. Our studies, therefore, identified an efficient approach for generating PV neurons.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used in a scientific or medical context, specifically related to neurochemical or neurodevelopmental research. Text A discusses schizophrenia in connection with neurochemical pathology through adrenoceptor binding in the hippocampus, indicating an exploration of biological mechanisms underlying the disorder. Similarly, Text B mentions schizophrenia in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders linked to abnormalities in certain types of interneurons. Thus, both texts employ ""schizophrenia"" to discuss aspects of its biological basis, showing no significant semantic drift in the usage of the term over time."
67,Schizophrenia,"The rat prefrontal cortices participate in cognitive, affective and mnemonic functions. The importance of dopamine innervation for these computations is illustrated in studies showing that both supranormal levels and chemical lesions of prefrontal dopamine induce severe behavioral deficits. Observed hormone effects on some of these same behaviors suggest that the prefrontal cortices are also sensitive to gonadal steroids. These two influences seem to converge in recent evidence of increased dopamine axon density in representative prefrontal but not sensory or motor cortices in gonadectomized adult male rats. The seeming selectivity of these effects was further explored here using immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-b-hydroxylase, serotonin and choline acetyltransferase to label neurochemically identified afferents in remaining, unstudied prefrontal fields of rat cortex in animals that were sham-operated or gonadectomized and given placebo, testosterone propionate, estradiol or dihydrotestosterone 28 days before being killed. Group comparisons revealed that across prefrontal zones, gonadectomy produced androgen-sensitive increases in presumed dopamine axon density, but did not affect the other afferents. These findings thus bolster evidence for a targeted gonadal steroid influence involving the prefrontal cortices and a neurotransmitter essential for their normal operations and implicated in their dysfunction in disorders such as schizophrenia as well.","Previous qualitative studies have found that exercise may facilitate symptomatic and functional recovery in people with long-term schizophrenia. This study examined the perceived effects of exercise as experienced by people in the early stages of psychosis, and explored which aspects of an exercise intervention facilitated or hindered their engagement.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains a similar meaning related to the psychological disorder characterized by abnormalities in perception or expression of reality. Text A delves into neurological and biochemical substrates of processes potentially implicated in schizophrenia, focusing mainly on the effects of neurotransmitters and gonadal steroids in the prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in schizophrenia. Text B discusses schizophrenia in a clinical therapy context, focusing on the effects of exercise on individuals in the early stages of the condition. Although the focus of each text varies—one looking at biochemical aspects and the other at rehabilitative therapy—the fundamental understanding and reference to ""schizophrenia"" as a mental health disorder remain consistent. There is no significant drift in the semantic representation of ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts. The word continues to refer to the same medical and psychiatric condition in both contexts, indicating that there is no semantic drift over time."
68,Schizophrenia,We compared thought-disturbance via the Rorschach-derived Ego Impairment Index (EII) between DSM-IV paranoid vs. nonparanoid (undifferentiated and disorganized) subtypes of older schizophrenia patients.,"The microglial hypothesis of schizophrenia suggests that its neuropathology is closely associated with neuroinflammation manifested, inter alia, by an increased expression of cytokines. However, clinical investigations imply that schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease and in some groups of patients the activated inflammatory process does not contribute to the disease-associated impairment of brain function. Clinical studies revealed also an equivocal impact of antipsychotics on peripheral and CSF cytokines, whereas experimental research performed on the stimulated glia cultures showed their inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the present study, the effect of chlorpromazine, haloperidol and risperidone (0.5, 5 or 10μM) on production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and anti-inflammatory IL-10 was investigated in the unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary rat mixed glial cell cultures. In the unstimulated cultures, haloperidol at all applied concentrations, risperidone at 5, 10μM and chlorpromazine at 10μM increased IL-10 levels in the culture supernatants without a significant influence on IL-1β or TNF-α levels, and all drugs applied at 10μM induced a robust increase in IL-10 mRNA expression. Under strong inflammatory activation, haloperidol and risperidone at all concentrations reduced production of both pro-inflammatory cytokines, without adverse effects on IL-10 expression when used at 10μM. Chlorpromazine at all concentrations diminished the production of three cytokines and did not induce anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that dependently on glia activation antipsychotics via different mechanisms may induce anti-inflammatory effect and that this activity is not common for all drugs under conditions of strong glia activation.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""schizophrenia"" is primarily mentioned in the context of psychological methods and clinical subtypes (paranoid vs. nonparanoid), focusing on cognitive or thought disturbances typical in the disorder. This view employs conventional clinical classification and symptoms interpretation. Meanwhile, Text B introduces ""schizophrenia"" in relation to a more recent medical hypothesis concerning neuroinflammation, with a biological basis emphasizing cytokine involvement and neuroimmune interactions. This reflects a shift from a largely psychological and symptomatic perception to a more biological and mechanistic understanding, indicating a significant semantic drift in the conceptualization and approach to the disease over time."
69,Schizophrenia,"This study was carried out to investigate the association of a polymorphism of the CTLA-4 gene, at position 49 of exon 1, with schizophrenia in the Korean population. Among Korean patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV, 116 patients who met the selection criteria were recruited for the study. One hundred and forty-nine normal healthy Koreans from the Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Information Bank, were used as a normal control group. DNA was extracted from whole blood using proteinase K and the CTLA-4 gene region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Geneo typing was performed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). The genotype and allele distribution in patients with schizophrenia was significantly different from that seen in the control group. This study suggests a putative role of the CTLA-4 gene polymorphism at position 49 of exon 1 for schizophrenia in the Korean population, although the detailed mechanisms remained to be elucidated.","Schizophrenia is associated with several brain deficits, as well as visual processing deficits, but clinically useful biomarkers are elusive. We hypothesized that retinal layer changes, noninvasively visualized using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), may represent a possible ""window"" to these abnormalities.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason:
  In both texts provided, the term ""schizophrenia"" refers to a serious mental disorder. Text A from an earlier period focuses on the genetic association and potential gene polymorphism linked to schizophrenia, highlighting a research approach towards understanding the genetic dimensions of the disorder. Text B, presumably from a later period, discusses schizophrenia in the context of identifying neurobiological or physical markers associated with the disorder, particularly through visual and retinal assessments using noninvasive technologies. Despite the advances in research methods and investigative tools shifting from genetic polymorphisms to neurobiological indicators, the conceptualization of ""schizophrenia"" as a mental health disorder remains consistent between the two texts. There is no significant drift in the central meaning or the way schizophrenia is perceived medically; the transition primarily lies in the methodologies and areas of exploration within the same disorder framework. Thus, the label reflects that the core meaning of ""schizophrenia"" remains unchanged across the texts."
70,Schizophrenia,"The advent of the newer ""atypical"" antipsychotics has revolutionized pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia (SZ) and other psychotic disorders. In contrast to the first-generation conventional neuroleptics, these second-generation antipsychotic agents possess a broader spectrum of efficacy and cause fewer motor side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. Despite their substantial advantages, however, these second-generation agents also have significant limitations in terms of both efficacy and adverse effects. Several strategies to address these shortcomings are currently under study and some of these are likely to become part of our therapeutic armamentarium in the future. Current shortcomings in the pharmacologic treatment of SZ and strategies under investigation to address each of these deficiencies are reviewed. New formulations of existing medications and new antipsychotics under development are discussed. Developing adjunctive treatment strategies to address each of the major psychopathologic domains in SZ are summarized. The potential application of genetic information to treatment-matching in SZ is reviewed and likely refinements in the practice of evidence-based medicine in the pharmacotherapy of SZ are considered.","Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms (emotional flatness, apathy, and lack of speech). It causes social and economic burdens to patients and their family. Although etiology of schizophrenia is still uncertain, dopamine dysregulation is traditionally considered as a main etiological factor of schizophrenia, which has been utilized to develop drugs for treating schizophrenia. Recently, inflammation has presented being a risk factor for schizophrenia in that neuroinflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the exacerbation of symptom severity. Various factors including diet can regulate inflammatory state. Specific foods or dietary patterns have anti- or pro-inflammatory potentials. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation have been reported in schizophrenia populations and were related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Omega-3 fatty acids were often recommended to schizophrenia patients because of their anti-inflammatory activities. In this review, we investigate the inflammation-related pathogenesis of schizophrenia and summarize potential nutritional approaches to inhibit the manifestation of symptoms and to alleviate symptom severity using anti-inflammatory nutrients or functional components.","###Answer:
- Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
The use of the word ""schizophrenia"" in both Text A and Text B refers consistently to the mental illness characterized by specific psychiatric symptoms. Text A highlights advancements in pharmacologic treatments for schizophrenia, emphasizing the various attributes and advancements in antipsychotic medications. Text B, while discussing more about potential etiological factors like inflammation and dietary influences, still primarily focuses on schizophrenia as a mental disorder with specific symptoms and treatments.

Despite different aspects being discussed in each text—Text A leaning towards pharmacological treatment and Text B towards etiological factors and nutritional approaches—the core definition and understanding of schizophrenia as a disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and other symptoms remain consistent across both texts. The semantic integrity and basic understanding of the term ""schizophrenia"" as a mental illness have not altered, hence the label ""Unchanged""."
71,Schizophrenia,"Neuropsychiatric disorders are generally diagnosed based on a classification of behavioral and, in some cases, specific neurological deficits. The lack of distinct quantitative and qualitative biological descriptors at the anatomical and cellular level complicates the search for and understanding of the neurobiology of these disorders. The advent of microarray technology has enabled large-scale profiling of transcriptional activity, allowing a comprehensive characterization of transcriptional patterns relating to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. We review some of the unique methodological constraints related to the use of human postmortem brain tissue in addition to the generally applicable requirements for microarray experiments. Microarray studies undertaken in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and substance abuse by the use of postmortem brain tissue indicate that transcriptional changes relating to synaptic function and plasticity, cytoskeletal function, energy metabolism, oligodendrocytes, and distinct intracellular signaling pathways are generally present. These have been supported by microarray studies in experimental models, and have produced multiple avenues to be explored at the functional level. The quality and specificity of information obtained from human postmortem tissue is rapidly increasing with the maturation and refinement of array-related methodologies and analysis tools, and with the use of focused cell populations. The development of experimental models of gene regulation in these disorders will serve as the initial step towards a comprehensive genome-linked analysis of the brain and associated disorders, and help characterize the integration and coordinate regulation of complex functions within the CNS.","Patients with schizophrenia reveal impaired decision-making strategies causing social, financial and health care problems.

Little is known about coping strategies used by families of individuals with incipient or emergent psychosis.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used to refer to a severe mental health disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand reality. Text A discusses the treatment of patients with schizophrenia by general practitioners, examining the scope of care provided to such patients in a medical setting. Text B discusses coping mechanisms adopted by families of patients with schizophrenia, addressing the social and psychological impacts of the disorder on family members and their methods of dealing with it.

74,Schizophrenia,"This work is devoted to the study of CPK BB content in nuclear fraction of nervous cells in normal brain and in brains of mental (schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease) patients. With the help of the immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting was detected, that the nuclear membrane fraction of brain contains significant amount of CPK BB. On the contrary, in the nuclear membrane fractions of schizophrenic and Alzheimer disease brains the content of this isoenzyme decreased. Therefore in the brain of schizophrenic and Alzheimer disease patients the content of CPK BB decreased not only in cytosolic fractions, but also in the fractions of nuclear membranes. We demonstrated also, that cytosolic CPK BB associates not only with nuclear membranes, but with synaptosomal and microsomal fractions and mitochondrias of normal brain cells.","Abnormal resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations are reported in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder, illnesses with overlapping symptoms and genetic risk.

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used in a medical or scientific context to describe a class of mental disorder characterized and studied through specific biological markers and anomalies. Text A discusses the decreased levels of CPK BB in the brains of patients with schizophrenia in comparison to non-diseased brains, indicating a pathological or structural difference associated with the disease. Text B examines abnormal EEG oscillations in schizophrenia, linking the condition with similar brain function abnormalities.

75,Schizophrenia,"As many as 56 patients suffering from slow-progredient attack-like schizophrenia running its course with the predominance of obsessions in the clinical picture were examined and followed up for 3 to 5 years. At the moment of the examination the patients' age ranged from 8 to 15 years. It has been established that during slow-progredient attack-like schizophrenia in children and adolescents, obsessions occur in the structure of ""large"" obsessive syndromes characterized by polymorphism of psychopathological disorders and always including remarkable affective symptomatology. Six types of obsessive conditions were distinguished, each of which was marked by a definite stereotype of the disease natural history and correlated with the degree of the process progress. Among the types of obsessive conditions described, depressive ones with obsessions (three types) led on the whole to less pronounced alterations of the personality than obsessive-anxious ones, particularly anxious-hypochondriac attacks after the completion of which there formed relatively more profound personality changes.","The susceptibility genes for schizophrenia Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and ErbB4 have critical functions during brain development and in the adult. Alterations in the ErbB4 signaling pathway cause a variety of neurodevelopmental defects including deficiencies in neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and myelination. I have used the ErbB4(-/-) HER4(heart) KO mice to study the neurodevelopmental insults associated to deficiencies in the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway and their potential implication with brain disorders such as schizophrenia, a chronic psychiatric disease affecting 1% of the population worldwide. ErbB4 deletion results in an array of neurodevelopmental deficits that are consistent with a schizophrenic model. First, similar defects appear in multiple brain structures, from the cortex to the cerebellum. Second, these defects affect multiple aspects of brain development, from deficits in neuronal migration to impairments in excitatory/inhibitory systems, including reductions in brain volume, cortical and cerebellar heterotopias, alterations in number and distribution of specific subpopulations of interneurons, deficiencies in the astrocytic and oligodendrocytic lineages, and additional insults in major brain structures. This suggests that alterations in specific neurodevelopmental genes that play similar functions in multiple neuroanatomical structures might account for some of the symptomatology observed in schizophrenic patients, such as defects in cognition. ErbB4 mutation uncovers flaws in brain development that are compatible with a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, and it establishes a comprehensive model to study the basis of the disorder before symptoms are detected in the adult. ","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""schizophrenia"" is used primarily in the context of describing a specific subtype characterized by attack-like patterns and associated predominantly with obsessive conditions in children and adolescents. The focus is on the clinical symptoms and types of manifestations within these patients. In Text B, the usage of ""schizophrenia"" shifts significantly towards a genetic and neurodevelopmental perspective, examining the role of specific genes like Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and ErbB4 and their impact on brain development. The discussion centers around how genetic alterations can lead to conditions that are observable in schizophrenia, implying a broader, more integrated model of the disorder that incorporates genetic, neurodevelopmental, and systemic insights. This shows a move from a purely symptomatic and clinical observation-based understanding to a complex bio-genetic and developmental model, indicating a semantic drift in how ""schizophrenia"" is approached and understood over time."
76,Schizophrenia,"The sinus rhythm resting heart rates of 138 schizophrenic patients were monitored electrocardiographically each for 30 min and were compared with those of 139 healthy controls. It was found that a significant sinus tachycardia existed in the patients. Factors of chronologic age, sex and treatment by psychotropic drugs were non-significant. A subsample of 22 process schizophrenic patients was compared with 20 healthy controls, matched for age, monitored continuously for a minimum of 120 min and analyzed by autocorrelation on a minute-by-minute basis for cardiac rate variation. Ultradian rhythms of each group revealed that the periodicity of cardiac rate variation in schizophrenia was significantly longer than that in health. Treatment by psychotropic drugs in half of the patient sample did not appear to influence the cardiac rate variation. It is suggested that the bradycardia existing between pulses of tachycardia in schizophrenia may be responsible not only for the dysplastic perception of these patients, but also for their premature death from vascular causes.","In the 1980s about 8.5% of patients in northern Netherlands with a psychotic disorder died due to suicide within five years of follow-up. Liemburg, Castelein and colleagues investigated whether this percentage had recently decreased. They found suicide in 2.4% of patients with recent psychosis after an average follow-up of 5 years. Although causality cannot be inferred from a naturalistic study such as theirs, it is plausible that the decreased suicide rate is associated with improvements in the care for psychotic patients. Preventing suicide is invaluable. However, given the alarmingly high mortality due to somatic diseases in patients with schizophrenia, other measures to substantially decrease the high mortality associated with schizophrenia are also warranted.

Therefore, the meaning of ""schizophrenia"" shows no significant semantic drift between the two texts."
78,Schizophrenia,"A total of 230 psychiatric inpatients and their physicians in charge took part in semistandardized interviews. Patients suffering from schizophrenia received information less frequently and less comprehensively than other patients. The label of schizophrenia was often paraphrased or not communicated at all; patients knew their diagnosis less exactly than other subgroups. Asked to indicate the most important cause of their disorder, neurotics tended to name their living conditions (60%), and addicts preferred to blame themselves (73%). Only 26% of the patients with affective disorders or schizophrenia accepted the idea of their disorders as diseases in a medical sense, whereas the psychiatrists favored a biological concept in more than 90% of the cases. The findings stress the need to improve communication between patients and psychiatrists as regards information on illness and treatment.","Previous studies suggest that elevated blood homocysteine levels and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism are risk factors for schizophrenia. However, the effects of gender and MTHFR C677T genotypes on blood homocysteine levels in schizophrenia have not been consistent. We first investigated whether plasma total homocysteine levels were higher in patients with schizophrenia than in controls with stratification by gender and by the MTHFR C677T genotypes in a large cohort (N = 1379). Second, we conducted a meta-analysis of association studies between blood homocysteine levels and schizophrenia separately by gender (N = 4714). Third, we performed a case-control association study between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and schizophrenia (N = 4998) and conducted a meta-analysis of genetic association studies based on Japanese subjects (N = 10 378). Finally, we assessed the effect of plasma total homocysteine levels on schizophrenia by a mendelian randomization approach. The ANCOVA after adjustment for age demonstrated a significant effect of diagnosis on the plasma total homocysteine levels in all strata, and the subsequent meta-analysis for gender demonstrated elevated blood homocysteine levels in both male and female patients with schizophrenia although antipsychotic medication might influence the outcome. The meta-analysis of the Japanese genetic association studies demonstrated a significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and schizophrenia. The mendelian randomization analysis in the Japanese populations yielded an OR of 1.15 for schizophrenia per 1-SD increase in plasma total homocysteine. Our study suggests that increased plasma total homocysteine levels may be associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used within the context of clinical and psychiatric study, focusing on patients identified with this mental disorder. Text A discusses the social and communication impacts involving perceptions and treatments related to schizophrenia, emphasizing a biological and medical perspective in understanding the disorder. On the other hand, Text B delves into the biological markers and genetic factors (like homocysteine levels and MTHFR C677T polymorphism) that might be associated with the risk and management of schizophrenia. Although the focus of the studies differ — one being more sociopsychological and the other more genetic and biomarker-based — both texts use the term ""schizophrenia"" consistently to refer to the same mental health diagnosis without a shift in the basic meaning or perception of the disorder itself. Hence, there is no significant semantic drift regarding the term “schizophrenia” between the two texts."
79,Schizophrenia,"For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia. Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81% had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia. After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R. The outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77% of cases by the presence or absence of self-experienced disturbances of perception, thought, speech or action.","Alterations in the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit might underlie the diversity of symptoms in schizophrenia. However, molecular changes in cerebellar neuronal circuits, part of this network, have not yet been fully determined. Using LC-MS/MS, we screened altered candidates in pooled grey matter of cerebellum from schizophrenia subjects who committed suicide (n = 4) and healthy individuals (n = 4). Further validation by immunoblotting of three selected candidates was performed in two cohorts comprising schizophrenia (n = 20), non-schizophrenia suicide (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 21). We found 99 significantly altered proteins, 31 of them previously reported in other brain areas by proteomic studies. Transport function was the most enriched category, while cell communication was the most prevalent function. For validation, we selected the vacuolar proton pump subunit 1 (VPP1), from transport, and two EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, calmodulin and parvalbumin, from cell communication. All candidates showed significant changes in schizophrenia (n = 7) compared to controls (n = 7). VPP1 was altered in the non-schizophrenia suicide group and increased levels of parvalbumin were linked to antipsychotics. Further validation in an independent cohort of non-suicidal chronic schizophrenia subjects (n = 13) and non-psychiatric controls (n = 14) showed that parvalbumin was increased, while calmodulin was decreased in schizophrenia. Our findings provide evidence of calcium-binding protein dysregulation in the cerebellum in schizophrenia, suggesting an impact on normal calcium-dependent synaptic functioning of cerebellar circuits. Our study also links VPP1 to suicide behaviours, suggesting a possible impairment in vesicle neurotransmitter refilling and release in these phenotypes.","- Label: Unchanged

Text A focuses on predictive studies of the development of schizophrenia based on early neuropsychological symptoms, and Text B discusses the molecular alterations in brain circuits related to schizophrenia. Although the context and depth of understanding have evolved in Text B with mentions of specific molecular and protein changes, the core concept and meaning of the word ""schizophrenia"" as a neuropsychiatric disorder remain unchanged.

80,Schizophrenia,"Multiple lines of evidence from pharmacological, neuroimaging, and postmortem studies implicate disturbances in cortical glutamate neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Given that pyramidal neurons are the principal source of cortical glutamate neurotransmission, as well as the targets of the majority of cortical glutamate-containing axon terminals, understanding the nature of altered glutamate neurotransmission in schizophrenia requires an appreciation of both the types of pyramidal cell abnormalities and the specific class(es) of pyramidal cells that are affected in the illness. In this chapter, we review evidence indicating that a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex exhibits reductions in dendritic spine density, a marker of the number of excitatory inputs, and in somal volume, a measure correlated with a neuron's dendritic and axonal architecture. Specifically, pyramidal neurons located in deep layer 3 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that lack immunoreactivity for nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein may be particularly involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The presence of similar changes in pyramidal neurons located in deep layer 3 of auditory association cortex suggests that a shared property, which remains to be determined, confers cell type-specific vulnerability to a subpopulation of cortical glutamatergic neurons in schizophrenia.","Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies indicate among schizophrenia patients (SZ) abnormal, often reduced, entrained steady-state (aSSR) and transient (N100/M100) neural responses to auditory stimuli. We complement this literature by focusing analyses on auditory cortices, assessing a wide range of stimulation frequencies with long driving periods and evaluating relationships between aSSR and M100 reductions in SZ.","###Answer:
- **Target word**: Schizophrenia
- **Text A**: Discusses the biological and structural changes in the brain concerning individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, focusing on neurotransmission, specifically the role of cortical glutamate and the abnormalities in the dendritic spine density and somal volume of pyramidal neurons. The text illuminates the scientific and neurobiological understanding of schizophrenia's pathophysiology.
- **Text B**: Focuses on experimental or empirical studies using EEG and MEG to analyze brain activity in response to auditory stimuli in schizophrenia patients, discussing the observed abnormalities in neural responses which correlate with common symptoms of the disorder.
- **Label**: Unchanged
- **Reason**: Both texts, despite differing in specific focus—one on microscopic cellular abnormalities and the other on macroscopic neural response patterns—share a consistent underlying conceptual thread: exploring the deviation from typical neurological function within schizophrenia. There is no significant semantic drift observed as both are entrenched in the biological and neurological discourse regarding schizophrenia as a mental health disorder, without diverging into any fundamentally disparate meanings. The term ""schizophrenia"" remains consistently used within the context of psychiatric and neurological research across both time periods."
81,Schizophrenia,"Abnormalities in amygdala and hippocampus have been shown to coexist in schizophrenia (SZ). In the hippocampus, compelling evidence suggests that a disruption of GABA neurotransmission is present mainly in sectors CA4, CA3, and CA2. The amygdala sends important inputs to the hippocampus and is also believed to have a defective GABA system in schizophrenia. To explore the possibility that changes in the hippocampal GABAergic system could be related to an increased inflow of activity originating in the amygdala, a ""partial"" animal model has been developed. In awake, freely moving, rats a GABA(A) receptor antagonist was infused locally into the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BLn). Within 2 hours, a decreased density of both the 65- and 67-kDa isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD(65) and GAD(67)) -immunoreactive (IR) terminals was detected on neuron somata in sectors CA3 and CA2, but not in CA1, CA3, or dentate gyrus. An increase of GAD(67)-IR somata was also found in the dentate gyrus and CA4. In anterograde tracer studies, amygdalo-hippocampal projection fibers were exclusively found in CA3 and CA2, but not CA1. Taken together, these results indicate that activation of amygdalo-hippocampal afferents is associated with the induction of significant changes in the GABA system of the hippocampus, with a subregional distribution that is remarkably similar to that found in SZ. Under pathologic conditions, an excessive discharge of excitatory activity emanating from the amygdala could be capable of altering inhibitory modulation along the trisynaptic pathway. This mechanism may potentially contribute to disturbances of GABAergic function in the major psychoses. Such ""partial"" rodent modelling provides an important strategy for deciphering the effect of altered cortico-limbic circuits in SZ.","The ZNF804A variant rs1344706 has consistently been associated with schizophrenia and plays a role in hippocampal-prefrontal functional connectivity during working memory. Whether the effect exists in the resting state and in patients with schizophrenia remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the ZNF804A polymorphism at rs1344706 in 92 schizophrenic patients and 99 healthy controls of Han Chinese descent, and used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the functional connectivity in the participants. We found a significant main effect of genotype on the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the hippocampus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in both schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The homozygous ZNF804A rs1344706 genotype (AA) conferred a high risk of schizophrenia, and also exhibited significantly decreased resting functional coupling between the left hippocampus and right DLPFC (F(2,165) = 13.43, P < 0.001). The RSFC strength was also correlated with cognitive performance and the severity of psychosis in schizophrenia. The current findings identified the neural impact of the ZNF804A rs1344706 on hippocampal-prefrontal RSFC associated with schizophrenia.","### Answer:

- Reason: 
  In both Text A and Text B, the term ""schizophrenia"" continues to be used in a medical and neurobiological context, referring specifically to abnormalities or alterations in brain function and structure associated with the condition. Text A discusses the role of the GABA neurotransmission in schizophrenia, its effects on the hippocampal regions, and presents data from a rodent model focusing on these aspects. Text B explores the genetic aspects of schizophrenia by discussing the influence of the ZNF804A gene variant on hippocampal-prefrontal functional connectivity, as well as its correlation with cognitive performance and psychosis severity in human subjects. Despite the difference in focus between genetic factors and neurotransmission effects, the underlying usage of ""schizophrenia"" remains consistent as a complex brain disorder examined primarily from a scientific, neurological, and genetic perspective. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a specific psychiatric condition remains unchanged between these two texts."
82,Schizophrenia,"It is argued that further research to achieve more detailed diagnostic systems in many psychiatric disorders is unlikely to be productive without taking genetic effects into account. Even when this is done, for example when carrying out segregation analysis to determine a mode of genetic transmission, mental illnesses often pose specific problems that preclude accurate analysis. Because techniques in molecular biology and genetics have made it possible to study gene effects in human disease systematically it should now be possible to specify the genes that are involved. When this has been achieved then a diagnostic system based on genetic causation can develop. This will have the advantage of helping to pinpoint environmental factors more accurately. Specific strategies will need to be adopted to overcome uncertain modes of inheritance, incomplete or non-penetrance of disease alleles and disease heterogeneity. Highly speculative hypotheses can be put forward for a locus causing Alzheimer's disease on a portion of the long arm of chromosome 21. For autism it is plausible that there is a disease locus at or near the fragile X site on the X chromosome. A locus for manic depression has been very tentatively mapped using DNA markers to chromosome 11 and in a small proportion of families DNA markers have also shown some evidence for X linkage. Schizophrenia does not seem to be associated with any favoured loci. Candidate genes for schizophrenia include those encoding dopamine, other neurotransmitter receptors or enzymes and various neuropeptides such as enkephalin and beta endorphin.","The extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway has been implicated in processes such as neuronal plasticity and resilience in psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia. The extent of the possible involvement of this pathway in psychiatric disorders remains unknown, as does its potential utility as a pharmacological target for the future development of novel therapeutics.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" is used within the context of discussing research relating to psychiatric disorders and their underlying biological or genetic factors. Text A focuses explicitly on genetic factors and potential candidate genes implicated in schizophrenia, highlighting the complexity and challenges associated with pinpointing specific genetic causes. Text B mentions schizophrenia as part of a discussion on the involvement of the ERK pathway in various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. The discussions in both texts are centered on exploring the biological underpinnings and potential targets for therapeutic intervention within the realm of psychiatric disorders. Thus, from Text A to Text B, the usage and conceptualization of ""schizophrenia"" as a psychiatric disorder with biological bases remain consistent, indicating no significant shift in meaning or connotation over the time period."
83,Schizophrenia,"Although neuroleptic medication is clearly effective, there is still an important role for psychological interventions for people with psychosis. Figures vary, but it can be estimated that between one quarter and one half of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience persistent symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, which cause distress and interference with functioning, despite taking medication (Fowler et al. 1995). Relapse occurs commonly even amongst patients who do adhere to medication regimes, and many people are reluctant to take long-term medication, because of its unpleasant and even disabling side-effects. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing cognitive behavioural therapy for those people with psychosis who continue to experience psychotic symptoms despite ongoing treatment with anti-psychotic medication. Cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis seeks to address directly those patterns of behaviour, thinking and emotional response which underpin and maintain severe and chronic delusions and hallucinations.","Dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP) is an unstable clinical condition observed in individuals with schizophrenia who have been treated with an antipsychotic medication at a high dosage and/or for a long period. An up-regulation of dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) is thought to be involved in the essential pathology of DSP. An antipsychotic agent with both tight binding to DRD2 and a long half-life is generally effective for treating DSP, but a patient who meets the criteria of treatment-resistant schizophrenia sometimes needs treatment with clozapine. We report the case details of two patients whose DSP was not controlled with several antipsychotics but was successfully controlled with asenapine. Asenapine binds to a broad range of dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, and it is thus distinct from other atypical antipsychotics. The unique profile of asenapine may contribute to the control of severe DSP symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason:
Both Text A and Text B discuss schizophrenia within a medical and clinical context, reflecting its continued conceptualization as a mental disorder characterized by symptoms like delusions and hallucinations. While Text A focuses on the broader psychological interventions and the persistence of symptoms in people with schizophrenia despite medication, Text B delves into a specific type of psychosis (Dopamine supersensitivity psychosis) that can occur in schizophrenia patients and how it's managed with different medications. The underlying concept of schizophrenia as involving severe and persistent mental health issues remains consistent across both texts.

The primary difference lies in the therapeutic approaches and deeper scientific understanding present in Text B, including specifics on dopamine receptor activity and medication mechanisms. However, the essence of what schizophrenia represents as a mental health condition remains unchanged, emphasizing its consistent perception as a severe psychiatric disorder requiring ongoing management. This indicates continuity rather than semantic drift in the medical understanding and usage of the term ""schizophrenia"" between the periods represented by the two texts."
84,Schizophrenia,"The generalized Carnot principle introduced by Brillouin provides a link between negentropy and information, but does not take into account the information stored in the brain, which is clearly excluded by the author. Further step in the generalization of Carnot's principle, which includes information turnover in the brain was accomplished by Kepiński in his theory of the metabolism of energy and information. According to Schrödinger, life processes require a supply of negentropy rather than energy stored in the food, more precisely, e.g., in glucose utilized by the brain, since energy is conserved, whereas negentropy is dissipated. The information (communication) channel transmits maximum information when the band width of the transmitted frequency is limited, and much less information when the restriction concerns the transmitted power, or energy. This can explain a considerable decrease in the information metabolism observed in depressive patients, whose life dynamics and, consequently, the amount of energy available for information metabolism is severly lowered. Thus, the fall in information metabolism is more pronounced in depression than in not too late phases of schizophrenia. As appears from Fonberg's studies the amygdaloid nucleus is responsible for the life dynamics. In different types of neuron code change is a significant parameter, which was so strongly stressed by Kepiński. Other problems discussed in the paper include: selection of information and its structural localization, localization of particular phases of information metabolism and their phylogenetic significance.","Visuospatial working memory (vsWM), which is impaired in schizophrenia, requires information transfer across multiple nodes in the cerebral cortex, including visual, posterior parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Information is conveyed across these regions via the excitatory projections of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons located in layer 3, whose activity is modulated by local inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons. Key properties of these neurons differ across these cortical regions. Consequently, in schizophrenia, alterations in the expression of gene products regulating these properties could disrupt vsWM function in different ways, depending on the region(s) affected.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, ""schizophrenia"" retains a consistent core meaning pertaining to a medical or psychological condition affecting brain function and information processing. In Text A, schizophrenia is discussed in terms of information metabolism in the brain, linking it to energetic and cognitive aspects of the condition. In Text B, the focus is specifically on the visuospatial working memory deficits characteristic of schizophrenia and involves detailed explanations about neuronal interactions and gene expression disruptions within the cerebral cortex in patients suffering from this condition. Although the detail and focus of the discussions differ, the underlying association of ""schizophrenia"" with a complex brain-based disorder remains consistent. Therefore, there is no significant semantic drift in the meaning of ""schizophrenia"" between the two texts."
85,Schizophrenia,"Pulver et al. [1994a] reported modest linkage evidence for a dominantly (D) inherited ""schizophrenia gene"" in the vicinity of IL2RB on chromosome 22q12, and Coon et al. [1994] adduced moderate evidence under a recessive (R) model. We report here a replication study to test the hypothesis that one of these two models (or a third, intermediate (I) model) adequately describes the co-segregation of schizophrenia and chromosome 22q12 markers in an independent sample of 23 multiplex families. Altogether nine transmission models were evaluated. The models differed depending on whether the 15 family members with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders were considered unaffected (a ""narrow"" (N) definition), affected (a ""wide"" (W) definition), or declared ""unknown"" (U). The entire region between D22S268 and D22S307 is excluded (i.e., lod <-2) for models RN, RW, RU, and IW. Lod scores for the remaining models are uniformly negative; albeit, equivocal with respect to the dominant hypothesis over a small region between D22S268 and IL2RB. Nonparametric analysis under both diagnostic criteria also failed to yield any evidence for a susceptibility locus in this region of chromosome 22.","Although psychiatric stigma in China is particularly pervasive and damaging, rates of high expressed emotion (""EE"" or family members' emotional attitudes that predict relapse) are generally lower than rates found in Western countries. In light of this seemingly incongruous juxtaposition and because Chinese comprise approximately one-fifth of the world's mentally ill, we examine how one of the most widely held causal beliefs of schizophrenia--excessive thinking (xiang tai duo)--may powerfully shape how those exhibiting psychotic symptoms pass from ""normal"" status to stigmatized ""other."" Using a framework by which stigma threatens an actor's capacity to participate in core everyday engagements, we examine how expressions of excessive thinking intersect with psychotic symptoms and how this idiom reduces stigma by preserving essential moral standing. Four focus groups with family members (n = 34 total) of schizophrenia outpatients, who had participated in psychoeducation, were conducted in Beijing. Open coding was conducted by 2 bilingual coders achieving high interrater agreement. Common expressions of excessive thinking--taking things too hard that is perceived as a causal factor and unwarranted suspicion that is used to benignly interpret paranoid symptoms encapsulated disruptive behaviors that closely overlapped with psychotic symptoms. Because excessive thinking is understood to occur universally, this idiom encourages socially accommodating behavior that signifies acceptance of these individuals as full-status community members. In contrast, due to beliefs implying moral contamination, those labeled mentally ill are threatened with both subtle and outright social exclusion. We discuss implications of this idiom for EE and the detection of schizophrenia ""prodrome"" in China.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
  Text A discusses schizophrenia in the context of genetic research, focusing on investigating the linkage between schizophrenia and specific genetic markers on chromosome 22q12. It uses clinical and scientific language and views schizophrenia primarily as a genetic disorder, taking into account different genetic models and their implications for understanding the disease's heritability and expression within families.

  Text B, however, presents a cultural and social perspective by focusing on the stigma associated with schizophrenia in China. It explores the social connotations of the term ""excessive thinking"" as it relates to schizophrenia, discussing how cultural beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia interact with symptoms and societal reactions. This text goes beyond the biomedical model, addressing the societal impacts, stigma, and traditional beliefs affecting how schizophrenia is perceived and managed.

  Thus, the semantic drift in the usage of ""schizophrenia"" from genetic and biological frameworks (Text A) toward examining the socio-cultural implications and how these affect treatment and perception of the condition (Text B) indicates a significant change in how the term is conceptualized and discussed over different contexts and periods."
86,Schizophrenia,"Dopamine receptors have been divided into two major types--D1 and D2--based primarily on pharmacological and biochemical criteria. Recent advances in the molecular biology of the dopamine receptor system have allowed the identification and characterisation of at least five distinct neuronal dopamine receptor genes (D1 to D5). These genes encode dopamine receptors belonging to the D1 receptor family, termed D1 and D5, and three D2-like receptors, termed D2, D3 and D4. These receptors are distinguished on the basis of their primary structure, chromosomal location, mRNA size and tissue distribution, and biochemical and pharmacological differences. Although individually these receptor subtypes may not be directly and exclusively involved in the maintenance or expression of schizophrenia, alterations of any of the receptors may contribute to the perturbation or instability of dopaminergic homeostasis in the brain. What was once thought to be a simple two-receptor system seems to have emerged as an intricate and interactive entity. This review summarises what is currently understood about dopamine receptors, their role in antipsychotic drug action, and their association with psychosis.","The psychiatric care of patients with schizophrenia has changed dramatically following the ""deinstitutionalization"" of mental health care in many Western countries. In a study of forensic autopsies in the Swedish city of Malmö between 1952 and 2005, we found an increase over time in the number of patients with schizophrenia whose bodies were not discovered until late after death, which correlated closely with the decrease in the number of hospital beds in the psychiatric services used by this group of patients. This indicates a strong increase in the social isolation and unavailability of adequate mental health care for patients with schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" maintains its overarching medical and clinical context pertaining to mental health. Text A focuses on the molecular and pharmacological aspects of schizophrenia, particularly explaining the role of dopamine receptors in the condition. Text B, on the other hand, discusses the societal and care aspects of schizophrenia, emphasizing changes in psychiatric care and the sociological impacts on patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite the different perspectives (biological versus societal), the fundamental usage and the association of the word ""schizophrenia"" with a specific mental health disorder remains consistent across both texts. Hence, the semantic meaning of ""schizophrenia"" as a psychiatric diagnosis has not drifted between the periods covered by Text A and Text B."
87,Schizophrenia,"Abnormal neurodevelopment and poor premorbid function have been described in schizophrenia. It is unclear whether abnormalities in these domains are increased in patients with early onset schizophrenia (EOS; onset before the 18th birthday) and whether they act to precipitate the earlier onset of the disorder. To address these questions, we collected information based on maternal interviews about the premorbid function of 40 adolescents with recent onset schizophrenia and an equal number of healthy controls using the Developmental Scale Score, the Premorbid Schizoid and Schizotypal Trait Scale (PSST) and Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS). Data on the PSST and PAS were also available in 54 patients with adult onset schizophrenia (AOS; onset after the 20th birthday). Compared to healthy controls, EOS patients had (a). delayed speech milestones, difficulties in reading and spelling and greater overall developmental deviance; (b). poor premorbid adjustment in childhood, which became even more deviant in adolescence particularly in boys and (c). more schizophrenia spectrum traits. Both premorbid adjustment and personality traits were more abnormal in patients with increased developmental deviance suggesting the possibility that they represent different manifestations of ongoing abnormalities in developmental processes. EOS patients had more impaired premorbid adjustment in adolescence and schizophrenia spectrum traits compared to AOS cases. Age of onset was related to developmental deviance, premorbid schizophrenia spectrum traits and childhood adjustment in EOS patients only.","Electroconvulsive therapy is an established treatment for symptoms of psychosis and is currently recommended for use in patients who are experiencing an acute exacerbation of positive symptoms or who have had catatonia. There is also evidence to suggest that electroconvulsive therapy can be a safe, effective treatment in first episode psychosis, such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders, particularly in treatment-resistant patients. Other forms of neuromodulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation) have less of an evidence base to support their use and are not formally indicated for the treatment of psychosis.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains its clinical and medical connotation related to a psychological and psychiatric disorder, characterized by a variety of symptoms affecting cognitive and emotional processes. Text A discusses aspects related to neurodevelopmental deviations and premorbid traits in early onset schizophrenia, emphasizing developmental issues and differences in onset age. Text B discusses treatment options for schizophrenia, particularly focusing on electroconvulsive therapy and other neuromodulation techniques in treating psychosis symptoms including those inherent in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Despite the different focuses (developmental aspects in Text A and treatment options in Text B), the underlying concept of schizophrenia as a diagnosable and treatable psychiatric condition has not shifted between the two texts. The core meaning of the term remains consistent, concerning the psychiatric disorder and its associated clinical characteristics."
88,Schizophrenia,"Disordered smooth-pursuit eye movements (SPEM) and, specifically, small anticipatory saccades that disrupt SPEM have been hypothesized to be a marker of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia.

However, diverse clinical presentations of NRXN1 mutations in patients raise the question of whether heterozygous NRXN1 mutations alone directly impair synaptic function. To address this question under conditions that precisely control for genetic background, we generated human ESCs with different heterozygous conditional NRXN1 mutations and analyzed two different types of isogenic control and NRXN1 mutant neurons derived from these ESCs. Both heterozygous NRXN1 mutations selectively impaired neurotransmitter release in human neurons without changing neuronal differentiation or synapse formation. Moreover, both NRXN1 mutations increased the levels of CASK, a critical synaptic scaffolding protein that binds to neurexin-1. Our results show that, unexpectedly, heterozygous inactivation of NRXN1 directly impairs synaptic function in human neurons, and they illustrate the value of this conditional deletion approach for studying the functional effects of disease-associated mutations.

Both texts discuss research linked to understanding or identifying factors related to schizophrenia. Text A focuses on studying eye movements as potential markers of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia, while Text B explores the genetic aspects and impacts of mutations associated with schizophrenia and related synaptic functions. In both texts, schizophrenia retains its fundamental referent - a neuropsychiatric disorder affecting cognitive and psychological function.

89,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia-like psychoses occur more frequently than expected in patients with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. We have analyzed pathological and clinical data from a series (n = 249) of temporal lobectomies to determine the factors that may relate to the development of schizophrenia-like psychosis. Schizophrenia-like psychoses did not occur at random; they were significantly associated with lesions that (1) originated in the fetus or perinatally, (2) affected neurons in the medial temporal lobe, and (3) gave an early age of first fit. Gangliogliomas--developmental lesions of the medial temporal lobe containing aberrant neurons--were disproportionately (p less than 0.001) associated with risk of psychosis. Schizophrenia-like psychoses arising preoperatively occurred more often (p = 0.1) with left-sided lesions. Asymmetry of lesion was not present in cases with postoperative psychoses. These findings are of interest in relation to recent studies suggesting that the structural abnormalities found in the brains of schizophrenics arise during fetal brain development.","Gesture is integrally linked with language and cognitive systems, and recent years have seen a growing attention to these movements in patients with schizophrenia.

- Reason: 
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" refers to a disorder related to the brain that affects cognition, thinking, and communication abilities. In Text A, schizophrenia-like psychosis is associated with brain lesions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting a linkage between structural brain abnormalities and the development of psychosis similar to schizophrenia. In Text B, the focus is on exploring how gestures, a cognitive and communicative behavior, are integrated with language systems in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in individuals who are at ultra-high risk (UHR) for developing psychosis. Both texts explore relationships between schizophrenia and neurological or cognitive indicators, maintaining the fundamental concept of schizophrenia as a complex brain-based disorder impacting cognition and communication.

91,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a chronic disease associated with a significant and long-lasting health, social, and financial burden, not only for patients but also for families, other caregivers, and the wider society. Many national and local studies have sought to estimate the societal burden of the illness--or some components of it--in monetary terms. Findings vary. We systematically reviewed the literature to locate all existing international estimates to date. Sixty-two relevant studies were found and summarized. Within- and between-country differences were analyzed descriptively. Despite the wide diversity of data sets and methods applied, all cost-of-illness estimates highlight the heavy societal burden of schizophrenia. Such information helps us to understand the health, health care, economic, and policy importance of schizophrenia, and to better interpret and explain the large within- and across-country differences that exist.","Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle is a behavioural response, which is used to estimate sensorimotor gating deficits in schizophrenia. Recent studies show that several behavioural effects of the psychotomimetic drug, phencyclidine (PCP), in rodents are blocked by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors suggesting that NO plays an important role in the pharmacological effects of PCP. The present study was conducted to examine the effects of PCP on prepulse inhibition in neuronal NOS (nNOS) deficient mice. PCP treatment caused a significant and dose-related increase in prepulse inhibition in nNOS-/- mice whereas prepulse inhibition was not significantly affected in +/+ and +/- mice. Basal prepulse inhibition level did not differ significantly between the groups. Furthermore, PCP caused a dose-related decrease in startle response reactivity in +/+ mice but did not significantly affect this measure in +/- and -/- mice. Basal startle response level did not differ between +/+ and +/- but was significantly lower in -/- mice.

### Reason:
The target word ""schizophrenia"" is used in both Text A and Text B to refer to a psychiatric disorder characterized by profound disruptions in thinking, affecting language, perception, and the sense of self. Both texts discuss schizophrenia within a scientific context and present it as a subject of medical and psychological study.

In Text A, schizophrenia is discussed in terms of its societal impact, emphasizing its chronic nature and the broad socio-economic burdens it imposes. This provides a clinical yet socio-economic perspective on schizophrenia, situating it as a major health issue that requires understanding and management.

In Text B, the focus shifts to a specific behavioral phenomenon associated with schizophrenia, namely sensorimotor gating deficits, and how these can be analyzed through experiments using prepulse inhibition in animal models. The text illustrates a scientific approach to studying the underlying mechanisms of schizophrenia, especially how certain drugs affect this condition in neuroscientific experiments.

Despite the different aspects and approaches to schizophrenia covered in the texts (socio-economic vs. neuroscientific research), the fundamental understanding of the term ""schizophrenia"" as a psychiatric disorder remains consistent. Both texts utilize the term to reference the same underlying mental health condition, with no significant shift in meaning or connotation between the two time periods. Thus, the semantic content of ""schizophrenia"" has remained unchanged."
92,Schizophrenia,"Erythrocyte deformability as a clinical indicator of microcirculatory disturbance was determined in the erythrocyte of 25 schizophrenic patients and of 18 normal controls. Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower erythrocyte deformability than did the normal controls (P < 0.001). This result suggests that microcirculation in schizophrenic patients is disturbed, and that this disturbance might be involved in the pathophysiological genesis of schizophrenia.","Clozapine (CLZ), an antipsychotic with a unique mechanism of action, is known to be superior to any other antipsychotic for schizophrenia. However, CLZ is also known to be associated with the development of lethal side effects, which include agranulocytosis and glucose intolerance (GI). Regular measurement and registration of blood test results have been mandatory for all CLZ users; however, these risks may still prevent therapists from prescribing CLZ. While CLZ-induced agranulocytosis has been well documented, CLZ-induced GI in the real world has not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this study, we used data registered in monitoring systems to investigate background factors associated with new-onset GI after CLZ administration and changes in HbA1c levels during CLZ treatment. Data of all patients with schizophrenia who were using CLZ from July 29, 2009 to January 20, 2016 were used for the analysis. Of the 3,746 patients enrolled in the study, 92 (2.5%) had GI at baseline; of the remaining 3,654 patients, 428 (11.7%) developed new-onset GI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the development of new-onset GI was significantly associated with older age, higher baseline HbA1c levels, and longer treatment duration. In patients with GI at baseline, HbA1c levels were maintained or improved over 18 months, while in the other patients, CLZ administration gradually elevated HbA1c levels. The findings of this study suggest that, although adequate monitoring and intervention is required, CLZ induction and maintenance therapy may be safe, even for patients with impaired glucose tolerance.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
The target word ""schizophrenia"" is used consistently in both Text A and Text B to refer to a mental health disorder characterized by disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions. In Text A, the focus is on the physical aspect of the condition, specifically how it might affect erythrocyte deformability and microcirculation in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The text discusses this as a factor in the pathology of schizophrenia, maintaining the primary association of the word with a psychological disorder that has physiological manifestations.

Text B, on the other hand, discusses the treatment of schizophrenia using the antipsychotic drug Clozapine (CLZ). It focuses on the efficacy of the drug, the associated risks of agranulocytosis and glucose intolerance, and the implications of these side effects for treatment management. The usage of the word ""schizophrenia"" in Text B also identifies it as a disorder but expands on how it is managed and the complications involved in its pharmacological treatment.

In both texts, despite the different focal points (physiological features in Text A and treatment-related issues in Text B), ""schizophrenia"" consistently describes a mental health disorder. The semantic meaning of the word as relating to a specific psychiatric condition remains unchanged. Thus, the use of ""schizophrenia"" holds the same fundamental connotation across both texts, specifying it as a mental disorder irrespective of the additional specific information provided about physiological implications or treatment considerations."
93,Schizophrenia,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of an opioid receptor-active, chromatographically separated endorphin fraction (Fraction I) were measured in 45 schizophrenic patients and 18 healthy volunteers. Significantly increased levels of Fraction I differentiated the patient group from controls, with no difference being found between newly admitted untreated and chronic previously neuroleptic-treated subjects. Fraction I levels did not correlate with age, weight, height, duration of illness, total time hospitalized, or age when symptoms first appeared. No differences were found between patients with or without a family history of schizophrenia. Fraction I levels were negatively correlated with ""hallucinations"" and ""indecision"" on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale. Increased levels of Fraction I were associated with low levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in drug-free schizophrenics. This relationship was not present after neuroleptic treatment or in healthy controls. No relationship was found between Fraction I and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Neuroleptic treatment did not significantly change Fraction I levels; when only patients above the control range were considered, however, a significant decrease was observed. The data support our previous hypothesis of an increased opioid activity in schizophrenia and further indicate a concomitant dysfunction of brain endorphin and dopamine activity in schizophrenic patients.","A subanesthetic dose of the noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine is known to induce a schizophrenia-like phenotype in humans and nonhuman primates alike. The transient behavioral changes mimic the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of the disease but the neural mechanisms behind these changes are poorly understood. A growing body of evidence indicates that the cognitive control processes associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions relies on groups of neurons synchronizing at narrow-band frequencies measurable in the local field potential (LFP). Here, we recorded LFPs from the caudo-lateral PFC of 2 macaque monkeys performing an antisaccade task, which requires the suppression of an automatic saccade toward a stimulus and the initiation of a goal-directed saccade in the opposite direction. Preketamine injection activity showed significant differences in a narrow 20-30 Hz beta frequency band between correct and error trials in the postsaccade response epoch. Ketamine significantly impaired the animals' performance and was associated with a loss of the differences in outcome-specific beta-band power. Instead, we observed a large increase in high-gamma-band activity. Our results suggest that the PFC employs beta-band synchronization to prepare for top-down cognitive control of saccades and the monitoring of task outcome.","- Label: Changed

- Reason:
  The use of the word ""schizophrenia"" in Text A and Text B demonstrates a significant semantic drift over time. In Text A, ""schizophrenia"" is examined predominantly from a biochemical perspective, focusing on specific markers related to opioid activity and their relationship with the disease’s symptoms, such as hallucinations or dopamine metabolism. This reflects an approach typical to earlier neuroscience research which often emphasized biochemical markers and their correlation with psychological manifestations.

  Text B, on the other hand, employs a more contemporary approach by emphasizing the cognitive and neural underpinnings of schizophrenia-like symptoms induced by pharmacological means (ketamine). The focus here shifts from classical biomarkers to specific cognitive processes—like attention control and saccade command regulation—and the corresponding neural synchronies, particularly within the prefrontal cortex, explored through frequencies in local field potential recordings. This indicates a broader and more nuanced understanding of schizophrenia, concentrating not just on chemical imbalances or structural anomalies but also on functional neural dynamics and cognitive impairments.

  The shift from a biochemical lens to a more integrated cognitive-neuroscience perspective, showing the relationship between cognitive deficits, brain function, and symptom manifestations, suggests a clear semantic drift in how ""schizophrenia"" is understood and studied within psychiatric and neurological sciences."
94,Schizophrenia,"We investigated the effect of 10 months ovariectomy and a correction therapy, 2 weeks before the rats were killed, of oestradiol, progesterone or their combination on NMDA and AMPA receptor binding in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, striatum, nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex of the rat brain as well as on amino acid levels in frontal cortex. NMDA and AMPA binding densities were assayed by autoradiography using, respectively, L-[3H]glutamate and [3H]AMPA; amino acid concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatograhy (HPLC) coupled with UV detection. Ovariectomy was without effect on NMDA and AMPA binding density in all brain regions assayed except in the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus where it decreased NMDA binding density compared to intact rats values. Oestradiol restored and increased NMDA binding density in the CA1 subfield and the dentate gyrus of ovariectomized rats but, by contrast, it decreased binding density in the striatum and in the frontal cortex while having no effect in the CA2/3 subfield of the hippocampus and in the nucleus accumbens. Oestradiol was without effect on AMPA binding density in the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus but it reduced AMPA binding density in the striatum, the frontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Progesterone, and oestradiol combined with progesterone, decreased NMDA but not AMPA binding density in the frontal cortex of ovariectomized rats, and they were without effect on these receptors in the other brain regions assayed. Amino acid concentrations in the frontal cortex were unchanged after ovariectomy or steroid treatments. The effect of oestradiol in the hippocampus confirmed in the present study and our novel findings in the frontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens may have functional significance for schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases.","Recent studies have revealed an altered expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of schizophrenic patients. Despite extensive considerations, the alteration of NKCC1 and KCC2 co-transporters at different stages of development has not been fully studied. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these transporters in PFC and hippocampus at time points of four, eight, and twelve weeks in post-weaning social isolation rearing rat model. For this purpose, 23-25 days-old rats were classified into social- or isolation-reared groups. The levels of NKCC1 and KCC2 mRNA expression were evaluated at hippocampus or PFC regions at the time-points of four, eight, and twelve weeks following housing. Post-weaning isolation rearing decreased the hippocampal KCC2 mRNA expression level, but does not affect the NKCC1 mRNA expression. However, no significant difference was observed in the PFC mRNA levels of NKCC1 and KCC2 in the isolation-reared group compared to the socially-reared group during the course of modeling. Further, we assessed the therapeutic effect of selective NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (10 mg/kg), on improvement of prepulse inhibition (PPI) test on twelve weeks isolation-reared rats. Intraperitoneal administration of bumetanide (10 mg/kg) did not exert beneficial effects on PPI deficit. Our findings show that isolation rearing reduces hippocampal KCC2 expression level and may underlie hippocampal GABA excitatory. In addition, 10 mg/kg bumetanide is not effective in improving the reduced PPI of twelve weeks isolation-reared rats. Collectively, our findings show that hippocampal chloride transporter KCC2 contributes to excitatory GABA dysregulation in the developmental rat model of schizophrenia.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the word ""schizophrenia"" remains firmly rooted in the context of psychiatric or neurological studies, specifically within the framework of biochemical and molecular investigations into brain function. Text A discusses the impact of hormonal changes on various brain regions which can affect conditions like schizophrenia, while Text B explores changes in transporter expression in schizophrenia models. Both texts utilize ""schizophrenia"" within a scientific, research-oriented discourse about brain functions and abnormalities associated with the disorder. Thus, the context and connotation of the target word ""schizophrenia"" have not significantly shifted between the two texts."
95,Schizophrenia,"This review of the literature suggests that antipsychotic drug response is determined by dopamine (DA) turnover and norepinephrine (NE) activity prior to treatment. The data suggest that NE modulates the DA system. Drug-free psychotic patients with relatively increased DA and NE activity, including release, are more likely to be treatment responsive, while patients who show evidence of enhanced DA and NE activity during treatment with antipsychotic drugs are likely to relapse soon after neuroleptic withdrawal. Basal release of DA and NE is decreased and associated with residual positive and negative symptoms. Improvement during neuroleptic treatment is associated with decreases in DA and NE phasic or stimulus induced release. The variable response to antipsychotic drugs is most likely to be a result of dysregulated DA and NE release, i.e. under state-dependent control, rather than evidence of a heterogeneous aetiology. Because catecholamines regulate gain, signal-to-noise ratio and gating in the brain, this model allows for environmental factors to interact with biochemical state and drug treatment. The author proposes that impaired homeostasis of NE and DA in schizophrenia causes instability in NE and DA neuronal firing and release, presumably related to mechanisms down-stream from the receptors, such as G proteins. This instability of catecholamine release may explain the observed variability in clinical states and drug response in schizophrenia.","Several clinical trials have demonstrated that linkage to an outreach service can prevent prolonged length of stay of patients at psychiatric hospitals. However, there has been no investigation of the association between length of stay in psychiatric hospital and regional supply of outreach services using national case mix data. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between length of stay in psychiatric hospital and regional supply of outreach services. We used data from the National Patient Survey in Japan, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of inpatient care conducted every three years from 1996 to 2014. Data from 42,268 patients with schizophrenia who had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals were analyzed. After controlling for patient and regional characteristics, patients in regions with fewer number of visits for psychiatric nursing care at home had significantly longer length of stay in psychiatric hospitals. This finding implies that enhancement of the regional supply of outreach services would prevent prolonged length of stay in psychiatric hospitals.","### Answer:
- Target word: Schizophrenia
- Text A: Discusses schizophrenia in the context of biochemical processes, focusing on dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) dynamics, and their implications in treatment responses and the variability in patient outcomes. The text heavily emphasizes the neurological and biochemical aspects of schizophrenia, explaining mechanisms and drug interactions.
- Text B: Treats schizophrenia in a socio-medical context, analyzing how external healthcare services and their availability affect patient outcomes, specifically the duration of hospital stays. Emphasis is on healthcare systems and their effectiveness in managing schizophrenia through supportive services.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the word 'schizophrenia' is used predominantly to discuss internal biochemical mechanisms and individual responses to medication, focusing on its neurochemical aspects. In Text B, 'schizophrenia' is referred to in the broader context of healthcare management and service provision, highlighting the socio-medical perspective. Thus, the shift from internal biochemical mechanisms to a broader socio-medical approach in the usage and context of the word ""schizophrenia"" indicates significant semantic drift."
96,Schizophrenia,"Twenty-four male schizophrenics, 12 (SFH) with schizophrenia in the immediate family and 12 (SNFH) with no evidence of schizophrenia in the family background, and 24 male control subjects, 12 highly educated (HEC), and 12 minimally educated (MEC), were assessed for premorbid social adjustment and were administered the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a size estimation task, and the EEG average evoked response (AER) at different levels of stimulus intensity. As predicted from the stimulus redundancy formulation, the SFH patients were poorer in premorbid adjustment, were less often paranoid, functioned at a lower level of cognitive efficiency (poor digit symbol and greater absolute error on size estimation), were more chronic, and, in some respects, had size estimation indices of minimal scanning. Contrary to prediction, the SFH group had the strongest and most sustained augmenting response on AER, while the SNFH group shifted from an augmenting to a reducing pattern of response. The relationship between an absence of AER reducing and the presence of cognitive impairment in the SFH group was a major focus of discussion.","Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1) is a member of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules. CHL1 gene is located on human chromosome 3 and has been linked to several pathologies, including 3p deletion syndrome, schizophrenia, and tumor growth and metastasis.","###Label: Unchanged

###Reason:
In the provided texts, the usage of the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains a similar medical or clinical connotation in both periods. 

- In Text A from the first period, ""schizophrenia"" is clearly used in a psychiatric or psychological research context, discussing the characteristics, family history, and cognitive effects on patients identified as schizophrenics. This implies a focus on the disorder's clinical aspects and its impact on cognitive functions and social behaviors.

- In Text B from a later period, the word ""schizophrenia"" is still used within a medical or scientific context, though the focus shifts slightly to genetic associations and the linkage of the CHL1 gene with the disorder. This still pertains to the understanding and investigation of schizophrenia as a health condition, particularly in relation to genetic factors.

Despite the slight difference in focus – from psychological and behavioral aspects to genetic links – the core usage of ""schizophrenia"" as a term defining a specific psychiatric disorder has not changed. Both contexts reflect a clinical and medical inquiry into the nature and implications of the condition, indicating that there has been no significant semantic drift in the term ""schizophrenia"" across the periods considered."
97,Schizophrenia,"The present study examined the effects of pre-exposure of an irrelevant stimulus on reaction time and the contingent negative variation (CNV) in healthy controls and schizophrenic patients. In Phase I, subjects were either pre-exposed (PE) or not pre-exposed (NPE) to repeated presentations of an auditory probe stimulus (white noise), while engaged in counting auditory nonsense syllables. In Phase II, all subjects were required to produce a rapid motor response to a visual imperative stimulus that was preceded by the previously irrelevant auditory stimulus. During Phase II in controls, for PE as compared to NPE subjects, the build-up of CNV across trials was delayed. In schizophrenics, for both PE and NPE subjects, there was no pre-exposure effect on the CNV component. These findings indicate that ERPs may be useful in explicating the normal latent inhibition effect (poor associative learning to a stimulus after it has been passively pre-exposed) and its disruption in schizophrenia.","Vocational impairments in schizophrenia have been widely linked to deficits in neurocognition. This study examined the possibility that deficits in visuomotor processing speed and flexibility in abstract thought may in combination be an especially potent risk factor for poorer levels of work performance in rehabilitation. Fifty-seven participants with confirmed diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum disorders were administered the Digit Symbol Subtest and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and then offered work placements in a vocational rehabilitation program. Work performance was assessed biweekly over two months using the Work Behavior Inventory. Multivariate and univariate repeated ANOVA revealed that participants classified as having no impairments in either visuomotor processing speed and flexibility in abstract thought (n=14) had superior work performance compared to participants with deficits in either one area (n=20) or both areas (n=23). Additionally, participants with no impairments were the only group to show significant improvement in work performance over 7 weeks of rehabilitation. Participants with only one deficit had significantly better work performance than participants with both deficits but showed no statistically significant improvement in work performance. Results suggest assessments of these domains of neurocognition may provide important information about individual needs for adjunct services.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the usage of the word ""schizophrenia"" pertains to its meaning as a psychiatric disorder. In Text A, schizophrenia is discussed in the context of experimental psychology, examining cognitive responses and associative learning disruptions typically seen in patients with schizophrenia. Similarly, in Text B, schizophrenia is explored within the framework of vocational impairments and neurocognitive deficits associated with the disorder, focusing on how these impact work performance in rehabilitation settings. In both texts, the core concept of schizophrenia as a mental health disorder with various cognitive and functional implications remains consistent. Thus, the term has not experienced a significant shift in meaning between the different time periods and contexts presented."
98,Schizophrenia,"Research on the optimal pharmacotherapy for people with schizophrenia and co-occurring substance use disorders remains in its infancy. This report reviews existing data and provides an update on recent research. The confluence of findings is consistent with a model of a reward dysfunction inherent in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, leading to a heightened vulnerability of people with schizophrenia to substance use disorders. Studies indicate that patients with dual disorders have difficulty tolerating conventional antipsychotics, have higher rates of medication nonadherence, and have greater impulsivity and sensation seeking. Limited evidence suggests that clozapine treatment may be associated with reduced substance abuse, with weaker evidence suggesting that other novel antipsychotics may have similar, but potentially less potent, effects. Controlled trials to test the effects of these medications are underway. A number of recent studies indicate that bupropion can facilitate reduced tobacco smoking among patients with schizophrenia. The preferential use of novel antipsychotics, a lower threshold for prescription of clozapine, the use of bupropion for smoking cessation, careful monitoring of compliance, and possible use of other medications for substance use disorders when indicated are recommended in pharmacologic management for people with co-occurring substance use disorders and schizophrenia.","Childhood adversity is associated with cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. However, findings to date are inconsistent and little is known about the relationship between social cognition and childhood trauma. We investigated the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect and cognitive function in patients with a first-episode of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder (n = 56) and matched healthy controls (n = 52). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing this relationship in patients and controls exposed to similarly high levels of trauma.","### Label: Unchanged

### Reason: 
In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" retains its core meaning related to a psychiatric disorder characterized by disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions. 

- In Text A, the focus is on exploring pharmacotherapy for individuals with schizophrenia who also have co-occurring substance use disorders. It discusses the challenges and potential treatments, emphasizing the complexity of managing schizophrenia with comorbid conditions.
  
- In Text B, the discussion shifts to the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia, particularly in the context of childhood adversity. This text explores the impact of external factors like trauma on the cognitive functions in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders.

In both texts, despite the difference in specific focus (pharmacological management in Text A versus cognitive impairments and external influences in Text B), the underlying concept of ""schizophrenia"" as a serious mental health condition remains consistent. There is no indication of a change in the definition or perception of the disorder itself, only different aspects of its research and implications being discussed. Thus, the semantic meaning of “schizophrenia” has not drifted significantly between the periods covered by Text A and Text B."
99,Schizophrenia,"Standard auditory evoked potentials (AEP) were recorded in 50 schizophrenic patients and 47 normal controls. All patients were rated on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and were classified in three groups (positive-type [n = 10], negative-type [n = 23]and mixed-type [n = 17]patients) according to the normative criteria suggested by Kay. The mean latencies of AEP components (N1, P2, N2) and mean peak-to-peak amplitudes (N1P2, P2N2) did not correlate with age, duration of illness, length of hospitalisation or neuroleptic dosage. The evoked response did not differ between the three groups of patients (positive, negative and mixed). There was only a trend (P = 0.075) to a longer N1 latency in the negative-type group and a shorter one in the positive-type group than in the mixed-type and the control groups. The latency of N1 component correlated significantly with negative symptoms of schizophrenia (SANS scores). This correlation was related to the severity of a depressive dimension of the disorder reflected by the ""depressive factor"" of BPRS or ""affective flattening"" and ""avolition"" subscales of SANS.","Facial affect processing (FAP) deficits in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) have been widely reported; although effect sizes vary across studies, and there are limited direct comparisons of the two groups. Further, there is debate as to the influence of both psychotic and mood symptoms on FAP. This study aimed to address these limitations by recruiting groups of psychosis patients with either a diagnosis of SZ or BD and comparing them to healthy controls (HC) on a well validated battery of four FAP subtests: affect discrimination, name affect, select affect and match affect. Overall, both groups performed more poorly than controls in terms of accuracy. In SZ, this was largely driven by impairments on three of the four subtests. The BD patients showed impaired performance specifically on the match affect subtest, a task that had a high cognitive load. FAP performance in the psychosis patients was correlated with severity of positive symptoms and mania. This study confirmed that FAP deficits are a consistent finding in SZ that occur independent of task specific methodology; whilst FAP deficits in BD are more subtle. Further work in this group is needed to replicate these results. ","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""schizophrenia"" (SZ) retains its core semantic and clinical usage as a specific category of mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (e.g., affective flattening and avolition). Text A focuses on auditory evoked potentials in individuals with schizophrenia, examining the correlations with symptom types, whereas Text B delves into facial affect processing deficits in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, comparing them with healthy controls. Both texts engage with the disorder in the context of clinical and psychological studies, maintaining consistent clinical features and symptomatic descriptions. The meaning and the connotations associated with ""schizophrenia"" as a mental health condition have remained consistently tied to its psychiatric definition and implications in both texts, despite the focus on different aspects of symptom manifestations and research contexts."
0,Depression,"Studying community residing youths originally recruited for an intervention trial upon entry into first grade, this project sought to estimate risk of suicide ideation and attempts to young adulthood, with focus on those who used drugs before age 16, as compared to youths who used later in development or not at all. Standardized interview assessments in 1989-1994 were completed with 2311 youths age 8-15. Roughly 15 years after recruitment, our study team reassessed 1695, nearly 75% of the survivors (mean age = 21), finding 155 to have made suicide attempts (SA) and 218 with onset of depression-related suicide ideation (SI). We estimate relative risk (RR), from survival analysis and logistic regression models, to study early use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and inhalants, with covariate adjustments for age, sex, race-ethnicity, and other pertinent covariates. Early-onset of cannabis use and inhalant use for females, but not for males, signaled modestly excess risk of suicide attempt (cannabis-associated RR = 1.9; p = 0.04; inhalant-associated RR = 2.2; p = 0.05). Early-onset of cannabis use by females (but not for males) signaled excess risk for suicide ideation (RR = 2.9; p = 0.006). Early-onset alcohol and tobacco use were not associated with later risk of SA or SI. In light of the relatively modest strength of association, the evidence may well reflect an underlying common diathesis or unmeasured prior confounding influences that link early-onset illegal drug use with later risk of these suicide-related events, rather than an influence of early-onset drug use per se.","Obesity has been linked to cognitive decline and adverse effects on brain health. Zinc (Zn) is a mineral with important metabolic functions that can modulate obesity-related neurological impairment. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of Zn supplementation on the inflammatory profile, cognitive function, and mood of overweight or obese women through a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study included 42 women aged between 40 and 60, randomly divided into two groups: Zn supplementation (30 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Data regarding sociodemographic, anthropometric, dietary, and physical activity were collected. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), verbal fluency test, clock drawing test, and Stroop test were performed. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Beck anxiety inventory and the BDI-II, respectively. Saliva samples were collected to evaluate IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, insulin, nitrite, and Zn levels. Of the 42 participants (mean age 49.58 ± 6.46 years), 32 were included in the study analyses. Changes in body weight and macronutrient consumption were not different between placebo and Zn supplementation groups. Cognitive scores on the MMSE and Stroop tests were higher in the Zn supplementation group than in the placebo group. Salivary levels of IL-1b and Zn increased in the Zn group compared to placebo. There was no significant change in the adjusted means of the BDI-II and BECK scores between the zinc vs. placebo groups. Twelve weeks of Zn supplementation was able to partially improve the cognitive scores assessed in overweight or obese women, regardless of weight loss. These findings suggest that Zn supplementation can be considered an adjunct strategy to enhance cognitive health in overweight or obese women.","###Answer:

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the sentiment toward the word ""depression"" remains mostly consistent, where it signifies a psychological condition characterized by significant mood dysregulation that can be linked to various behaviors, health conditions, or cognitive dysfunctions. Text A relates it more directly to suicide ideation and attempts as a severe implication, whereas Text B measures depression as part of a broader study on mental health and cognitive functions but without altering the fundamental understanding of depression as a mental health disorder."
1,Depression,"58 acute hospitalized CVD patients were selected as study group. Each patient was administered a series of standardized quantitative measures. As a result, we found a significant difference between hemisphere (L: 55% vs R: 28% P < 0.05), and the difference was result from the highest incidence rate of PSD observed in the left anterior CVD subgroup. Meanwhile, those with left anterior lesion (cortical and subcortical) had the greater severity of depression than any other lesions. A strong negative correlation between the severity of depression and AP% was observed for left CVD group. The result of multiple stepwise regression analysis not only support the notions mentioned above but also shown up that a few factors other than location of the lesion had impact on the PSD. Finally, authors discussed the heterogenous causes of PSD and think probably biological etiology involved in the formation of PSD.","A total of 163 soil samples (0-20 cm layer) were collected from the grid sampling plots (80 m x 80 m) in Huanjiang Observation and Research Station of Karst Ecosystem in a small catchment in Karst cluster-peak depression area, South China. By using classical statistics and geostatistics, the spatial heterogeneity of mineral components (SiO2, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, Al2O3, MnO, and TiO2) in the soils were studied. The contents of the seven soil mineral components in the study area differed greatly, being in the order of SiO2 > Al2O3 > CaO > MgO > Fe2O3 > TiO2 > MnO, and the variance coefficients also varied obviously, in the order of CaO > MgO > Fe2O3 > TiO2 > SiO2 > Al2O3 > MnO. The seven mineral components accounted for 69.4% of the total soil mass. The spatial patterns and the fittest models of the seven soil mineral components differed from each other. All the seven soil mineral components had a strong spatial autocorrelation, with shorter variation ranges and stronger spatial dependence. The Kriging contour maps indicated that the distribution patterns of soil SiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, MnO, and TiO2 were similar, being higher in south and east, lower in north and west, higher in depression, and lower in slope, while the distribution patterns of soil CaO and MgO were in adverse. Natural conditions (vegetation, bare rock rate, slope degree, and slope aspect, etc. ) and human disturbance were the most important factors affecting the spatial patterns of the soil mineral components.","###Answer:

This is a traditional and well-understood use of the term in medical and psychological contexts. In Text B, on the other hand, ""depression"" refers to a geographical feature, specifically a low-lying area or a basin within a landscape, which is a completely different context and meaning unrelated to psychological or emotional states.

2,Depression,"Indices of vagal and sympathetic activity were studied in 30 elderly males, to elucidate their possible roles in causing hypotension during spinal analgesia. The technique of spinal analgesia and the regimen of intravenous fluids were standardised. An index of vagal activity was derived from the degree of heart rate variation (successive RR interval change) on ECG recordings. Sympathetic activity was evaluated by changes in the skin conductance (SCR) of 15 patients. Analgesia to pinprick reached a median dermatome level of T5-6 (range T2-T10) by 15 min. Hypotension was correlated with the level of analgesia, and was more likely when spinal analgesia was higher than T5. There was no correlation between vagal activity and the degree of hypotension. The depression of skin conductance responses was not correlated with the degree of hypotension nor with vagal activity. Vagal efferent activity, measured at the heart, does not seem to play a causative role in hypotension occurring during spinal analgesia.","To evaluate depression, stress, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviours in the Lebanese population in response to COVID-19 pandemic.","###Answer:

3,Depression,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat a number of psychiatric disorders related to mood and anxiety, and variations in the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene may be involved in a number of these. A polymorphic site in the promoter region is associated with differences in 5-HTT gene expression. Studies suggest that the short allele of the 5-HTT promoter (5-HTTPR) site can adversely influence the antidepressant response to SSRIs, and is associated with anxiety-related traits, depression, and impulsive disorders such as alcohol abuse. Several studies do not replicate these findings; potential confounding factors include age, gender, and population stratification. Other 5-HTT polymorphisms also exist. For example, individuals with the short allele of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism, located in the second intron, may have reduced responsiveness to SSRIs, and the STin2.12 allele at this site has been associated with bipolar disorder. Findings both supporting and inconsistent with these conclusions are reviewed. The clinical effects of the polymorphisms may be associated with effects on platelets, neural 5-HTT levels, and indices of serotonergic function.","compare the quality of life (QOL) of aged residents in homes for aged people with or without symptoms of depression, and identify social, physical activity; leisure; health and basic activities of daily living (ADL) variables that correlate with QOL scores.","- Target word: Depression

4,Depression,"Although several studies have examined the relationship between symptoms of depression or psychological distress and medication adherence, this is the first published study of HIV antiretroviral adherence and its correlates among persons diagnosed with serious mental illness. Forty-five of 47 (96%) participants completed a two-week study in which their adherence to antiretroviral medication was measured using electronic monitoring caps. Mean adherence (proportion of prescribed doses taken) was 66% (SD=34). There were several correlates (p<0.05) of adherence among background and medical characteristics, physical symptoms and side effects, cognitive and psychosocial functioning, and treatment-related attitudes and beliefs. However, in a forward stepwise regression, attendance at recent clinical appointments was the sole predictor that entered the model--accounting for 49% of the variance in adherence. Using attendance at recent clinic appointments as the criterion, adherence readiness (90+% adherence to antiretrovirals) was correctly determined for 72% of the sample. Although not sufficient to serve as the basis for treatment decision making, review of appointment-keeping records may provide clinicians with a simple, cost-effective method for predicting adherence to ongoing treatment, as well as for evaluating adherence readiness to inform the decision of whether to prescribe or defer treatment.","Depression risk is exacerbated by genetic factors and stress exposure; however, the biological mechanisms through which these factors interact to confer depression risk are poorly understood. One putative biological mechanism implicates variability in the ability of cortisol, released in response to stress, to trigger a cascade of adaptive genomic and non-genomic processes through glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Here, we demonstrate that common genetic variants in long-range enhancer elements modulate the immediate transcriptional response to GR activation in human blood cells. These functional genetic variants increase risk for depression and co-heritable psychiatric disorders. Moreover, these risk variants are associated with inappropriate amygdala reactivity, a transdiagnostic psychiatric endophenotype and an important stress hormone response trigger. Network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of functionally related stress-sensitive genes in blood and brain.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: This text discusses the concept of depression primarily in the context of HIV antiretroviral adherence among individuals with serious mental illness. It mentions ""symptoms of depression or psychological distress"" alongside various factors affecting adherence to medication. Here, ""depression"" clearly refers to the clinical psychological condition affecting mood and behavior, influencing patients' compliance with medical treatment.
  
- Text B: The second text explores how genetic factors and stress exposure contribute to the risk of depression, focusing on biological mechanisms like the response to cortisol via glucocorticoid receptor activation. The usage of ""depression"" here pertains to the medical and psychiatric perspective as a mental health disorder influenced by genetic, neuronal, and hormonal factors.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the word ""depression"" maintains its reference to the clinical and psychiatric condition affecting mental health, with no significant shift in its foundational meaning between the two periods. The contexts differ slightly in focus—treatment adherence and genetic mechanisms—but the core concept of depression as a psychological condition remains consistent across both samples."
5,Depression,"Microinjections of carbachol into the pons induce a state that resembles rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in intact cats and, in decerebrate, artificially ventilated cats, produce postural atonia accompanied by a powerful depression of the respiratory motor output. In this study, pontine carbachol was used in decerebrate, spontaneously breathing cats to assess the effects of mechanical and chemical respiratory reflexes on the magnitude and pattern of the carbachol-induced depression of breathing, and to determine whether the depression is altered in those animals in which rapid eye movements are present. Phrenic nerve activity and tidal volume were only transiently depressed at the onset of the carbachol-induced postural atonia, whereas the decrease in respiratory rate and the depressions of hypoglossal and intercostal activities persisted until the response was reversed by a pontine microinjection of atropine 15-101 minutes after the onset of carbachol response. Ventilation was reduced to 70% of control during the steady-state conditions. The irregularity of breathing, characterized by the inter-quartile ranges of the distributions of the peak phrenic nerve activity and respiratory timing, did not increase following pontine carbachol. Neither vagotomy nor vigorous eye movements were associated with increased breathing irregularity. This contrasts with the irregular breathing (with minor average changes in ventilation) typical of natural REM sleep. We propose that the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat provides a useful model of the depressant effects that neural events associated with REM sleep may have on breathing.","New frontiers for host-microbe interactions continue to emerge as our knowledge of the adult gut microbiome in health and disease is continually supplemented and improved. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are now linked to symptom severity while population-based evidence linking gut microbiome signatures to depression is an important new landmark. The effects of drugs on gut microbiome composition are also becoming clearer. Meanwhile, preclinical studies have delineated the influence of the gut microbiome at a structural and activity level in distinct brain regions. Bacterial metabolites, such as tryptamine, can activate specific receptors to impact gastrointestinal motility. These recent studies bring into focus the future implications for therapeutic targeting of the microbiome-gut-brain axis.","###Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Describes ""depression"" in a physiological context, specifically referring to the decreased activity or suppression of breathing and other motor functions in cats induced by microinjections of carbachol. Here, ""depression"" pertains to a physical reduction or diminishment in physiological activity.
- Text B: Uses ""depression"" in the psychological and mental health context, specifically referring to a mood disorder characterized by feelings of sadness, low mood, and a lack of interest in life generally. This is evident from the connection made between gut microbiome signatures and the mood disorder known as depression.

- Reason: The semantic use of the word ""depression"" has shifted significantly from a physiological context in Text A (referring to a lowering or suppression of physical functions) to a psychological or health-related context in Text B (referring to a mood disorder). This indicates a noticeable semantic drift or change in usage over time, illustrating different dimensions and implications of the term in varied contexts."
6,Depression,"The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism that induces an improvement in exercise capacity by nitrates in patients with stable effort angina pectoris. The study population was composed of 19 patients: group A, 10 patients with chronic stable effort angina who had a well-developed coronary collateral circulation to the potentially ischemic region; group B, 9 patients with chronic stable effort angina who had no collateral circulation to the jeopardized myocardium. Treadmill exercise was performed according to the standard Bruce protocol with and without pretreatment with orally administered 10 mg isosorbide dinitrate. Percent increases (mean +/- SE) in exercise duration were not significantly different between groups A and B (25 +/- 6 vs. 14 +/- 6%). Percent increases in the maximal rate-pressure product tended to be greater in group A than in group B (27 +/- 6 vs. 10 +/- 6%). Percent increases in the rate-pressure product at the onset of angina pectoris were significantly greater in group A than in group B (37 +/- 7 vs. 7 +/- 6%; p less than 0.01). Percent increases in the rate-pressure product at 0.1 mV S-T segment depression were also significantly greater in group A than in group B (26 +/- 6 vs. 1 +/- 5%; p less than 0.01). These results suggest that isosorbide dinitrate dilates epicardial collateral vessels with smooth muscle layers, but fails to dilate the coronary arteries with significant organic stenoses.","Research on routine outcome monitoring in psychotherapy settings is plentiful but not without implementation obstacles. In fact, there is a relative dearth of real-time outcome monitoring in substance use treatment settings. Numerous barriers to the development and implementation of clinical decision support tools and outcome monitoring of substance use patients, including the need to establish expected trajectories of change and use of reliable change indices have been identified (Goodman, McKay, & DePhilippis, 2013 ). The current study was undertaken to develop expected trajectories of change and to demonstrate the treatment effectiveness of a dual diagnosis intensive outpatient program. The expected trajectories of change for days of substance use and depression scores were developed using predictive equation models from derivation samples and then applied to cross-validation samples. Predictive equations to monitor substance use were developed and validated for all patients and for only patients who were actively using substance at the time of admission, as well as to monitor severity of their depression symptom on a weekly basis. Validation of the equations was assessed through the use of Cohen's kappa (κ), receiver operating characteristic curves, reliable change index, and percentage improvement. Large effect sizes for reductions in substance use (Cohen's d = .76) and depressive symptoms (d = 1.10) are reported. The best predictive models we developed had absolute accuracy rates ranging from 95 to 100%. The findings from this study indicate that predictive equations for depressive symptoms and days of substance use can be derived and validated on dual diagnosis samples.","### Answer:

7,Depression,"This article describes the development of the Attachment and Object Relations Inventory (AORI). The AORI, a dimensional measure based on factor structure, was developed in response to the psychometric problems typical to attachment style measures that are categorical in nature. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were high. A factor analysis of the 75 AORI items confirmed the existence of at least 6 factors and explained approximately 50% of the item variance. Convergent and discriminant validity of the AORI was supported through appropriate relationships with measures of depression, anxiety, and personality, and other measures of attachment and object relations.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome in 61 patients with medication-overuse headache (MOH) who 4 years previously had been included in a randomized open-label prospective multicentre study. Sixty patients still alive after 4 years were invited to a follow-up investigation. Fifty patients (83%) participated. Sixteen visited a neurologist, 22 were interviewed through telephone, 2 gave response by a letter, and 10 were evaluated through hospital records. The influence of baseline characteristics on outcome 4 years later was evaluated by non-parametric tests. p values below 0.01 were considered significant. At follow-up, the 50 persons had a mean reduction of 6.5 headache days/month (p < 0.001) and 9.5 acute headache medication days/month (p < 0.001) compared to baseline. Headache index/month was reduced from 449 to 321 (p < 0.001). Sixteen persons (32%) were considered as responders due to a ≥50% reduction in headache frequency from baseline, whereas 17 (34%) persons met the criteria for MOH. None of the baseline characteristics consistently influenced all five outcome measures. Total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score at baseline was predictors (p < 0.005) for being a responder after 4 years. At 4 years' follow-up, one-third of the 50 MOH patients had ≥50% reduction in headache frequency from baseline. A low total HADS score at baseline was associated with the most favorable outcome.","- Target word: Depression

- Text A: Here, the word ""depression"" refers to the emotional and mood-related conditions measured through a psychometric assessment tool (AORI). The context suggests that ""depression"" is used in the sense of psychological or psychiatric condition, potentially involving feelings of sadness, low mood, and other related symptoms, which are standard uses related to mental health.

- Text B: In this scenario, ""depression"" is identified through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, again referring to the psychiatric or emotional condition of the MOH patients, used to assess mood and emotional well-being. The use of ""depression"" is also in a similar context relating to mental health, influenced by anxiety, and how it predicts outcomes in a longitudinal study.

- **Reason**: In both texts, the term ""depression"" relates consistently to its use as a descriptor of a mental health condition, specifically referring to mood and emotional disorders. There is no indication of a shift in meaning or context that would suggest a variation in the understanding or application of the term between the two different texts from presumably different time periods. Both applications deal with assessment, implications, and outcomes of mental health issues, maintaining a similar thematic use of the word."

9,Depression,"1. A study has been made of the effects of changing the external calcium concentration [Ca](o) on the binomial parameters p and n that control the average quantal content (m) of the end-plate potential (e.p.p.) during trains of nerve impulses at synapses in amphibian striated muscle.2. In high external calcium concentrations (0.4 mM </= [Ca](o) < 1.0 mM) the increase in m of a test impulse following a conditioning impulse at different intervals (< 100 msec) was due to an increase in the number of quanta available for release, n; the increase in m of successive e.p.p.s in a short high frequency train was primarily due to an increase in n.3. In high external calcium concentrations (1.0 mM </= [Ca](o) < 10 mM) there was a decrease in m of a test impulse following a short high frequency conditioning train (4-5 impulses, 20-100 Hz) at different intervals (200 msec < 5 sec) and this was due to a decrease in the number of quanta available for release, n; in a long high frequency train (20 impulses, 20-100 Hz) there was an increase in m for the first few successive e.p.p.s followed by a depression of m which eventually reached a steady state and these changes in m were due to changes in n; the higher the frequency the greater was the depression in n during the steady-state period.4. In high calcium concentrations, the steady-state m reached in the first 20 impulses during continual stimulation at high frequency gave way to a decline in m over several minutes until a new depressed steady-state value of m was reached and this was maintained during the longest periods of stimulation (30 min); this decline in m was primarily due to a decline in the number of quanta available for release.5. These changes in the number of quanta available for release during trains of impulses are predicted in terms of a hypothesis in which facilitation is due to the accumulation of a residual calcium-receptor complex in the nerve terminal that determines the fraction of a pool of quanta which contributes to n, and depression is due to a decrease in the number of quanta in this pool.","Depression is common among people with diabetes, negatively affecting quality of life, treatment adherence and diabetes outcomes.

10,Depression,"We reviewed data from approximately 80 published and unpublished studies that examined the association of religious affiliation or involvement with depressive symptoms or depressive disorder. In these studies, religion was measured as religious affiliation; general religious involvement; organizational religious involvement; prayer or private religious involvement; religious salience and motivation; or religious beliefs. People from some religious affiliations appear to have an elevated risk for depressive symptoms and depressive disorder, and people with no religious affiliation are at an elevated risk in comparison with people who are religiously affiliated. People with high levels of general religious involvement, organizational religious involvement, religious salience, and intrinsic religious motivation are at reduced risk for depressive symptoms and depressive disorders. Private religious activity and particular religious beliefs appear to bear no reliable relationship with depression. People with high levels of extrinsic religious motivation are at increased risk for depressive symptoms. Although these associations tend to be consistent, they are modest and are substantially reduced in multivariate research. Longitudinal research is sparse, but suggests that some forms of religious involvement might exert a protective effect against the incidence and persistence of depressive symptoms or disorders. The existing research is sufficient to encourage further investigation of the associations of religion with depressive symptoms and disorder.

11,Depression,"The choice of reserpine as practically the sole model substance used in research in depression over two decades was not dictated by rational considerations alone: hypothetical notions, prospects of the rapid realization of experimental research aims and the fascination of the exotic origin of this ""natural"" drug made a significant contribution.","A symposium held at the 31st European College of Neuropsychopharmacology congress in October 2018 in Barcelona, Spain discussed patients' expectations of treatment of their depression and how these can be integrated into patient management. Since treatment non-compliance is a major problem in patients suffering from depression, it is important to identify patients' expectations to improve treatment compliance and in turn efficacy. Currently, there is no established protocol for choosing the right antidepressant therapy, and physicians need to tailor the choice based on the type of depression, its predominant symptoms, medical and psychiatric history of patients, and their previous response to, and adverse events with, treatment. Treatment strategies also need to be adapted to each patient's personality/persona and their personal beliefs, and patients need to be aware of the potential for drug-associated adverse events such as emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction and loss of functional outcomes, as the expectation of these events may limit their impact on treatment discontinuation. Also, placebo effects remain frequent with treatment, and there is currently no agreed method for predicting response to therapy. Of the available methods to determine treatment response, pharmacogenetic testing has limited value while functional imaging may be valuable, but is not practical in routine clinical practice. Online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) represents a new option in the clinical management of patients with depression, particularly for patients who may not be able to access direct interaction with a psychotherapist because of the severity of their condition, their geographic location or socioeconomic situation. Online CBT can act as an adjunct to drug treatment and face-to-face psychotherapy, rather than as the sole form of treatment to aid in identifying a patient's needs, thus meeting the treatment gap and improving compliance and efficacy.Funding: Servier.","###Answer:

12,Depression,"Spreading depression (SD) is a wave of sustained depolarization challenging the energy metabolism of cells without causing irreversible damage. SD is a major mechanism of gene induction that takes place in cortical injury, including ischemia. We studied the role of oxygen radicals in SD-induced c-fos and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction using transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The frequency, amplitude and duration of SD waves were similar in the Tg mice and wild-type littermates. c-fos and COX-2 mRNAs were strongly induced 1 and 4 h after SD. The induction of both genes was slightly but significantly less at 4 h in the Tg mice. The results indicate that even a mild, noninjurious metabolic stimulation increases the concentration of oxygen radicals to the level that contributes to gene expression.","Young people have a higher prevalence of loneliness than other age groups, and they are also at risk of depression.

In contrast, Text B uses ""depression"" in the context of mental health, particularly focusing on psychological and emotional manifestations such as feelings of loneliness and their impacts. The usage in Text B aligns more broadly with the common understanding of depression as a psychiatric condition characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. The semantic drift here is significant as the word ""depression"" evolves from a specific physiological context to a broad psychological and emotional condition."

14,Depression,"Cerebellar Purkinje cells were studied by electrophysiological techniques in rats treated chronically with either desipramine (DMI) or lithium chloride given intragastrically. A striking decrement occurred in discharge frequencies of simple spikes and climbing fiber bursts in both groups of animals, similar to the depression produced by iontophoresis of these agents. Chronic treatment with DMI markedly decreased responsiveness to iontophoretically applied norepinephrine (NE), whereas long-term LiCl therapy slightly enhanced response to NE; responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid were unchanged by these treatments. The inhibitory responses to locus ceruleus stimulation were unaffected by chronic LiCl treatment. The effects of these chronic treatments on responsiveness to NE are opposite to the effects these same drugs produce when administered by acute iontophoresis to single cells: DMI then potentiates and LiCl antagonizes noradrenergic responses. These results provide electrophysiological evidence for reciprocal adaptive changes in NE sensitivity, supporting results of biochemical studies.","We investigated the physiological and behavioural strategies by which lactating Ethiopian Somali goats endure repeated periods of water deprivation. The experiment lasted for 32 days and was divided into four periods of 8 days each. Measurements were taken during the first 4 days in each period. Seven does (W1) were watered once daily and seven does (W4) were watered once every 4th day. Rectal temperature was taken at 0800 and 1715 h. Blood samples were taken in the evening and milk samples in the morning. The goats were on pasture between 0900 to 1215 h and 1315 to 1630 h with behaviour recorded every 5 min. The does were supplemented with 300 g of concentrates per head per day. Plasma and milk osmolality were determined by freezing point depression. Plasma total protein was measured on a TS refractometer. Plasma vasopressin concentrations were analysed by radio-immunoassay. The mean daily water intake of W1 was 1897 ml compared with the calculated mean of 1075 ml in W4 (P < 0.001). The mean diurnal variation of the rectal temperature was 3.5°C in both groups. Afternoon rectal temperature in W4 during period 1 was higher than that in the W1 on the days of water deprivation (P < 0.05). With repeated periods, plasma osmolality in W4 increased less over the days of water deprivation. It was 336, 321, 311 and 306 mosm/l on the 4th day at periods 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The corresponding vasopressin concentrations were 10.0, 9.2, 4.2 and 4.4 pmol/l. Total plasma protein concentration during period 1 on days 3 and 4 were higher in W4 than in W1 (P < 0.01). During the subsequent periods, it did not increase more in W4 compared with W1, but it was lower in W4 on the days after watering. W4 milk production decreased by 22% compared with W1 in all periods. With increasing days of water deprivation, the W4 goats spent less time in the sun, grazed shorter time and frequently ate cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) as compared with W1. Results suggested that dehydrated lactating Ethiopian Somali goats economised on water by diurnal variations of rectal temperature, storing water in the extracellular fluid, by changing behaviour at grazing and by decreasing milk production.","- Target word: Depression

15,Depression,"Estimates of the prevalence of depression among alcoholics vary widely, partly because of different methods used to define depression. To assess the specificity, sensitivity, change over time and agreement of several common methods, 52 men alcoholics were studied. Using DSM-III diagnosis by clinical interview as the standard, the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D) showed high sensitivity, high specificity and good agreement with DSM-III. The Beck Depression Inventory and the Depression Scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were not sensitive enough for screening purposes. Both self-report measures correlated more highly with the Ham-D and clinical interview than with each other. The dexamethasone suppression test had both low sensitivity and low specificity. All measures showed significant improvement over three weeks. More attention should be paid to using DSM-III criteria or the Ham-D instead of self-report scales in screening for depression among alcoholics.","To assess psychological symptoms in terms of depression, anxiety, and impact of an event associated with the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among nurses working in health sectors in Saudi Arabia and to investigate the relationship between the demographic variables of nurses and psychological symptoms.","- Label: Unchanged

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""depression"" is used within the context of discussing mental health conditions, specifically focusing on major depression (Text A) and depression and severity (Text B). In Text A, the focus is on the therapeutic aspects and the plasma concentration response relationship in treating major depression with fluoxetine. In Text B, research is aimed at understanding the relationship between physiological measures (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) and depression severity. Despite the differing methodologies—pharmacologic in Text A and physiological in Text B—the underlying context and concept of ""depression"" as a mental health disorder remain consistent across the two texts. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the usage of the word ""depression"" between these two periods."
17,Depression,"Orthodromically evoked field potentials were recorded in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices while perfusing the slices with media containing lead acetate. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) was applied to the stratum radiatum during lead perfusion. In half of the slices investigated, HFS resulted in an initial increase of the evoked responses which decayed again after about 10 min. In the other half the evoked responses increased only after the washout of lead and this potentiation was comparable to untreated controls. The lead-induced depression of the long-term potentiation might be related to the behavioral deficits observed in chronically lead-exposed mammals.","The structure of the velocity field induced by internal solitary waves of the first and second modes is determined. The contribution from second-order terms in asymptotic expansion into the horizontal velocity is estimated for the models of almost two- and three-layer fluid for solitons of positive and negative polarity. The influence of the nonlinear correction manifests itself firstly in the shape of the lines of zero horizontal velocity: they are curved and the shape depends on the soliton amplitude and polarity, while for the leading-order wave field they are horizontal. Also the wave field accounting for the nonlinear correction for mode I has smaller maximal absolute values of negative velocities (near-surface for the soliton of elevation, and near-bottom for the soliton of depression) and larger maximums of positive velocities. For solitary waves of negative polarity, which are the most typical for hydrological conditions in the ocean for low and middle latitudes, the situation is the opposite. The velocity field of the mode-II soliton in a smoothed two-layer fluid reaches its maximal absolute values in a middle layer instead of near-bottom and near-surface maximums for mode-I solitons.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The segment describes how high-frequency stimulation affected hippocampal slices in the presence of lead, noting a ""depression of the long-term potentiation,"" which pertains to a reduction or inhibition in the enhancement of signal transmission between neurons.
- Text B: The usage concerns ""the soliton of depression"" in an oceanographic context, describing the velocity field in different layers induced by solitary waves, with ""depression"" referring to a part of the wave or a low point within soliton movements in fluid dynamics.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The word ""depression"" has undergone a semantic drift as evidenced by its usage referring to different contexts and phenomena in the two texts. In Text A, it is used in a neurological context describing neuron activity, while in Text B, it is employed in oceanographic and fluid dynamics contexts referring to wave behavior. This represents a significant shift in usage and meaning of the term between the two period contexts, showing that the semantic content of ""depression"" has changed between these fields of study."
18,Depression,"The fatty acid composition of the plasma choline phosphoglycerides (CPG) and erythrocyte ethanolamine phosphoglycerides (EPG) were detemined in a series of patients suffering from endogenous depression, a number of patients from the same ward with non-depressive psychiatric disorders, and a number of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. A significantly higher proportion of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5omega3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6omega3), was found in the subjects with endogenous depression compared with the controls. This change was reflected to a lesser extent in the erythrocyte EPG. The proportions of the two prostaglandin precursors gamma-dihomolinolenic acid (20:3omega6) and arachidonic acid (20:4omega6) were similar in both groups. The fatty acid composition of the plasma CPG and erythrocyte EPG of a number of subjects from the same ward with non-depressive psychiatric disorders did not differ from that of the healthy controls. It is suggested that the analysis of the fatty acid composition of plasma CPG may be of diagnostic value and could be involved in the pathology of endogenous depression.",Depression and anxiety are prevalent symptoms in kidney transplant patients.

Text A discusses biochemical aspects and potential diagnostic markers associated with endogenous depression, focusing on biological changes and their diagnostic value for depression. Text B utilizes a clinical approach, discussing the prevalence and severity of depression symptoms among kidney transplant patients, and describes a study measuring these symptoms using a standardized inventory.

19,Depression,"It has previously been reported that unfamiliar face recognition memory is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD) [(Dewick, H. C., Hanley, J. R., Davies, A. D. M., Playfer, J. R. & Turnbull, C. J., Perception and memory for faces in Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychologia, 1991, 29, 785-802), (Haeske-Dewick, H. C., Are perception and memory for faces influenced by a specific age at onset factor in Parkinson's disease? Neuropsychologia, 1996, 34, 315-320), (Levin, B. E., Llabre, M. M. & Weiner, W. J., Cognitive impairments associated with early Parkinson's disease. Neurology, 1989, 39, 557-561)]. In the work reported here, we consider the possible mechanisms that might underlie this impairment. 28 PD patients and 28 controls were given a two-part test of recognition memory for words and faces, and two perceptual tests to measure their configural and componential processing ability. We found that PD patients were significantly worse than controls on the recognition memory test for faces, but not when the stimuli were words. In addition, PD patients were significantly impaired relative to controls on the closure test (FCT) used to measure configural processing, but there was no difference between the two groups on a test of componential processing ability. Multiple regression analyses revealed that even after accounting for the influence of age, intelligence and level of depression, configural processing ability was the important predictor of unfamiliar face recognition memory in Parkinson's disease. There was no effect of Parkinson's disease specific variables on either face recognition or FCT performance. In addition, some recently diagnosed patients were poor at face recognition. It is suggested that face configuration skills may be affected very early in the course of Parkinson's disease, and that this may be connected to the fact that considerable nigrostriatal degeneration and alteration in brain neurotransmitter levels occur before the clinical symptoms of PD appear.","COVID-19 took a heavy toll on older adults. In Belgium, by the end of August, 93% of deaths due to COVID-19 were aged 65 or older. Similar trends were observed in other countries. As a consequence, older adults were identified as a group at risk, and strict governmental restrictions were imposed on them. This has caused concerns about their mental health. Using an online survey, this study established the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults aged 65 years or older, and which factors moderate this impact. Participants reported a significant decrease in activity level, sleep quality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was strongly related to reported declines in activity level, sleep quality, wellbeing and cognitive functioning. Our study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the mental health of older adults. This implies that this group at risk requires attention of governments and healthcare.","- Target Word: Depression
- Text A: The usage of ""depression"" in Text A refers to a physiological decrease in activity, particularly in the context of respiratory function affected by carbachol injections in experimental settings with cats. Here, it is used exclusively in the biological and physical sciences context to describe reduced function or activity in body systems.
- Text B: In Text B, ""depression"" refers explicitly to a mental health condition characterized by a significant decrease in well-being, activity levels, and cognitive functioning, as observed in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is described as a psychological state affecting human emotions and behaviors, requiring attention from healthcare and governmental institutions.

20,Depression,"Clinical presentation and course were studies in 45 consecutive patients (p)--39 males, 6 females with angiographically proven left main coronary artery stenosis (LMCA) > 50%. Mean age was 54.7 years. Three (6%) had no history of chest pain, 2 p (4%) had atypical chest pain, and the remaining (90%) had typical angina pectoris. 19 p (42%) had unstable angina, 20 p (44%) had suffered a myocardial infarction in the past. Outside an episode of chest pain most of the patients had an abnormal ECG with ST-T segment depression 2 mm or more in leads V3-6 and ST-T elevation in leads V1 and aVR. No significant differences were found when the abnormalities of the ST-T segment were compared to severity of LMCA obstruction. A symptom limited exercise test was performed in 17 (37%) p. It was abnormal in 13 p (29%). Thirty eight patients (85%) underwent bypass surgery and the mean number of bypass graft was 3.3. Seven patients were treated medically. In the surgical group four p (10.5%) died perioperatively. All of them had subtotal occlusion of LMCA, without significant lesions in the remaining coronary arteries, the ejection fraction (EF) was above 66%. Among thirty four living patients thirty have been asymptomatic. In the medically treated group 3 p (42%) died and only two of four survivors were asymptomatic at a mean follow-up 35.7 months. Left ventricle of all died patients were severely damaged (EF mean 28%), right coronary artery (RCA) was totally occluded and all had rythm disturbances. We conclude, that patients with significant LMCA stenosis had a good prognosis when treated surgically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for epilepsy is a well established and effective treatment for medically intractable epilepsy. VNS is indicated if resective epilepsy surgery is unsuccessful or is not an option. About 50% of patients with VNS have a seizure reduction greater than 50%, but less than 10% become seizure-free. VNS also has an alerting effect on patients and may allow a reduction in sedating medications. The major adverse event is hoarseness, but treatment is generally well tolerated. The therapeutic effect can be delayed: patients may improve several months after VNS implantation. Direct brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging treatment for epilepsy. Scheduled stimulation is similar to brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Only the anterior thalamic nucleus has been studied in a larger randomized, controlled trial, in which patients with the stimulator turned on had a significantly reduced seizure frequency. Responsive stimulation applies an electrical stimulus at the site of seizure onset to terminate the seizure if one occurs. The seizure-onset zone must be well defined before implantation. Responsive stimulation requires seizure detection and application of a stimulus online. A large pivotal trial showed a significant reduction in seizure frequency. Both DBS and responsive neurostimulation are well tolerated, but there has been some concern about depression with DBS. Infection, hemorrhage, and lead breakage are adverse events possible with any type of stimulator. None of the brain stimulation devices have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but final approval is expected soon. These devices are indicated for patients with bilateral seizure onset or seizure onset in eloquent areas. Although the initial trials of brain stimulation do not show overwhelming improvement in seizure frequency, the technology will improve with time as we continue to learn about the use of brain stimulation for epilepsy. Optimization of VNS has been going on for 10 years, and we need to ensure that brain stimulation is similarly developed further. In addition, sophisticated devices such as responsive neurostimulators can greatly enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of epilepsy.","###Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Here, ""depression"" refers to a medical condition characterized by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, specifically showing ST-T segment depression. This term describes the physical depression or dip seen in the ECG waveforms often associated with cardiac issues.
- Text B: In this text, ""depression"" is used in the context of psychological effects that might occur as a potential side effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies. This represents the mental health aspect, specifically mood disorders characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities.

22,Depression,"This study examined whether faking depression can affect Rorschach variables associated with distress. Fifty-eight nondepressed undergraduates were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups of 29 subjects each. All subjects took the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) Depression Scale, Rorschach Inkblot Test, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) under standard administration procedures. Immediately before taking the Rorschach and BDI, experimental group subjects were: (a) instructed to fake depression, (b) provided with a clinical description of the disorder, and (c) offered a cash incentive for the most convincing test display of depression. These conditions increased scores on the BDI, p less than .0001, Morbid Special Score, p less than .05, Bl, p less than .005, and reduced R, p less than .05, but affected no determinants. Power to detect a clinically significant effect of faking on the sum of gray-black determinants was .99 (alpha = .05). Major implications are: (a) abnormal frequencies of determinants should not be attributed to malingering, and (b) Rorschach content measures of depression are affected by impression management strategies.","It has been clinically reported that patients with chronic pain often have accompanying cognitive deficiency, which hampers efficient medical treatment. In the present study, we investigated whether hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which has been considered to be a cellular model of learning and memory, could be influenced by chronic pain conditions using a murine model of neuropathic pain prepared by partial ligation of the sciatic nerve (the Seltzer model). In slices obtained from neuropathic animals, tetanus-induced long-term potentiation of CA1 hippocampal synaptic transmission was impaired, whereas long-term depression induced by low-frequency stimulation was similar in neuropathic and sham-treated (control) animals. Bath application of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol diminished the difference of synaptic plasticity between neuropathic and control mice. In the presence of isoproterenol, long-term potentiation was successfully induced in neuropathic mice. By contrast, long-term potentiation in sham-treated mice was impaired by propranolol which did not alter the already impaired long-term potentiation after peripheral nerve injury. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic functions are changed in chronic pain conditions, which may underlie the deficiency of long-term potentiation.","- Target word: Depression

- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""depression"" is used in contexts that align closely with its established psychological and physiological/medical connotations—related to mood and mental health in Text A, and a form of synaptic response in Text B. Text A's use of ""depression"" pertains to deliberately simulating the emotional condition, while Text B references a specific type of synaptic activity (long-term depression), which is commonly termed so in neuroscientific contexts. Despite varying usage across different scientific domains, the core conceptual aspect of 'depression' — whether as a psychological state or physiological process — remains strongly aligned and consistent. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the word's usage between the two texts."
23,Depression,"Locomotor stepping can be elicited by brain stimulation at various diencephalic sites under moderate levels of Nembutal. This study determined if locomotor initiation measured under anesthesia provides a valid measure of the intersite factors which determine initiation in the awake condition. We compared the latencies to initiate locomotor stepping elicited by electrical stimulation (50 microA, 0.5-msec pulses, 10 to 160 Hz) by rats tested while awake and unrestrained in a rotary runway or anesthetized and held in a stereotaxic apparatus. In the latter tests, initial anesthesia was provided by Nembutal (25 mg/kg) and 2% halothane and maintenance anesthesia was provided by 7 mg/kg as needed and local injections of lidocaine. For 30 sites in 16 rats, average locomotor initiation latency in the awake condition and the shortest latencies in the anesthetized condition were positively correlated (r = .78). Locomotion at sites with long latencies in the awake condition was frequently blocked in the anesthetized condition, but sites with short latencies were rarely blocked. The results indicate that the shortest locomotor latencies in the anesthetized condition approximate the latencies measured in the awake condition. It is concluded that the anesthetized condition can provide valid initiation measures, but sites with long latencies in the awake condition are prone to depression under anesthesia.","Children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) are at risk of developing cognitive difficulties. Although a diabetes onset of patient influences cognitive difficulties, synaptic properties related to the age of diabetes onset remain unknown. Here we showed that synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), and excitatory synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses in hippocampal slices were affected by age of onset in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZ-rats), compared with age-matched control rats. LTP was impaired and the ratio of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs relative to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated EPSCs (the AMPA/NMDA ratio) decreased in young adult-onset STZ-rats, whereas LTD was impaired and both AMPA receptor-mediated and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs increased in juvenile-onset STZ-rats. Furthermore, impaired LTD of juvenile-onset STZ-rats was restored with an NMDA receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the pathophysiology of diabetes-induced cognitive difficulties varies with the age of diabetes onset.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The term ""depression"" is used to describe a decrease or a reduction, specifically in how the ""locomotor stepping"" initiation and performance of rats are suppressed under anesthesia. Here, ""depression"" is more aligned with its general meaning associated with reduced function or activity.
- Text B: In this context, ""depression"" refers to a decrease in synaptic function or activity, described as ""long-term depression (LTD)"" at neural synapses. This usage of ""depression"" still adheres to the theme of decrease and diminished activity, but in a more specialized neuroscientific context.

24,Depression,"Chronic pain patients and brain injured patients frequently exhibit anxiety, depression, perseveration, and fixed ideation about their injuries. Both populations also frequently suffer from decreased attention, impaired concentration, easy fatigability, personality changes, impaired relationships with family and friends, and difficulty maintaining a job. In cases where chronic pain coexists with traumatic brain injury, the brain injury is often obscured. Risk factors which should alert the medical team to possible coexisting brain injury include history of loss of consciousness at original injury, history of trauma to the head, whiplash injury to the neck, multisystem trauma, and admission of memory or attention deficits by the patient. When any of these risk factors are present, we have found that formal examination of cognitive function is required to explore the potential of coexisting brain injury; if pain is a prominent clinical feature, residual cognitive sequelae of mild brain injury is easily masked. Specific testing of attention, new learning ability, constructional ability, and higher cognitive functions are most helpful in this population, and they need to be included in the mental status examination when concomitant brain injury is suspected. In our study, seven patients were found to have undiagnosed brain injury in a series of 67 consecutive patient referrals to our pain rehabilitation program. Treatment failure is high in this subgroup of pain patients unless treatment is directed toward the sequelae of both brain injury and chronic pain.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) with unknown etiology that occurs primarily in older adults with a median survival time of 2.5±3.5 years. Since there is no curative treatment for IPF, patients with IPF may have symptoms of depression and anxiety more than those of other interstitial lung diseases. There is a few studies about comparison of anxiety depression with other interstitial lung disease and IPF. In this study, we investigated whether anxiety depression in IPF was more frequent than other ILDs and its effect on quality of life.","- Target word: Depression

25,Depression,"A direct photon absorptiometry method was used to measure bone mineral content in a population of mentally retarded subjects, one half of whom were undergoing long-term anticonvulsant drug therapy. The sample consisted of 134 subjects, 60 males and 74 females. Average ages were 22.5 years for the females and 19.7 years for the males. A multiple regression analysis showed there was no apparent effect on anticonvulsant drug therapy on bone mineral content in this mentally retarded and growth retarded population. A comparison with normal standards indicates that bone mineral values for age for both sexes of mentally retarded subjects were depressed from 15-40 percent relative to white standards. The bone mineral depression closely paralleled the growth depression seen in this population. It is suggested that the inability to detect an overall anticonvulsive drug effect on bone mineral values may be due to the general growth retardation seen in this institutionalized mentally retarded population.","NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two prominent forms of synaptic plasticity, both of which are triggered by post-synaptic calcium elevation. To understand how calcium selectively stimulates two opposing processes, we developed a detailed computational model and performed simulations with different calcium input frequencies, amplitudes, and durations. We show that with a total amount of calcium ions kept constant, high frequencies of calcium pulses stimulate calmodulin more efficiently. Calcium input activates both calcineurin and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at all frequencies, but increased frequencies shift the relative activation from calcineurin to CaMKII. Irrespective of amplitude and duration of the inputs, the total amount of calcium ions injected adjusts the sensitivity of the system to calcium input frequencies. At a given frequency, the quantity of CaMKII activated is proportional to the total amount of calcium. Thus, an input of a small amount of calcium at high frequencies can induce the same activation of CaMKII as a larger amount, at lower frequencies. Finally, the extent of activation of CaMKII signals with high calcium frequency is further controlled by other factors, including the availability of calmodulin, and by the potency of phosphatase inhibitors.","- Target word: Depression

26,Depression,"It is difficult to treat a family, particularly when clinicians only have the opportunity to see one or two members in the medical setting. Still, one can accomplish a great deal by viewing the patient within a family system. Advantages of this systemic approach are similar to those accrued when one views the individual patient's problems as being inter-connected. For example, we know that pain stemming from MS can exacerbate depression that, in turn, increases pain ... and so on. By the same token, if the clinician treats either pain or depression, it will likely reduce the other one. One doesn't need to treat all aspects of the family to show a fundamental improvement in the system. If the well partner attends a support group, his or her ability to care for the patient may increase, which could reduce his or her own depression. If children learn to explain the patient's MS to their friends, then they feel more comfortable with closeness to the parent. Treating the family helps it stay healthy, and it is the family who ultimately cares for the patient. To treat the family is to provide the patient with essential care.","Stress and corticosteroids dynamically modulate the expression of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the developed brain. Together with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are critical mediators of synaptic function and are essential for the induction of many forms of synaptic plasticity. Regulation of NMDAR function by cortisol/corticosterone (CORT) may be fundamental to the effects of stress on synaptic plasticity. Recent reports of the efficacy of NMDAR antagonists in treating certain stress-associated psychopathologies further highlight the importance of understanding the regulation of NMDAR function by CORT. Knowledge of how corticosteroids regulate NMDAR function within the adult brain is relatively sparse, perhaps due to a common belief that NMDAR function is stable in the adult brain. We review recent results from our laboratory and others demonstrating dynamic regulation of NMDAR function by CORT in the adult brain. In addition, we consider the issue of how differences in the early life environment may program differential sensitivity to modulation of NMDAR function by CORT and how this may influence synaptic function during stress. Findings from these studies demonstrate that NMDAR function in the adult hippocampus remains sensitive to even brief exposures to CORT and that the capacity for modulation of NMDAR may be programmed, in part, by the early life environment. Modulation of NMDAR function may contribute to dynamic regulation of synaptic plasticity and adaptation in the face of stress, however, enhanced NMDAR function may be implicated in mechanisms of stress-related psychopathologies including depression.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: In this context, ""depression"" refers to a psychological or emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of energy or interest in life. The text explains how addressing physical pain in a patient can alleviate symptoms of depression and the interconnectedness of pain and depression in a patient's overall health. The focus here is on depression as a mental health condition affecting individuals and how it influentially interlinks with other aspects of health in a systemic family framework.
- Text B: This text uses ""depression"" to discuss stress-related psychopathologies including neurobiological aspects of depression.

- Reason: Despite the different contexts in which the term ""depression"" is used in both texts (i.e., one being more focused on family and systemic treatment and the other on neurobiological mechanisms and stress), the underlying concept remains centered on depression as a psychological disorder, characterized by emotional and mental disturbances. Both texts explore differing aspects and contributing factors to depression but inherently maintain a consistent reference to its nature as a mental health issue. Therefore, there is no significant shift in the meaning or connotation of the word ""depression"" between the two periods covered by the texts."
27,Depression,"Behavioral phenomena consisting of approach (self-stimulation, SS), flight and ambivalence (approach-flight) elicited by intracranial stimulation (ICS) along the neuraxis from the forebrain to the hindbrain were filmed and analyzed. The main findings were: (1) approach, flight and ambivalence could be obtained from all levels of the brain; (2) no single fixed behavioral pattern was common to approach or ambivalence; (3) there were instead different patterns which varied according to the area but some of the individual features of these patterns were at times common to several brain areas; (4) exploration with sniffing was found to be the most frequent behavior accompanying both approach and ambivalence. For SS, exploration was organized in the following topographical manner: nonsystematically at the level of the dorsal pons, diffused at the raphé, scattered at the level of the ventromedial mesencephalon (VMT), and focalized at the level of the lateral hypothalamus; (5) the highest intensities of SS, flight and ambivalence were found in the more caudal areas, namely the VMT for approach, the posterior mesencephalic reticular formation for ambivalence and the ventral region of the reticularis pontis caudalis (RPC) for flight; (6) in approach behavior for SS, when the point of stimulation was changed from the medio-frontal cortex to the posterior hypothalamus and VMT, an orderly change from depression to excitation of locomotor activity appeared. However, in the case of the locus coeruleus (LC) and adjacent dorsal tegmentum, SS by bursts was correlated with either intense motor activity or transitory periods of adynamia followed eventually by progressive ambivalence after bursts of SS; (7) approach and ambivalence elicited from areas known or believed to be involved in sleep regulation (midbrain raphé, LC and proximal dorsal pontine areas) were accompanied by what at first appeared as disruptive behaviors; but other complex behaviors were noted which suggest that during alertness, these areas may be involved in behaviors that are phylogenetically important for the development of motor and cognitive functions and most likely also in the behavioral manifestations of major psychiatric illnesses.","To determine whether coping strategies modify the risk of depression among allogeneic recipients experiencing post-transplant-related symptomatology, 105 participants (mean age = 52 years, 42% female) completed questionnaires 90 days post-transplant. A total of 28 percent reported depressive symptoms. Univariate correlations indicated that depression was associated with greater transplant-related symptomatology and avoidance, acceptance/resignation, and emotional discharge coping. Depression was negatively associated with problem-solving coping. Moderator analyses indicated that transplant-related symptomatology was significantly associated with depression among patients who frequently used maladaptive coping and rarely used adaptive coping. These data suggest that transplant-related symptomatology, combined with maladaptive coping, place patients at risk of depression.","### Answer

- Target word: Depression
- Text A: This text describes an experiment involving intracranial stimulation (ICS) in animals, noting behaviors such as approach, flight, and ambivalence, and observes the effects of this stimulation on various brain regions. The use of ""depression"" here describes a decrease or reduction in locomotor activity, particularly highlighting an effect within a physiological or neurological context.
- Text B: Here, ""depression"" refers to a psychological state characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection, commonly experienced among humans. It specifically addresses emotional and psychological aspects of depression in allogeneic transplant recipients, analyzing how symptoms of depression correlate with coping strategies and overall mental health.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: Between Text A and Text B, the term ""depression"" shows a significant semantic drift from describing a physiological reduction in activity (neurologic decrease) to a psychological state of mental health. In Text A, depression is an effect induced in a controlled experimental setting, primarily a physiological response, while in Text B, it refers to a mental health condition affecting mood and emotional well-being, a common understanding in contemporary contexts."
28,Depression,"Sensitivity of the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata to organophosphorus agents, oxime reactivators, and muscarinic antagonists was examined in order to delineate sites of cholinergic activity in the central nervous system. The exposed ventral surface of the medulla oblongata in anaesthetized cats was treated with the organophosphorus anticholinesterase agents soman and (7-nitro-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) aminopentyl methylphosphonofluoridate (NBD-AP-MFP), a fluorescent active centre-selective probe of acetylcholinesterase. Topical application of soman (1-5 micrograms) or NBD-AP-MPF (5-120 micrograms) elicited a profound (80-90 mm Hg), long-lasting (0.5-3 h), dose-dependent vasodepression with only minor changes in heart rate and respiration. The vasodepression was rapidly reversed (7-10 min) upon topical application of muscarinic antagonists (atropine methylnitrate, atropine sulphate) and the bisquaternary oxime HI-6; systemic administration was without effect. Reversal of the hypotension by HI-6 occurred irrespective of whether the organophosphorus agent was NBD-AP-MPF, which forms conjugates with acetylcholinesterase that undergo no aging, or soman, which forms conjugates that undergo extensive aging rendering the enzyme refractory to oxime reactivation. Hence, oxime efficacy for reversal of the physiologic hypotension was not dependent solely on the fraction reactivatable enzyme. By virtue of the fluorescence distribution of NBD-AP-MPF the chemosensitive sites were estimated to reside no deeper than 50 microns into the medulla oblongata, providing a direct indication for localization of the chemosensitive cells on the superficial surface.","Depression occurs in an interpersonal dynamic and living with a depressed person can lead to a significant burden on the partner. Instruments measuring burden do not address couples and often measure caregiving for individuals with schizophrenic disorders. The partner burden in depression (PBD) questionnaire is a new instrument measuring PBD by asking individuals, (1) which symptoms they can observe in their depressed partners and (2) to which degree this burdens them. Hence, PBD combines measuring the awareness of observed depressive symptoms and the resulting burden. Additionally, it addresses aspects unique to couple relationships. Our German validation confirmed a one-factor model with 12 items. The PBD had good psychometric properties and was sensitive to change. Partner burden predicted self-reported depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) over time. PBD is short, easily applicable in research and practice and can add to the understanding of partner effects in depression.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""depression"" is used in a physiological context, specifically referring to a reduction in blood pressure (""vasodepression""). This medical term does not relate to mental or emotional states, but solely to a physical health condition characterized by a drop in blood pressure. In Text B, however, ""depression"" clearly refers to the psychological state or mental health condition characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection. This demonstrates a significant shift in the use of the word from a physiological to a psychological context between the two texts."
29,Depression,"The effects of enflurane anaesthesia on central circulation, total oxygen uptake, splanchnic circulation and splanchnic oxygen uptake were studied in 10 artifically ventilated dogs, basally anaesthetized with thiopental and nitrous oxide. Hepatic arterial, superior mesenteric arterial and portal venous blood flows were measured with electromagnetic flowmetry. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. Determinations of oxygen contents were made in arterial, pulmonary arterial, portal venous and hepatic venous blood. The end-tidal enflurane concentration was kept at about 1 MAC (= 2.2%). Arterial blood pressure diminished 54% of control value due to decreases of cardiac output to 65% and of total peripheral vascular resistance to 81% of control values. Hepatic arterial, superior mesenteric arterial and portal venous blood flows decreased to 65-70% of control levels and the corresponding vascular resistances all declined to about 80-85% of control values. Total oxygen uptake decreased, but less than cardiac output, leading to an increased arterio-venous oxygen content difference. Oxygen uptake of the preportal tissues was unchanged and hepatic oxygen uptake was not significantly altered, although there were decreases in hepatic oxygen uptake in some of the individual experiments. It is suggested that the cardiovascular depression following enflurane anaesthesia in the dog was due, to a great extent, to a primary myocardial depression. It is further concluded that the splanchnic blood flows were relatively well preserved, due to decreases in splanchnic vascular resistances, and that hepatic and preportal tissue oxygen consumptions were maintained by increased oxygen extraction.","A large amount of research has been conducted on the effects of sex hormones on gender differences in patients with depression, yet research on cognitive differences between male and female patients with depression is insufficient. This study uses emotion pictures to investigate the differences of the emotional working memory ability and emotional experience in male and female patients with depression. Despite identifying that the working memory of patients with depression is impaired, our study found no significant gender differences in emotional working memory. Moreover, the research results revealed that memory effects of mood congruence are produced in both men and women, which may explain why the depression state can be maintained. Furthermore, female patients have more emotional experiences than male patients, which is particularly significant in terms of negative emotional experiences. This result provides cognitive evidence to explain why women suffer from longer terms of depression, are more susceptible to relapse, and can more easily suffer from major depressive disorder in the future.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term 'depression' refers to a physiological reduction or decrease, specifically talking about the effects of anesthesia leading to lowered blood pressures and reduced cardiac outputs, representing a general suppression of physiological activity (""cardiovascular depression""). In Text B, 'depression' is used in the psychological context, referring to the mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, impaired cognitive functions such as memory, and differential emotional experiences in genders. This represents a significant shift in meaning from a physiological state to a mental health condition."
30,Depression,"Massive changes in suicide rates over time have been recognized in the United States. An attempt has been made to describe these changes with age-period-cohort analyses. A variety of approaches has led us to conclude that suicide rates of non-white males, white and non-white females can be described adequately without a cohort effect. Recent suicide trends lead to the conclusion that a model based on a rising rate in more recently born white male cohorts coupled with an independent age effect could be rejected. If a cohort effect is postulated for more recent birth cohorts, it would require that the cohort suicide rate is decreasing with each successive birth cohort. Models based on high suicide rates in recent cohorts and additive age effects are probably misleading for future predictions. An association was noted between recent changes in the teenage and young adult suicide rates and rates of depression. Both may be the product of similar social influences.","Dysmenorrhea and noncyclic pelvic pain (chronic pelvic pain) are common in adolescents. The evaluation of teens with dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain is aimed to diagnose possible gynecologic conditions (endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts, and obstruction of the reproductive tract) and nongynecologic conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and myofascial pain). The management of chronic pelvic pain in adolescents is often more complex than in adult women because both the adolescent and her parents are counseled and addressed, and her long-term emotional and physical health, fertility, and sexuality are considered. Dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain are often associated with depression and anxiety in adolescents. Thus, psychosocial counseling plays an important role in the management of these patients. This review will present a systematic approach to the evaluation and treatment of dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain in adolescents.","- **Target word**: Depression
- **Text A**: The mention of ""depression"" here refers to a ""depression of the respiratory motor output,"" indicating a reduction or suppression of physiological activity related to breathing mechanisms in a scientific research context. The word is used to describe the physical effect induced by carbachol in an experimental setup with cats.
- **Text B**: In this text, ""depression"" is used in the context of mental health, particularly linking it to adverse psychological conditions such as anxiety, as experienced by adolescents with chronic pelvic pain. It pertains to emotional and psychological affectations.

- **Label**: Changed
- **Reason**: Between Text A and Text B, the usage of ""depression"" shifts significantly from a physiological context focusing on the reduction of organ function to a psychological context signifying a mental health condition. This indicates a notable semantic drift in the application of the term across different domains, from clinical/biological effects to a broader, mental health discussion."
31,Depression,"A standardized technique of general anaesthesia, with one randomly selected variable, was provided for 237 patients undergoing elective and 540 undergoing emergency Caesarean section. The variable was the volatile agent used to maintain anaesthesia, the choice resting between trichloroethylene (0.2 or 0.3 vol.%) and halothane (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 vol.%). No association was found between the type of agent and the duration of anaesthesia, or the duration of either the I-D or the U-D interval. A smaller total dose of suxamethonium was administered in conjunction with the higher concentrations of volatile agent. A statistically significant but clinically unimportant increase in the time elapsing from the cessation of anaesthesia to maternal achievement of a ""safe level of consciousness"" was found with the higher concentrations. The incidence of maternal awareness plus unpleasant dreams was unacceptably high when the lower concentrations were used, and it is recommended that either trichloroethylene 0.3 vol.% or halothane 0.4 or 0.5 vol.% be used. Neither agent, at these concentrations, was associated with neonatal depression in group A elective sections in which the fetus presented by the vertex, and although there was a possible tendency for their use in cases of fetal compromise to be associated with an increase in the incidence of neonatal respiratory depression, the degree of depression was of little consequence to neonatal well-being. It was confirmed that breech presentation and prolongation of the U-D interval are important determinants of depression and birth asphyxia among infants delivered by Caesarean section under general anaesthesia.","The emotional bond that a mother feels towards her baby is critical to social, emotional and cognitive development. Maternal health and wellbeing through pregnancy and antenatal bonding also play a key role in determining bonding postnatally, but the extent to which these relationships may be disrupted by poor mental health or substance use is unclear. This study aimed to examine the extent to which mother-fetal bonding, substance use and mental health through pregnancy predicted postnatal mother-infant bonding at 8 weeks. Participants were 372 women recruited from three metropolitan hospitals in Australia. Data was collected during trimesters one, two and three of pregnancy and 8 weeks postnatal using the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS), Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS), the Edinburgh Antenatal and Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Depression and Anxiety Scales (DASS-21), frequency and quantity of substance use (caffeine, alcohol and tobacco) as well as a range of demographic and postnatal information. Higher antenatal bonding predicted higher postnatal bonding at all pregnancy time-points in a fully adjusted regression model. Maternal depressive symptoms in trimesters two and three and stress in trimester two were inversely related to poorer mother-infant bonding 8 weeks postnatally. This study extends previous work on the mother's felt bond to her developing child by drawing on a large sample of women and documenting the pattern of this bond at three time points in pregnancy and at 8 weeks postnatally. Utilising multiple antenatal waves allowed precision in isolating the relationships in pregnancy and at key intervention points. Investigating methods to enhance bonding and intervene in pregnancy is needed. It is also important to assess maternal mental health through pregnancy.","### Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: In Text A, ""depression"" is used primarily in a physiological context, referring specifically to the depression of respiratory function caused by anesthesia during Caesarean sections. The meaning here is related to a decrease or reduction in a physiological function.
- Text B: In Text B, ""depression"" is used in a psychological context, indicating a mental health condition characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection. The focus is on maternal depressive symptoms and their impact on mother-infant bonding.
- Label: **Changed**
- Reason: The term ""depression"" has undergone semantic drift from a physiological reduction in Text A (concerning neonatal respiratory depression and anesthesia) to a mental health condition in Text B (related to postnatal maternal depression). This shows a shift in the domain from medical-physiological to psychological-emotional, indicating a significant change in contextual usage and meaning."
32,Depression,"The inability to perform essential activities of daily living such as cooking, shopping, dressing and bathing is termed functional disability. These deficits can prevent elders from enjoying independent, active lifestyles. The development of functional disability is a gradual process. Early identification and intervention by the primary care physician can often reduce functional decline. Screening for functional decline has traditionally been performed by either questionnaire or direct observation of tasks. This paper reviews methods which have been proposed to integrate functional disability screening into office practice. A method which incorporates both questionnaire and direct observation is recommended by the authors. The method of screening proposed targets specific areas prone to dysfunction. It focuses on simple screens of vision, hearing, arm and leg function, urinary incontinence, mental status, depression, nutrition, activities of daily living, environmental hazards, and social support systems. Appropriate methods of follow up evaluation and treatment are provided. This fifteen minute technique is a practical and applicable means of screening elderly patients for functional deficits in the primary care office.","Among vertebrates able to tolerate periods of oxygen deprivation, the painted and red-eared slider turtles (Chrysemys picta and Trachemys scripta) and the crucian carp (Carassius carassius) are the most extreme and can survive even months of total lack of oxygen during winter. The key to hypoxia survival resides in concerted physiological responses, including strong metabolic depression, protection against oxidative damage and-in air-breathing animals-redistribution of blood flow. Each of these responses is known to be tightly regulated by nitric oxide (NO) and during hypoxia by its metabolite nitrite. The aim of this review is to highlight recent work illustrating the widespread roles of NO and nitrite in the tolerance to extreme oxygen deprivation, in particular in the red-eared slider turtle and crucian carp, but also in diving marine mammals. The emerging picture underscores the importance of NO and nitrite signaling in the adaptive response to hypoxia in vertebrate animals. ","###Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The text discusses the concept of ""depression"" in the context of diminished capabilities leading to functional disability among elderly patients. This usage focuses on reduced functioning and abilities, often linked to mental health issues.
- Text B: Here, ""depression"" is used in the biological sense, referring to ""metabolic depression"" among certain aquatic and amphibian species during low oxygen conditions. The context is entirely physiological, describing a reduction in metabolic activity to conserve energy during hypoxia.
- Label: Changed
- Reason: There is a fundamental shift in the application and context of the word ""depression"" from Text A to Text B. In Text A, ""depression"" refers to mental or functional health deterioration, while in Text B, it signifies a physiological adaptation for survival in low-oxygen environments. This indicates a significant semantic drift in the interpretation and use of the word."

36,Depression,"The present study explored age differences in the expression of depression. Such differences were quite apparent. Among 118 young adults and 107 community-residing elderly individuals, it was found that in the young adult groups, cognitive belief factors labeled ""externality/control"" and ""dependency/emotionality"" were associated with both affective and cognitive aspects of depression, but not somatic depressive symptoms over and above the influence of sociodemographic factors. In contrast, among older adults, a cognitive belief factor labeled ""cognitive-emotional rigidity/dependency"" was uniquely associated with both affective and somatic depressive symptoms. Additionally, a second cognitive factor, labeled ""adaptation/internal control"" defined in terms of the absence of irrational thinking about adaptation and control, was negatively related to somatic depressive symptoms. For each sample, poorer health was associated with greater depressive symptomatology.

37,Depression,"We evaluated the possible role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the calcium(Ca++)-mediated damage of skeletal muscle by a calcium ionophore (A23187) that induces excessive Ca++ influx.

A23187-induced depression was reduced by PG synthesis inhibitors, aspirin, or indomethacin, though less than that by a protease inhibitor, leupeptin. PGE2-induced depression was also inhibited by leupeptin. Damage of the muscle cell by excessive intracellular free Ca++ may thus be mediated via a PGE2 pathway besides other mechanisms including non-lysosomal, Ca++-activated proteases.","Olfactory loss impacts around 20% of the population and is associated with the reduction of pleasure from eating and drinking, sex and depression (1).

38,Depression,"This study was designed to examine the effects of a healer seeing chronically ill patients in a large semirural practice. The 57 patients were allocated alternately either to receive ten weekly healing sessions or to become waiting-list controls. Two weeks after completion of 'healing' 22 (81%) of the 27 study patients thought their symptoms had improved and 15 of these thought they had improved substantially. Study patients scored better than controls on both measures of symptoms (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), on anxiety and depression ratings (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and on general function measured by the Nottingham Health Profile (P < 0.01). Treatment differences were still evident three months later for one of the measures of symptom change (P < 0.05) and for both anxiety and depression ratings (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The percentages of natural killer cells (CD16, CD56) did not change greatly in either group. These results suggest that healing may be an effective adjunct for the treatment of chronically ill patients presenting in general practice. They do not distinguish between any specific effects of spiritual healing and non-specific effects such as relaxation; for further investigation, randomized controlled trials will be needed.","Chronic cannabis use has been shown to block long-term depression of GABA-glutamate synapses in the striatum, which is likely to reduce the extent to which endogenous cannabinoids modulate GABA- and glutamate-related neuronal activity.

The decrease in the ischaemic ST-segment depression on the level of maximal workload of the base line test was significant for both groups for all measures (Molsidomin from 0.27 to 0.08 mV; ISDN from 0.28 to 0.07 mV). The decrease of the ST-segment depression on the individual maximal workload level was significant for all measures in the Molsidomin group, but only on the first day of treatment in the ISDN group.","This review of current literature discusses the morphology of the volar aspect of the distal radius; the surgical procedure, arthroscopic findings, and clinical results of a plate presetting and arthroscopic reduction technique for acute intra-articular fractures; and a novel simulation guidance system for malunited intra-articular fractures. Classification of intra-articular distal radius fractures is also discussed, focusing on central depression fracture fragments, associated soft tissue injuries, and results for measuring scapholunate distances at different sites. Problems of the distal radioulnar joint are reviewed, in particular, functional outcomes of the authors' prospective cohort study on unstable intra-articular fractures involving the distal radioulnar joint.","- Target word: Depression

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""depression"" refers specifically to a decrease in the ST-segment as observed in ECG readings, commonly associated with ischemic changes of the heart muscle during stress. This is primarily a cardiological context. In Text B, ""depression"" is used in a completely different context, referring to a type of fracture described as ""central depression"" in the anatomy of bones, specifically in cases of intra-articular distal radius fractures. The word thus represents different meanings in two unrelated fields (cardiology vs. orthopedics), signifying a significant semantic drift from physiological symptoms to anatomical descriptor."
40,Depression,"Data from two fixed-dose studies of sertraline in panic disorder were pooled in order to provide sufficient power for the analysis of treatment response in clinically relevant subgroups. Male and non-fertile female patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for moderate-to-severe panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a 1-2 week placebo run-in period, and then were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either placebo, or one of three fixed daily doses of sertraline (50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg). Eighty-two patients were treated with placebo and 240 patients were treated with one of three doses of sertraline. All three sertraline doses produced significant efficacy compared to placebo, with no consistent evidence of a dose-response effect. For the subset of patients with subsyndromic depression at baseline [baseline Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D > 12 and < or = 21], sertraline yielded a significantly higher panic-free rate than did placebo (P = 0.021), again, by a conservative endpoint (Last Observation Carried Forward method, LOCF) analysis. Sertraline was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no significant between-dose differences in patients discontinuing due to adverse events. The presence of mild-to-moderate subsyndromic levels of depression did not reduce the anti-panic efficacy of sertraline.","Pharmacological treatment of any maternal illness during pregnancy warrants consideration of the consequences of the illness and/or medication for both the mother and unborn child. In the case of major depressive disorder, which affects up to 10-20% of pregnant women, the deleterious effects of untreated depression on the offspring can be profound and long lasting. Progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanism(s) of action of antidepressants, fetal exposure to these medications, and serotonin's role in development. New technologies and careful study designs have enabled the accurate sampling of maternal serum, breast milk, umbilical cord serum, and infant serum psychotropic medication concentrations to characterize the magnitude of placental transfer and exposure through human breast milk. Despite this progress, the extant clinical literature is largely composed of case series, population-based patient registry data that are reliant on nonobjective means and retrospective recall to determine both medication and maternal depression exposure, and limited inclusion of suitable control groups for maternal depression. Conclusions drawn from such studies often fail to incorporate embryology/neurotransmitter ontogeny, appropriate gestational windows, or a critical discussion of statistically versus clinically significant. Similarly, preclinical studies have predominantly relied on dosing models, leading to exposures that may not be clinically relevant. The elucidation of a defined teratological effect or mechanism, if any, has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. The extant literature indicates that, in many cases, the benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy for a depressed pregnant woman may outweigh potential risks. ","- Target word: Depression

41,Depression,"A study aimed at the standardization of symptom evaluation of patients with depression was carried out as the first step in an extensive collaborative study on affective disorders between centers in Nagasaki, Shanghai and Seoul. This study was initiated in order to clarify the factors affecting the low reported prevalence rates of depressive disorders in Asia. No significant difference in evaluation of psychiatric symptoms was observed between the 3 centers. Nevertheless, the diagnoses given by ICD-9 showed very interesting differences. For any given case, Nagasaki tended to make a diagnosis of an affective psychosis depression, while Shanghai made a diagnosis of neurotic disorder. No significant tendency was observed in the Seoul center. These findings are discussed in terms of their importance for future international collaborative studies.","We performed a comparative study of the effect of electroconvulsive therapy on anxiety in outbred rats and Sprague-Dawley rats with depressive-like disorder induced by exposure to ultrasound of variable frequency (20-45 Hz). The anxiogenic effect of therapy was revealed in elevated plus maze and open-field tests in both linear and non-lineal rats, but was more pronounced in linear animals. Differences between outbred rats and Sprague-Dawley rats by the anxiety level were demonstrated. These results suggest that electroconvulsive therapy should be used with cautious in patients with depression and comorbid anxiety disorders. Pronounced behavioral differences between linear and non-linear rats should be considered when choosing optimal experimental object in this research field.","###Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Describes an international collaborative study focused on the evaluation and diagnosis of depression in diverse cultural contexts in Asia. The primary focus is on how depression is diagnosed and perceived differently in Nagasaki, Shanghai, and Seoul, highlighting cross-cultural variations in the understanding and reporting of depressive disorders.
- Text B: Discusses a study about the effects of electroconvulsive therapy on rats with induced depressive-like disorders, examining not only the therapeutic effects but also highlighting the anxiety-inducing aspects of the treatment in different strains of rats. The context is more focused on experimental research on depression's treatment effects and associated anxiety in animals.

- Label: **Unchanged**
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term 'depression' is used to refer to a mental health condition characterized by mood disorders. Although the contexts differ — with Text A exploring diagnostic perceptions in humans across different cultural settings and Text B examining treatment effects in an animal model — the fundamental concept of ""depression"" as a mental health disorder remains consistent between the texts. The additional focus on anxiety or diagnostic cultural differences does not alter the underlying meaning of 'depression' as a psychiatric condition. Thus, the semantic drift of the term 'depression' is unchanged across the texts, as it consistently refers to the same core concept of a depressive disorder."
42,Depression,"Spinal cord injury is a common occurrence in Zimbabwe and carries with it a high morbidity and mortality. In the past almost all patients discharged from hospital were dead within a year. Reasons for this high mortality are presented. The establishment of the National Rehabilitation Centre has had a profound impact on the survival of these individuals as well as on improving their quality of life. The results of a retrospective survey on the mortality and life situation of individuals with spinal cord injuries sustained through trauma are presented. However major unresolved problems are inadequate housing, lack of financial support, practically no prospect of employment and depression compounded by boredom.","The beneficial effects of exercise have been well recognized for over half a century. Dr Jeremy Morris's pioneering studies in the fifties showed a striking difference in cardiovascular disease between the drivers and conductors on the double-decker buses in London. These studies sparked off a vast amount of research on the effects of exercise in health, and the general consensus is that exercise contributes to improved outcomes and treatment for several diseases including osteoporosis, diabetes, depression and atherosclerosis. Evidence of the beneficial effects of exercise is reviewed here. One way of highlighting the impact of exercise on disease is to consider it from the perspective of good practice. However, the intensity, duration, frequency (dosage) and counter indications of the exercise should be taken into consideration to individually tailor the exercise programme. An important case of the beneficial effect of exercise is that of ageing. Ageing is characterized by a loss of homeostatic mechanisms, on many occasions leading to the development of frailty, and hence frailty is one of the major geriatric syndromes and exercise is very useful to mitigate, or at least delay, it. Since exercise is so effective in reducing frailty, we would like to propose that exercise be considered as a supplement to other treatments. People all over the world have been taking nutritional supplements in the hopes of improving their health. We would like to think of exercise as a physiological supplement not only for treating diseases, but also for improving healthy ageing. ","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: In this context, ""depression"" refers to emotional distress, experiencing feelings such as sadness and hopelessness, particularly influenced by the socio-economic challenges faced by individuals with spinal cord injuries.
- Text B: Here, ""depression"" is discussed as a medical condition, specifically a mood disorder, which can be potentially treated or alleviated through exercise alongside other benefits related to physical health.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: Between the two texts, the usage of ""depression"" has undergone a semantic shift. In Text A, it relates to a general feeling of low mood arising from environmental and personal factors, somewhat casually used. Text B, on the other hand, treats ""depression"" specifically as a clinical condition, focusing on therapeutic measures and its inclusion in medical discourse about treatable conditions through interventions like exercise. This shift from an emotional state to a medically defined condition suggests a significant change in how the term is contextualized and understood."
43,Depression,"Patients with depression, particularly those seen by primary care physicians, may report somatic symptoms, such as headache, constipation, weakness, or back pain. Some previous studies have suggested that patients in non-Western countries are more likely to report somatic symptoms than are patients in Western countries. We used data from the World Health Organization's study of psychological problems in general health care to examine the relation between somatic symptoms and depression. The study, conducted in 1991 and 1992, screened 25,916 patients at 15 primary care centers in 14 countries on 5 continents. Of the patients in the original sample, 5447 underwent a structured assessment of depressive and somatoform disorders.","Suicidality is a major public health concern, particularly for low-income, trauma-exposed patients with limited access to mental health providers. However, limited research has modeled pathways of suicidality in safety-net primary care samples. Patients (N = 207) in a safety-net primary care clinic completed measures of childhood and adult trauma exposure, depression, and suicidality. Participants (M age = 44.8 years, SD = 11.6), were 60.4% male, 63.8% Black/African American, and predominantly low-income (i.e., 69.1% reported an annual income less than $5,000 USD). Half of the sample reported at least four childhood traumatic events (M = 3.9 events, SD = 3.0) and approximately three adult traumatic events (M = 3.0 events, SD = 2.1). Most participants (82.1%) reported significant depressive symptoms, and 43.5% endorsed recent suicidality. Models showing the mediational effect of depression on the association between trauma exposure and suicidality, β = .20, B = 0.23, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.16, 0.32], and the moderational effect of trauma exposure on the association between depression and suicidality, β = .16, B = 0.20, SE = 0.08, p = .007, were both supported. These results underscore the high prevalence of trauma exposure, depression, and suicidality in a safety-net primary care sample. They also highlight the pervasiveness and complexity of suicidality in low-income primary care patients, emphasize the importance of trauma-informed suicide assessment, and identify trauma sequelae and depression as potential treatment targets to reduce suicidality.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the target word ""depression"" refers to the psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms like significant depressive moods, sadness, and in some scenarios, somatic manifestations like pain or fatigue. Text A discusses the relationship between somatic symptoms and depression in a worldwide sample, while Text B digs into the interplay among trauma, depression, and suicidality in a specific patient group. In both texts, depression retains its primary meaning as a mental health disorder, and its clinical implications and associations with other health concerns remain central, even though the specific details and contexts vary (e.g., the link between somatic symptoms or trauma exposure and depressive states). Hence, the meaning of ""depression"" as a medical/psychological condition remains consistent between the two periods, indicating unchanged semantic drift."
44,Depression,"Performance on the Stroop Color-Word Test is impaired in depression, but it is not clear whether this impairment reflects a distractor inhibition disturbance or a reduction of processing resources. In this study, untreated major depressives were evaluated using a modified computerized Stroop Test composed of three tasks: to name the color of XXXXXs, of nonconflicting words, and of conflicting color words. It was hypothesized that, unlike color words, nonconflicting word distractors would disturb the color naming task only in the presence of a primary distractor inhibition disturbance. The slow reaction time (RT) depressives and normal RT depressives, according to their color naming speed without distractors, were contrasted to distinguish depressives with and without clear signs of resource deficit. It was found that interference produced by nonconflicting words was greater in normal RT depressives than in either slow RT depressives or control subjects, while interference caused by color words was dramatically stronger in slow RT depressives than in other groups. Results suggest the existence of two different attentional deficit patterns in clinical depression: some depressives have a distractor inhibition disturbance while others are deficient in processing resources.","Ketamine has traditionally been used as a dissociative anesthetic agent and more recently as a treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, there is growing concern over the increased use of ketamine in recreational and therapeutic settings due to the potential neurotoxic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that ketamine is cytotoxic in several cell types, such as fibroblasts, hepatocytes, uroepithelial cells, and adult induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Ketamine has been shown to dysregulate calcium signalling, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and impair mitochondrial function, ultimately leading to apoptosis. However, it is unclear whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a role in ketamine associated neurotoxicity in striatal neurons. Disruption to ER homeostasis can initiate ER-mediated cell death, which has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether ketamine's neurotoxic effects involve an ER stress-dependent pathway and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in its neurotoxic effects. Mouse striatal cells were treated with various concentrations of ketamine (10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM) or DMEM for 9-72 hrs. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, and changes in gene expression of ER stress markers were evaluated using RT-qPCR. MTT results revealed that 1 mM ketamine decreased cell viability in striatal cells after 24 h of treatment. Gene expression studies complemented these findings such that ketamine upregulated pro-apoptotic ER stress markers, including X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and downregulated pro-survival ER stress proteins such as GRP78, MANF and CDNF. Ketamine activated all three stress sensing pathways including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. Taken together, our results show that ketamine-induced neurotoxicity is mediated through an ER stress-dependent apoptotic pathway.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""depression"" retains its primary medical or psychological context—focusing on conditions characterized by a significant reduction of functioning either in a psychophysiological or mental health capacity. In Text A, ""depression"" is discussed in the frame of a psychophysiological effect on breathing patterns during specific neurochemical interventions in animal models. In Text B, it is mentioned in the context of the psychiatric condition, specifically major depressive disorder and its treatment options using medications like ketamine. Despite the difference in the detailed applications (respiratory depression in animals vs. mental depression in humans), the underlying theme remains a state or condition marked by reduction or impairment, keeping the semantic essence of ""depression"" consistent over time."
45,Depression,"The effect that chronic subcutaneous infusion of alpha- and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic agonists on plasma and atrial ANF was investigated. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, and carbachol, a cholinergic agonist produced a 3-fold increase in plasma ANF levels which were constant until the end of the infusion period. An increased natriuresis was observed in the same groups which was positively correlated with plasma ANF. No differences were observed in atrial content of ANF between the experimental groups. A sharp post-surgery decline in plasma ANF was observed in control, phenylephrine and epinephrine-treated groups which was maintained during the observation period of five days. This suggests that the rise in plasma ANF induced by isoproterenol and carbachol may be secondary to hemodynamic changes and not to direct receptor stimulation, and may play a role in the observed natriuresis. It is also suggested that the depression of plasma ANF may contribute to the well known post-surgery sodium retention.","This article is written in remembrance of Karl Valentin's 70th anniversary of his death.

He has been the most famous Bavarian comedian during world war II and during the early days of the Republic of Germany.","### Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The ""depression"" mentioned here relates to a reduced physiological or biological activity, specifically describing a ""depression of plasma ANF"" which implies a decrease in the levels of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma due to various physiological interactions.
- Text B: Here, ""depression"" refers to a mental health condition impacting a person's mood and overall psychological well-being, highlighted in the narrative of Karl Valentin's lifelong suffering from vegetative dystonia and depression.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The term ""depression"" has clearly diverged in context between the two texts. In Text A, it is used to describe a physical decrease in a specific biological function, whereas in Text B, it explicitly refers to a psychological disorder characterized by mood disturbances. This indicates a semantic drift from a general decrease in function or activity to a specific mental health context."
46,Depression,"A 2-stage strategy, combining an assessment of severity with depression criteria, can help a physician focus on the most severe cases without missing less severe ones that still need treatment. Because of its brevity, relatively high positive predictive value, and ability to inform the clinician on both depression severity and diagnostic criteria, the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is the best available depression screening tool for primary care. One-time screening is cost-effective; physicians may elect to screen more often based on risk factors.","Depression is a significant health problem gaining increasing relevance, especially among children and adolescents. It is known that the incidence of depression is higher in patients suffering from chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review aims to discuss the prevalence of depression in children and adolescents with CKD and its impact on the quality of life of these patients (HRQoL). The research was conducted using online databases with keywords: depression in children and adolescents, depression and chronic diseases, chronic kidney disease, and health-related quality of life. It was found that the risk for developing depression is higher for adolescents and females, and with the use of negative coping strategies, lack of caregiver nurturance, and poor socioeconomic status. In patients with pediatric CKD, the stage of the disease, age of CKD diagnosis, and type of treatment were found to significantly impact HRQoL and contribute to caregiver burden. Depression was more commonly found in children suffering from CKD. It causes significant mental distress to the child and contributes to the caregiver's burden. Screening for depression among CKD patients is advised. In depressed patients, transdiagnostic tools should be used to alleviate some of the symptoms. In children at risk of developing depression, preventative strategies should be considered.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both Text A and Text B describe “depression” in its psychological sense, referring specifically to the mental health condition characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection. In Text A, depression is discussed in the context of identifying and managing the condition using a screening tool, while Text B discusses the prevalence and impact of depression in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease. Despite the different contexts in which depression is discussed, the fundamental meaning of the word as a mental health condition remains consistent between the two texts. Therefore, the semantic usage of the word ""depression"" has not changed significantly between the periods the texts are from."
47,Depression,"Patients requiring aortography frequently suffer from generalized arteriosclerosis. Uncontrolled hypotension is therefore clearly undesirable, especially if associated with myocardial depression. Significant hypotension was observed following the use of conventional ionic contrast media, Urografin 370 and Cardioconray, and occurred following every injection in this study. Metrizamide, a non-ionic contrast medium, was found to be associated with a smaller fall in blood pressure of a shorter duration.","Converging research findings indicate that rumination is correlated with a specific maladaptive interpersonal style encapsulating submissive (overly-accommodating, non-assertive and self-sacrificing) behaviours, and an attachment orientation characterised by rejection sensitivity. This study examined the prospective longitudinal relationship between rumination, the submissive interpersonal style, and rejection sensitivity by comparing two alternative hypotheses: (a) the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity prospectively predict increased rumination; (b) rumination prospectively predicts the submissive interpersonal style and rejection sensitivity. Currently depressed (n = 22), previously depressed (n = 42) and never depressed (n = 28) individuals completed self-report measures assessing depressive rumination and key psychosocial measures of interpersonal style and behaviours, at baseline and again six months later. Baseline rejection sensitivity prospectively predicted increased rumination six months later, after statistically controlling for baseline rumination, gender and depression. Baseline rumination did not predict the submissive interpersonal style or rejection sensitivity. The results provide a first step towards delineating a potential casual relationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination, and suggest the potential value of clinical assessment and intervention for both rejection sensitivity and rumination in individuals who present with either difficulty.","###Answer:
- Target word: **Depression**
- Text A: Discusses the physiological effect of a drug causing myocardial depression, which refers to a decrease in the functioning or effectiveness of the myocardium (heart muscle) during medical procedures requiring contrast media. Here, ""depression"" is used specifically to detail a medical condition affecting heart muscle performance.
- Text B: Refers to the psychological state of depression, particularly examining the impacts of rumination, a cognitive process frequently associated with mood disorders like depression. This use focuses on psychological depression, exploring its relationships with interpersonal dynamics and susceptibility.

- Label: **Changed**
- Reason: The use of the word ""depression"" in these two texts represents a shift from a physiological context (myocardial depression) in Text A to a psychological aspect in Text B, reflecting a broader understanding and application of the term over time.

48,Depression,"The cardiovascular and haematological effects of purified prothrombin activator derived from the venom of the Australian Common Brown Snake (Pseudonaja textilis) were studied in anaesthetised, mechanically ventilated dogs. Severe depression of systemic blood pressure and cardiac output and a rise in central venous pressure were observed. Thrombocytopenia, prolongation of both prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and a reduction in serum fibrinogen were also observed. All of these observed effects were prevented by the prior administration of heparin--a naturally occurring anticoagulant. We conclude that the prothrombin activator in Pseudonaja textilis venom may cause cardiovascular depression due to myocardial dysfunction secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation.","Background The aim of the present study was to evaluate the knowledge and perception of depression among students of University Sains Malaysia (USM), in Penang, Peninsular Malaysia.Method Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a pre-validated 21-item questionnaire among students at USM.Results A total of 500 respondents participated in the survey comprising 24.6% (n=123) males and 75.4% (n=377) females. Half (50.0%, n=250) were Malays, followed by Chinese (44.0%, n=220) and Indians (6.0%, n=30). Whilst exploring the respondents' knowledge of the symptoms of depression, it was found that Chinese females had a comparatively better knowledge (P=0.058) of the symptoms of depression in comparison with Malays and Indians. Overall, social issues were attributed as the possible cause of depression. A cursory knowledge level was observed regarding medication for depression. Female students were more inclined towards the use of alternative and traditional medicines. However, with regard to seeking professional help, consultation with a psychiatrist was preferred by the majority.Conclusion Overall, a moderate level of knowledge about the symptoms of depression and a cursory knowledge of its therapy were observed. Those with personal experience of depression had better knowledge of the symptoms and therapy. Alternative treatments and traditional medicines were also favoured. There is a risk that this may affect the ability of Malaysian youths to seek evidence-based mental health care.","- Label: Changed

- Reason: In Text A, the term ""depression"" refers to a physiological decrease in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output caused by snake venom, representing a medical or physiological condition affecting physical body systems. This usage of the word is distinct and tied to a bodily response or function. Meanwhile, in Text B, the term ""depression"" pertains to a mental health condition characterized by a variety of symptoms and impacting emotional and psychological well-being. This usage aligns with the common modern understanding of depression as primarily a mental health disorder. Thus, the meaning of the word ""depression"" has experienced significant semantic drift, shifting from a physiological context to primarily a psychological one between the texts."
49,Depression,"The regulation of dihydrodipicolinate synthase (EC 4.2.1.52) and aspartate kinase (EC 2.7.2.4) was studied in Bacillus subtilis 168. Starvation for lysine gave depression of one aspartate kinase isoenzyme but not of dihydrodipicolinate synthase. Strains resistant to growth inhibition by the lysine analogue thiosine exhibited constitutively derepressed synthesis of one aspartate kinase isoenzyme but had normal levels of dihydrodipicolinate synthase. The data provide strong evidence that lysine is not the signal for derepression of dihydrodipicolinate synthase. Nevertheless, dihydrodipicolinate synthase specific activity increased during sporulation, and it is suggested that this increase may result, in part, from resistance to proteolysis of that enzyme.",Parents of very preterm infants are at great risk for experiencing stress and depression.

- Text A: The target word ""depression"" is used in a biochemical context relating to the suppression or reduction of enzyme activity. It discusses how the absence of lysine leads to the reduction (depression) in activity of an enzyme, which is a technical usage entirely focused on biochemistry.
- Text B: Here, ""depression"" refers to a mental health condition experienced by parents of very preterm infants, indicating feelings of sadness, stress, and emotional disturbance. This usage is aligned with the common psychological understanding of the term as a mood disorder.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The usage of the word ""depression"" has undergone a significant semantic drift from a biochemical context in Text A, where it denotes a reduction in enzyme activity, to a psychological context in Text B, where it describes a mental health condition.

50,Depression,"It is often pointed out that the incidence of monopolar depression, new type depressions and protracted depression has increased. Why have such types of depression been appearing more frequently than before? We should not overlook the possibility that changing modern society could actually result in increased depression.","Previous studies have found a connection between psychiatric problems and post-hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) complications. We sought to evaluate the effect of sertraline on engraftment time, hospitalization period, mortality, and post-transplantation complications in HSCT recipients with depression and/or anxiety. We recruited adults aged 18-60, who were candidates for autologous or allogeneic HSCT with major depression and/or anxiety disorder. They were administered 50 mg of sertraline or placebo daily for the first week, and then 100 mg for the following seven weeks. We documented occurrence and severity of early post-HSCT complications, including infection, mucositis, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, pain, renal toxicities and liver complications, acute graft-versus-host disease, and veno-occlusive disease, as well as time to engraftment, length of hospitalization and 6-month mortality. Overall, 56 patients participated in the study (sertraline group n = 30, placebo group n = 26). Of the complications, only mortality and readmission up to 6 months post-transplantation were significantly higher in the placebo group compared to sertraline group (P values = 0.040, 0.028, respectively). There were no significant differences for other complications between the groups. Mean engraftment time was significantly lower in the sertraline group (P value = 0.048). This study provides evidence that sertraline positively influences engraftment time, readmission, and mortality after HSCT.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The text discusses the increase in various types of depression (monopolar, new type, and protracted) and suggests that societal changes might be influencing the rising incidence of these types of depression. The context is more about societal influences on mental health and the changing nature of depression as a psychological or psychiatric condition.
- Text B: Here, the focus is on the clinical trial of sertraline (an antidepressant) and its effects on patients with major depression and/or anxiety undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""depression"" is framed within a broader sociocultural dialogue, suggesting an investigation into why certain types of depression are reportedly increasing and theorizing about societal influences on mental health. Conversely, Text B anchors ""depression"" firmly within a medical and clinical research context, examining the efficacy of a treatment for depression in a specific physiological procedure and its direct implications on health outcomes. The shift from a conceptual, society-focused view in Text A to a clinical, treatment-oriented perspective in Text B marks a significant semantic drift in the use of ""depression."" The semantic change reflects a shift from discussing depression as a general societal issue to addressing it as a medically-managed disease in precise, clinical terms."

This mixed-methods study conducted among Afghan and Iraqi refugee and asylum-seeker psychiatric patients aims to fill this gap. Associations between postmigration stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were significant. When differentiated for the two groups, associations with postmigration stress were no longer significant for Afghan patients, who were predominantly younger and more often single, lower educated, and without resident status compared with Iraqi patients. Qualitative results indicate that, in addition to psychopathology and postmigration stress, acculturation problems contribute to confusion of cultural identity. The findings suggest that reduction of postmigration stress and acculturation problems may clarify cultural identity and as such may contribute to posttraumatic recovery.","- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: Both Text A and Text B use the word ""depression"" within the context of mental health disorders, particularly as a term describing a significant component of psychological illness characterized by extreme sadness, low mood, and other symptomatic manifestations. In Text A, depression is mentioned specifically in relation to premenstrual syndrome affecting women's mood and behavior, signaling its alignment with a mental health condition. Text B extends this usage by discussing depression in the larger context of refugee mental health, linking it to anxiety, PTSD, and the stress of acculturation, thereby maintaining the consistency of the term's application as a mental health issue. The core conception of ""depression"" focusing on mental health remains central and similar in both texts despite different demographic focuses and nuanced contexts."
52,Depression,"Moclobemide is a reversible and selective inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) subtype A with a broad spectrum of antidepressant activity. Controlled clinical studies suggest that the short term clinical efficacy of moclobemide is significantly superior to that of placebo, and comparable to that of the tricyclic antidepressants clomipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine and desipramine, the irreversible MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine and the second-generation antidepressants maprotiline, mianserin and fluvoxamine in the treatment of major depressive illness. Moclobemide appears to be equally effective in endogenous and nonendogenous depression, producing marked amelioration of clinical features of psychomotor retardation and depressed mood. Moclobemide is well tolerated, being largely devoid of the anticholinergic adverse effects, symptomatic postural hypotension and weight gain variously associated with the tricyclic antidepressants and irreversible MAO inhibitors, and appears considerably safer on overdosage than the tricyclic and second generation antidepressants. Moreover, moclobemide offers the advantage over the older, irreversible MAO inhibitors of causing only minimal potentiation of the pressor response to dietary tyramine (the so-called 'cheese effect'). Consequently, the risk of potentially fatal hypertensive crisis, a major deterrent to the wider acceptance of these earlier compounds, is substantially reduced with moclobemide, and the need for dietary precautions is minimised. With its efficacy against endogenous and nonendogenous depression, relatively rapid onset of antidepressant activity, and absence of carry-over effects on treatment withdrawal, moclobemide is likely to make an important contribution to the treatment of major depressive illness. Its favourable tolerability profile, safety on overdosage and beneficial effect on age-related cognitive impairment may be of particular value in the elderly and those with concurrent physical illness.","Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent among patients seeking outpatient treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUD) and if depression and anxiety are addressed the prognosis is improved. Screening instruments for depression and anxiety have been validated in populations suffering from drug use disorders, but not in populations suffering from AUD. The aim of this study was to validate four self-administrated screening instruments (","### Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Moclobemide is described primarily as a treatment for major depressive illness. The drug is noted for improving symptoms such as psychomotor retardation and depressed mood, which are classic symptoms of clinical depression. The text primarily focuses on the pharmacological effects and benefits of moclobemide in treating depression, detailing its efficacy, tolerability, and safety.
- Text B: The term ""depression"" here relates to its role as a comorbid condition in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD). The text discusses the prevalence of depression and anxiety among these patients and stresses the importance of addressing these psychological conditions for better prognosis. It also explores the validation of screening instruments for depression in this specific patient population.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""depression"" maintains its meaning related to a state of psychological distress characterized by symptoms like low mood, which necessitates medical or therapeutic intervention. Although the contexts differ—one focusing on the treatment of depression in a general sense and the other within the context of alcohol use disorders—the fundamental understanding of what constitutes ""depression"" remains consistent, aligning with its medical and psychological definition. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the term's usage between the texts."
53,Depression,"Essential tremor (ET) is the most common type of movement disorder, although its etiology and neurophysiological substrates remain unclear. While thought to be a benign condition, it has yet to be studied from a neuropsychological perspective. We examined the neurocognitive functioning of 13 nondemented subjects with severe ET, including aspects of memory, cognitive flexibility, and attention. Results revealed that 12/13 subjects demonstrated impairment on 1 or more cognitive measures in comparison with published normative data. The pattern of findings was suggestive of relative dysfunction of frontal-mediated processes not unlike that seen in Parkinson's disease. These deficits were found in subjects irrespective of the presence of cognitive complaints, depression, or the existence of other potential neurocognitive risk factors. These findings suggest that mild cognitive deficits are not uncommon in association with severe ET and may be related to subcortical systems.","Assessing the risk to develop a specific disease is the first step towards prevention, both at individual and population levels. The development and validation of risk prediction models (RPMs) is the norm within different fields of medicine but still underused in psychiatry, despite the global impact of mental disorders. In particular, there is a lack of RPMs to assess the risk of developing depression, the first worldwide cause of disability and harbinger of functional decline in old age. We present the depression risk assessment tool DRAT-up, the first prospective RPM to identify late-life depression among community-dwelling subjects aged 60-75. The development of DRAT-up was based on appraisal of relevant literature, extraction of robust risk estimates, and integration into model parameters. A unique feature is the ability to estimate risk even in the presence of missing values. To assess the properties of DRAT-up, a validation study was conducted on three European cohorts, namely, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, the Invecchiare nel Chianti, and the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, with 20 206, 1359, and 3124 eligible samples, respectively. The model yielded accurate risk estimation in the three datasets from a small number of predictors. The Brier scores were 0.054, 0.133, and 0.041, respectively, while the values of area under the curve (AUC) were 0.761, 0.736, and 0.768, respectively. Sensitivity analyses suggest robustness to missing values: setting any individual feature to unknown caused the Brier scores to increase by 0.004 and the AUCs to decrease by 0.045 in the worst cases. DRAT-up can be readily used for clinical purposes and to aid policy-making in the field of mental health.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The description of 'depression' in Text A relates to a neurophysiological aspect, concluding a general depression or decline in respiratory function due to neurochemical interventions in research cats. The meaning of 'depression' here refers specifically to a reduction or inhibition of physiological activity.
- Text B: This text discusses 'depression' in a clinical psychiatric context, particularly referring to the mental health condition characterized by mood disturbance, affecting daily living and known as a major cause of disability. The focus is on the mental and emotional state impacting humans negatively and the development of tools to predict its risk.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The meaning of the word 'depression' has shifted from a physical or physiological state (decline in a specific function) in Text A to a well-defined psychological and mental health disorder with extensive social and health implications in Text B. Thus, the usage of the word reflects a significant change in context and connotation over time, marking a semantic drift from a general decline or reduction in function to a specific mental health condition."
54,Depression,"There is a high incidence of life event stress, depression, and associated symptoms in individuals with HIV infection/AIDS. Psychological and psychiatric symptomatology in individuals with HIV and AIDS may be related to the progression of AIDS disease. The association between depression, anxiety, and stress with HIV disease progression suggests that neurobiologic and neurophysiologic factors have an important role in modulating HIV. The immune effects caused by changes in behavioral state or brain activity are affected, at least in part, through the neuroendocrine-immune pathways. Life stress and depression may be associated with altered blood levels of CNS-released neuropeptides, including substance P (SP). SP is a powerful immunomodulator which is a critical link between the nervous and immune system. We have investigated the role of the neuropeptide SP and its preferred receptor, neurokinin-1, in HIV infection and AIDS. There are compelling data from our laboratories, as well as the findings in the literature, which demonstrate that SP may play an important role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, including stress and depression in HIV-infected individuals and in the immunopathogenesis of HIV disease. Modulation of SP activity and SP receptor may offer a novel approach to the treatment of psychiatric disorders and to the design of new anti-HIV therapy.","Sustaining a stroke, regardless of its severity, is a life-changing and often traumatizing event that can lead to chronic depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in both survivors and their family caregivers. Psychosocial interventions for emotional distress after stroke are limited, have emphasized psychoeducation rather than skills, treatment of chronic emotional distress rather than prevention, and have targeted either the patient or their caregiver without accounting for the context of their interpersonal relationship. Here we discuss ""Recovering Together,"" a novel program for dyads of patients with stroke and their family caregivers aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress by using cognitive behavioral principles to teach resiliency and interpersonal communication skills beginning during hospitalization in a neuroscience intensive care unit and continuing after discharge via telehealth. We illustrate the case of a pilot dyad enrolled in the Recovering Together program, to showcase how patients and caregivers can engage with and benefit from it. This dyad's experience suggests that Recovering Together is credible, feasible, and useful. The potential dyadic benefit of this intervention lies not only in providing the opportunity to optimize recovery and prevent long-term emotional distress, but also in creating the space to come together as a pair and make meaning from critical illness.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The passage discusses the role of psychological factors like depression in conjunction with HIV/AIDS, indicating how depression might be correlated with disease progression due to neurobiologic factors. Here, depression is described in a clinical and physiological context, emphasizing its interaction with the immune system and its potential impacts on health conditions like HIV.
- Text B: This text discusses depression in the context of a post-stroke scenario. It highlights the emotional and psychological afflictions, including depression, which can follow a stroke. The focus is on the preventative and therapeutic measures for managing emotional distress via a specific intervention program aimed at survivors and their caregivers.

- Label: **Unchanged**
- Reason: In both texts, the usage of ""depression"" aligns closely despite different health contexts (HIV/AIDS in Text A and post-stroke in Text B). In both cases, depression is discussed as a significant psychological condition with profound effects on physical health and quality of life. The implication of depression as a deep-seated emotional and mental health issue remains consistent, showing no significant shifts in meaning or connotation between the two texts. The clinical, psycho-emotional understanding of depression as a significant health factor is clear and constant across both contexts."
55,Depression,"The effects of inhalational anaesthetic agents on renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were compared in anaesthetized rabbits. Concentrations of 6% desflurane, 1.2% isoflurane, and 2.4% enflurane increased mean RSNA up to 32, 36 and 44% while higher concentrations, of 12, 2.4 and 3.2% depressed it by 42, 83 and 5%, respectively. For halothane RSNA was unchanged up to 0.8% and decreased by 36% at 1.6% concentration. Nitrous oxide increased RSNA up to 28% at 50% concentration. Maximum reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 60% for both 2.4% isoflurane and 3.2% enflurane, 50% for 12% desflurane and 1.6% halothane, while 70% nitrous oxide increased MAP by 22%. In conclusion, unlike the entirely depressive effects of halothane, the effects of desflurane, isoflurane and enflurane were biphasic involving excitation at lower concentrations and depression of RSNA and a reduction in MAP at higher concentrations. Nitrous oxide caused increases in both RSNA and MAP.",Pharmacological treatment of depression during pregnancy must balance the potential fetal risks of the medication with the risks of an undertreated or untreated depression. The choice of treatment is difficult and an increasing number of pregnant women and their doctors face the dilemma. There are non-pharmacological options for treatment but they may not be sufficient or available. The paper summarises the potential fetal effects of antidepressant use during pregnancy and attempts to put these effects in a clinical context.,"###Answer:
- **Label:** Changed
- **Reason:** In Text A, the term ""depression"" refers to a decrease or reduction in physiological activity, specifically renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) due to the administration of inhalational anesthetic agents. Here, ""depression"" denotes a lowered state of activity or suppression within a physical and clinical context. In contrast, Text B uses ""depression"" to describe a mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and other emotional and psychological symptoms. The context in Text B involves the considerations and treatments associated with psychological depression during pregnancy. This shift from a physiological or functional decrease to a mental health disorder illustrates a significant change in meaning and connotation of the word ""depression"" between the two texts."
56,Depression,Previous research has indicated that a subset of Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) items may be able to predict antidepressant treatment response to lithium. Twenty-one patients with major depressive disorder were assigned to treatment with lithium based on this MMPI lithium response scale. Twenty lithium-assigned patients completed the 4-week trial. Sixty percent of these patients showed a 50% reduction in Hamilton depression scores. This response rate is similar to results obtained in studies using no selection criteria in the treatment of depression with lithium.,"Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent mood disorders worldwide. Complete remission of symptoms is often difficult to achieve, despite following recommended treatment guidelines. Numerous antidepressants and anxiolytics exist, and new drugs are being developed constantly, yet the incidence of common mood disorders continues to rise. Despite the prevalence of these issues, mental health treatment has not evolved much in recent years. An exciting area of research uncovered in the past decade is the gut-brain-microbiome axis, a bi-directional communication pathway. Because the human microbiome is closely related to mood, research is being done to investigate whether probiotic supplementation could potentially affect symptoms of anxiety and depression.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Discusses clinical depression in the context of a psychological evaluation and treatment study, looking at the effectiveness of lithium in treating symptoms of major depressive disorder. The text uses the term ""depression"" in a strictly clinical and psychiatric context, referring to a diagnosable mental health condition.
- Text B: Broadens the term ""depression"" to a more generalized context of mood disorders, and elaborates on the bi-directional influences between depression and physical health, specifically through the gut-brain-microbiome axis. This text not only discusses depression in the clinical sense but also explores innovative research linking it to gut health, indicating a more holistic and interconnected understanding of depression.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The meaning of ""depression"" has expanded from a primarily clinical focus in Text A, dealing strictly with psychological assessment and medication response, to a broader, more interdisciplinary focus in Text B, where depression is linked with physical health and novel scientific concepts like the microbiome. The semantic field of the word has thus broadened to include new contexts and implications."

Coronary angiograms demonstrated an anomalous origin of the left circumflex coronary artery in case-1 and an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery in case-2. Furthermore transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed that both anomalous coronary arteries were running from the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva. The anatomical relation between the anomalous coronaries running from non-coronary sinus of valsalva and the great vessels was directly detectable by TEE.

- **Reason:** In both Text A and Text B, the term ""depression"" refers to the same core concept: a psychiatric disorder characterized by mood disturbances. Although the treatments and methods of addressing depression have evolved (from observing physical responses to using personalized genetic data), the fundamental meaning of the word, as used across both texts, remains focused on the clinical condition of depression itself."
59,Depression,"To study the value of 4-aminopyridine as an antidote to verapamil intoxication, we subjected 12 adult cats to verapamil poisoning by administering doses of 4.0-25.0 mg/kg verapamil by intravenous infusion. Six animals were given 4-aminopyridine 2 X 0.5 mg/kg i.v. after the verapamil infusion was stopped and the other six animals (the control group) were not. Verapamil caused profound cardiovascular depression and also partial neuromuscular block, both of which were completely reversed by 4-aminopyridine within 50 min, in spite of extremely high serum verapamil concentrations (ranging between 3,700 and 13,500 ng/ml). The six animals that received 4-aminopyridine survived the verapamil intoxication, whereas four of the six animals in the control group died. The results suggest that 4-aminopyridine may be useful in the treatment of verapamil intoxication.","Sex steroid hormones potently shape brain functions, including those critical to maintain mental health such as serotonin signaling. Use of oral contraceptives (OCs) profoundly changes endogenous sex steroid hormone levels and dynamics.

Here, we investigate whether use of OCs in healthy women is associated with a marker of the serotonin system in terms of serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) brain imaging.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, the term ""depression"" is used in a physiological or clinical context referring specifically to a reduction or diminution of physiological activity or function, such as cardiovascular activity and muscle response. It is mainly technical, used in a medical experiment involving the cardiovascular effects of verapamil and its antidote. In Text B, ""depression"" refers to the mental health condition characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection. This is linked to behavioral and psychological studies concerning the effects of oral contraceptives on mood and mental states. This illustrates a notable shift from a physiological context to a psychological or psychiatric context, thus confirming a semantic drift in the use of ""depression"" over the years."
60,Depression,"1. Effects of morphine sulphate (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg i.p.) on locomotor activity of male rats were observed for 8 h after single doses in non-tolerant rats. The lower three doses had only an excitatory effect, whereas the higher three doses caused initial depression followed by a delayed excitatory effect.2. The same doses of morphine were administered daily for 30 days. No tolerance developed within this time to the excitatory effect. The locomotor excitatory effect of the higher three doses of morphine became progressively more pronounced over treatment periods of 30 days (and 48 days for 20 mg/kg), while the latency to peak activity decreased.3. An explanation of these results is suggested on the basis of two different central drug-receptor interactions affecting motility.","To identify or use alcohol abuse and abuse in the IAMSPE elderly, through the application of AUDIT, socioeconomic characterization of the elderly, and problems associated with drinking and weight, if there is a relationship between depression and alcohol abuse.","- **Target word**: Depression

### Reason:
The usage of ""depression"" in Text A refers to a decrease or reduction in physiological activity, specifically locomotor activity in rats under the influence of morphine. This usage is aligned with a general reduction or suppression in a physiological context. In Text B, however, ""depression"" pertains clearly to the mental health condition characterized by pervasive low mood, low self-esteem, and a lack of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities, observed in humans. This represents a shift from a physiological reduction in activity to a clinical psychological state in human health. Therefore, the semantic drift is labeled as ""Changed"" due to this significant shift in context and meaning of the word ""depression"" from a physical to a psychological application."
61,Depression,"Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality world-wide. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic malarial infections cause immune depression, which predisposes the host to infection with other microorganisms. Specific clinical investigations have shown, for example, that those with malaria-attributable anaemia are particularly likely to have Salmonella septicaemia, and that asymptomatic malarial infection causes diminished response to polysaccharide vaccine. The results of clinical studies and experiments with animal models have revealed that malarial parasites can decrease their vertebrate host's effective humoral and cellular immune responses. In this review, the possible ways in which this malaria-induced immune impairment could affect the host's response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection are considered. Could malarial infection be one of the reasons for the persistence of tuberculosis in malaria-endemic regions?","Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a form of human mental retardation, is caused by loss of function mutations in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1). The protein product of FMR1, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein and may function as a translational suppressor. Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in hippocampal area CA1 is a form of synaptic plasticity that relies on dendritic protein synthesis. mGluR-LTD is enhanced in the mouse model of FXS, Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, suggesting that FMRP negatively regulates translation of proteins required for LTD. Here we examine the synaptic and cellular mechanisms of mGluR-LTD in KO mice and find that mGluR-LTD no longer requires new protein synthesis, in contrast to wild-type (WT) mice. We further show that mGluR-LTD in KO and WT mice is associated with decreases in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) surface expression, indicating a similar postsynaptic expression mechanism. However, like LTD, mGluR-induced decreases in AMPAR surface expression in KO mice persist in protein synthesis inhibitors. These results are consistent with recent findings of elevated protein synthesis rates and synaptic protein levels in Fmr1 KO mice and suggest that these elevated levels of synaptic proteins are available to increase the persistence of LTD without de novo protein synthesis.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Discusses ""immune depression"" as a condition where the immune system's normal functions are weakened or suppressed due to malaria, making the host susceptible to other infections.
- Text B: Refers to ""mGluR-LTD"" (long-term depression) in a neurological context, indicating a reduction in synaptic strength between neurons, specifically linked to protein synthesis in the brain and its effects on neural plasticity and memory functions.

In Text A, ""depression"" is related to a reduction in immune system function due to disease, which is a physiological context. In Text B, ""depression"" refers to a neurophysiological process affecting synaptic functions within the brain, demonstrating a clear contextual and semantic shift from an immunological to a neuroscientific usage. This change in usage illustrates a semantic drift in the term over different domains of science."
62,Depression,"A bioassay of technical-grade chlorothalonil for possible carcinogenicity was conducted by administering the test chemical in the diet to Osborne-Mendel rats and B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered chlorothalonil at one of two doses for 80 weeks, then observed for 30-31 weeks. Time-weighted average doses for both males and females were 5,063 or 10,126 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats of each sex; pooled controls consisted of the matched-control groups combined with 55 untreated male or female rats from similar bioassays of five other test chemicals. All surviving rats were killed at 110-111 weeks. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were administered chlorothalonil at one of two doses for 80 weeks, then observed for 11-12 weeks. Time-weighted average doses for males were 2,688 or 5,375 ppm, and for females, 3,000 or 6,000 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated mice of each sex; pooled controls consisted of the matched-control groups combined with 50 untreated male or female mice from similar bioassays of five other test chemicals. All surviving mice were killed at 91-92 weeks. Clinical signs that appeared with increasing frequency in dosed rats included hematuria and, from week 72 until termination of the study, bright-yellow urine. Since the dosed female mice did not have depression in mean body weights or decreased survival compared with the controls, they may have been able to tolerate a higher dose. In rats, adenomas and carcinomas of the renal tubular epithelium occurred with a significant dose-related trend in both the males (P=0.030) and the females (P=0.007). These neoplasms also occurred at a higher incidence in the high-dose males (P=0.035) and the high-dose females (P=0.016) than in the corresponding controls (males: pooled controls 0/62, low-dose 3/46, high-dose 4/49; females: pooled controls 0/62, low-dose 1/48, high-dose 5/50). These tumors included both adenomas and carcinomas which are considered to be histogenically related. Thus these findings are interpreted as sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of chlorothalonil. In mice, no tumors were found to occur at a greater incidence among dosed animals than among controls. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, technical-grade chlorothalonil was carcinogenic to Osborne-Mendel rats, producing tumors of the kidney. Chlorothalonil was not carcinogenic for B6C3F1 mice.","Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition characterized by the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, which leads to heartburn and regurgitation. GERD has been categorized its types according to severity. The categories that have been discussed in this study are reflux esophagitis (RE), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), and Barrett's esophagus. Our study compared various studies and showed that the subjects with GERD had a high level of anxiety and depression. Gastroesophageal reflux disease has a significant negative impact on the quality of life (QoL) by perturbing daily activities. The majority of GERD patients use antacid drugs to control their acid symptoms. However, these symptoms are sometimes difficult to control, even with the most potent proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), and these patients tend to have a lower response rate. According to the clinical data, Anxiety and Depression are linked to the development of GERD. A major focus of this study is to explore psychological influences such as anxiety and depression and how they relate to GERD. This study also reviews the effect of these conditions on the younger population. It is concluded that the quality of life (QoL) of subjects with GERD is reduced by depression and anxiety.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The usage of ""depression"" in Text A refers to a reduced functionality or decrease in some aspect – specifically related to physiological effects in a bioassay studying carcinogenicity. Here, ""depression"" does not pertain to the psychological sense, but instead uses a broader, more general definition regarding a decline or reduction in a certain variable or condition (i.e., no depression in mean body weights).
- Text B: In Text B, ""depression"" clearly refers to the psychological condition, mentioned as a factor influencing the quality of life of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The context explicitly links ""depression"" with psychological influences that perturb daily activities and affect patient responses to treatments.

63,Depression,"Post-operative psychosis is a frequent complication after open-heart surgery. To investigate relationships between psychopathological outcome and endocrine and psychological variables, serum levels of cortisol, beta-endorphin, norepinephrine, TSH, and cholesterol were measured in 23 male patients undergoing aortic valve replacement from the day before operation (OP) until the seventh day after OP. State and trait anxiety, stress appraisal and the use of coping styles also were assessed. After OP, eight patients suffered from post-OP psychosis and nine from minor psychopathological symptoms. Post-OP psychopathology was significantly correlated with pre-OP psychopathological score as well as with state anxiety, pre- and post-OP stress, and the use of a self-controlling coping style. Serum cortisol, beta-endorphin, norepinephrine, and TSH levels were markedly elevated after OP. Cholesterol levels showed a decline. With regard to endocrine variables, the eight psychotic patients did not differ from 15 non-psychotic subjects, but a subgroup of three major depressed patients had distinctly elevated levels of cortisol and norepinephrine. For all 23 patients, pre-OP cholesterol correlated with pre-OP psychopathology and post-OP depression. Furthermore, post-OP depression was significantly correlated with both post-OP cortisol and norepinephrine. These results indicate the stressful nature of the OP and suggest a multifactorial association of endocrine and psychological variables with psychiatric complications after open-heart surgery.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence. Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression.","###Answer:

####Reason:
While in Text A the term ""depression"" is used in a broader context which might include psychological symptoms alongside other physiological markers following surgery, in Text B, it explicitly refers to a well-defined psychiatric condition, indicating a shift from a more general or physiological implication to a specific psychological disorder with structured treatments. This showcases semantic drift from a broader application of the term to its specific use in mental health contexts over time."
64,Depression,"The purpose of this study was to assess whether the chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, as a realistic animal model of depression, affects the rhythms of the locomotor activity in rats. Rhythm parameters (period, mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and percent rhythm) were estimated from the best-fitted cosine function curves. Period is the length, mesor is the mean level, amplitude (A) is the extent, acrophase is the timing of the rhythm; percent rhythm represents the variability estimated by the cosine regression and expressed as a percentage of the total variability of raw data. The animals were kept on the 12 L : 12 D cycle during 13 weeks of the experiment and subjected to CMS for first 4 weeks. In week 5 the rats were under the constant light for 24 h a day (LL), and in week 9, under the constant darkness (DD). In LD 12:12 CMS decreased the activity in the dark phase by approximately 50% (p < 0.01) and did not change the activity in the light phase, resulting in a drop of the 24 h activity by about 40% in comparison to controls. The amplitude of diurnal variations of the activity was highly statistically different from zero at p(A = 0) < 0.0001, and the percent rhythm was in range of 40-75% in both the CMS and control groups. The mesor and the amplitude of the diurnal rhythm (with a period of 24 h) in the CMS rats were significantly (p < 0.001) lower than those in the control. In LL, the activity of both groups was diminished about 50% during the subjective dark phase. On the other hand, in the subjective light phase the activity of CMS rats only was diminished. The percent rhythm for the CMS and control rats was 30 and 58%, respectively, and values of mesor, amplitude, and acrophase for both groups were highly statistically different. In DD, the activity in the CMS group was statistically significantly lower in both the subjective dark and light phases. In contrast to the results from LL, the cosine curves from DD were similarly shifted in relation to the subjective light-dark cycle. After a restoration of the LD cycle the levels of the 24-h activity of both groups became equal in the 13th week, but the light and dark phase differences between the groups were still statistically significant (p < 0.05). The present results indicate that CMS exerts distinct and prolonged disturbances of the diurnal and circadian rhythms of the locomotor activity in the rats.","Coronary artery spasm is a known cause of acute coronary syndrome. However, left main coronary spasm is an extremely rare entity and can present in different ways depending on the duration and severity of the spasm. We present a 44-year-old female patient who presented with transient ST elevation in the lead aVR and ST depression in the lateral and inferior leads. Coronary angiography showed mid left main and ostial right coronary artery spasm that significantly improved after intracoronary nitroglycerine administration. Intravascular ultrasound showed no significant left main coronary atherosclerosis. She was treated chronically with calcium channel blockers (CCB), nitrates, and arginine with significant improvement. In conclusion, left main coronary spasm is an extremely rare entity with wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Definite etiology is still questionable, and special precaution is needed during coronary angiography in order not to be confused with significant fixed lesions. Intravascular ultrasound can be valuable in excluding underlying atherosclerosis. Medical management with nitrates acutely then CCB is the mainstay of chronic management with PCI preserved to refractory cases.","- Target word: Depression

65,Depression,"Lens myo-inositol (MI) content is regulated by a pump-leak system consisting of an active Na-dependent MI transport and its passive permeability through the membrane. We measured the active MI uptake and membrane permeability in lenses of rats maintained on a 50% galactose diet for 1, 3 and 7 days. After only 1 day of galactose feeding, active MI uptake in the lens was reduced dramatically by 74% compared to age-matched control lenses; by day 3, active MI transport was decreased by 89% and it was undetectable by day 7. The passive membrane permeability was determined by measuring (a) the passive MI influx and (b) the 3H-sorbitol flux. After 1 day of galactose feeding, the membrane permeability increased such that within 3 days it increased to 5-6 fold. Galactose feeding also led to a rapid increase in lens polyol content. After 1 day, lens polyol increased to 53 mumol/g wet wt compared to a control value of 0.35 mumol/g wet wt and increased further to 65 and 72 mumol/g wet wt after 3 and 7 days of galactose feeding respectively. Lens galactose accumulation was low (3 mumol/g wet wt) up to 7 days; however, it was rapidly increased after 7 days. Our results indicate that galactose feeding rapidly interfered with MI homeostasis by a severe depression of active MI transport and a rapid increase in membrane permeability. These interferences of MI homeostasis correlate with the appearance of high polyol levels.","Burnout, depression, and suicide among health care professionals and learners have reached a rampant level.

66,Depression,"Type I diabetic cardiomyopathy has consistently been shown to be associated with decrease of repolarising K(+) currents, but the mechanisms responsible for the decrease are not well defined. We investigated the streptozotocin (STZ) rat model of type I diabetes. We utilized RNase protection assay and Western blot analysis to investigate the message expression and protein density of key cardiac K(+) channel genes in the diabetic rat left ventricular (LV) myocytes. Our results show that message and protein density of Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 are significantly decreased as early as 14 days following induction of type I diabetes in the rat. The results demonstrate, for the first time, that insulin-deficient type I diabetes is associated with early downregulation of the expression of key cardiac K(+) channel genes that could account for the depression of cardiac K(+) currents, I(to-f) and I(to-s). These represent the main electrophysiological abnormality in diabetic cardiomyopathy and is known to enhance the arrhythmogenecity of the diabetic heart. The findings also extend the extensive list of gene expression regulation by insulin.","The COVID-19 virus has become a fearful epidemic for people all over the world. In Turkey, long quarantine periods and curfews have increased both physical and psychological problems. Due to the rapid spread and substantial impact of the COVID-19 virus, different psychological effects were observed among different segments of society, such as among young people, elderly people, and active workers. Because of fear caused by the COVID-19 virus, it is thought that depression, stress, and anxiety levels have increased. It is estimated that there are more psychological issues for people with poor health and others whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. To explore and test the situation mentioned above, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Turkey with 3287 participants above 16 years old. We measured COVID-19 fear, along with anxiety, stress, and depression levels (DASS21) and demographics. Firstly, we tested whether COVID-19 fear predicts stress, anxiety, and depression. Secondly, we investigated if the effect of COVID-19 fear is stronger for those who have underlying illness and for those whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. The results showed that women and 16-25 years old youths have higher COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between COVID-19 fear and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as significant moderation effects of having an underlying illness and having friends or family who were infected or have died. These results show the importance of implementing specific implementations, particularly for vulnerable groups, to minimize the psychological problems that may arise with the pandemic.","- Target Word: Depression

- Text A: This text extensively details the effects of type I diabetes on specific cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities, specifically pinpointing how insulin deficiency and gene expression alterations lead to depression (reduction) of cardiac K(+) currents. Here ""depression"" is used in its physiological or mechanical sense, indicating a decrease or diminishment in function.

- Text B: The usage of ""depression"" in this context is related to its psychological or emotional sense, describing an affective state characterized by feelings of sadness, lowered mood, and an inability to find pleasure in activities that were previously enjoyed, primarily as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic's socioeconomic and personal impacts.

- Label: Changed

- Reason: The meaning of ""depression"" has undergone significant semantic drift from Text A to Text B. In Text A, ""depression"" refers to a reduction in physiological function (specifically cardiac K(+) currents), which is a technical and clinical use of the term within the domain of medical science. In Text B, ""depression"" is used to describe a psychological condition affecting mental health, which aligns with its more common contemporary understanding in the context of mental wellness. This change in context and usage indicates a semantic drift in the word ""depression"" between the two texts from different periods."
67,Depression,"Past research has suggested the potential importance of considering emotional reliance, a dimension of interpersonal dependence, when addressing social and developmental risk factors for depression. Based on a probability sample of 1,393 adults aged 18-55 residing in Toronto, Canada, this paper addresses gender differences in emotional reliance and the relevance of emotional reliance in explaining the gender-depression association. We also explore link-ages between emotional reliance and status factors. Findings indicate that emotional reliance is significantly related to depression and that women report greater reliance than men, independent of social status factors like marital and parental status, education, income, and occupational prestige. Moreover, the positive association between emotional reliance and depression is greater for women. Several social status factors modify the relationship between gender and emotional reliance. Both education and occupational prestige reduce reliance, and are particularly beneficial in this regard for women. Marriage, on the other hand, increases emotional reliance, especially for men. We offer interpretations of this pattern of findings.","A large range of neuroadaptations develop in response to chronic opioid exposure and these are thought to be more or less critical for expression of the major features of opioid addiction: tolerance, withdrawal and processes that may contribute to compulsive use and relapse. This review considers these adaptations at different levels of organization in the nervous system including tolerance at the mu-opioid receptor itself, cellular tolerance and withdrawal in opioid-sensitive neurons, systems tolerance and withdrawal in opioid-sensitive nerve networks, as well as synaptic plasticity in opioid sensitive nerve networks. Receptor tolerance appears to involve enhancement of mechanisms of receptor regulation, including desensitization and internalization. Adaptations causing cellular tolerance are more complex but several important processes have been identified including upregulation of cAMP/PKA and cAMP response element-binding signalling and perhaps the mitogen activated PK cascades in opioid sensitive neurons that might not only influence tolerance and withdrawal but also synaptic plasticity during cycles of intoxication and withdrawal. The potential complexity of network, or systems adaptations that interact with opioid-sensitive neurons is great but some candidate neuropeptide systems that interact with mu-opioid sensitive neurons may play a role in tolerance and withdrawal, as might activation of glial signalling. Implication of synaptic forms of learning such as long term potentiation and long term depression in opioid addiction is still in its infancy but this ultimately has the potential to identify specific synapses that contribute to compulsive use and relapse.","### Answer:

- Target word: Depression

### Text A Analysis:
In Text A, the term ""depression"" is used primarily in the context of a psychological and emotional state related to interpersonal dependence and emotional reliance. The discussion revolves around how emotional reliance correlates significantly with depression and how this association is influenced by various social status factors like gender, occupation, and marital status. The depression referred to is a mood disorder characterized by persistent sadness and lack of interest, which is fundamentally linked to human psychology.

### Text B Analysis:
Text B discusses ""depression"" in a physiological and bio-mechanical context associated with opioid addiction and its neurological effects. This usage refers to neurological ""depression"" as a reduction or suppression in biological activity, particularly referring to the response of opioid-sensitive nerve networks, receptor operations, and overall neuroplasticity during substance addiction cycles.

### Conclusion:
- Label: Changed

- Reason:
Between Text A and Text B, the usage of the term ""depression"" has undergone a significant shift in meaning. In Text A, ""depression"" is examined as a psychological condition impacting mental health directly tied to emotional and social factors. In contrast, Text B uses ""depression"" to describe a state of decreased physiological activity and response within the context of opioid addiction, focusing on neurological and biological mechanisms rather than emotional or psychological states. This demonstrates a semantic drift from a psychological/social interpretation to a physiological/neurological one."
68,Depression,"The objective was to present naturalistic 1-year follow-up information of 96 child and adolescent outpatients with major depressive disorder who had been randomized in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine. Subjects were children and adolescents, ages 8-18 years, who were entered in a randomized clinical trial of fluoxetine. Following the acute treatment trial, treatment was not controlled. At 6 months and 1 year, the subjects and parents were interviewed using the Kiddie Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (K-LIFE) for course of depression. Eighty-seven of the 96 subjects were followed for 1 year. Of these, 74 (85%) recovered from the depressive episode during that time (47 on fluoxetine, 22 on no medication, and 5 on other antidepressants or lithium). Twenty-nine of the subjects (39%) who recovered had a recurrence of depression during the 1-year follow-up, with 55% of these occurring within 6 months. Results of this study are similar to adult studies, with respect to response and recovery of depressive episodes. Most patients (85%) recover from the episode within 1 year, but approximately 40% have a recurrence within 12 months, which is a higher recurrence rate than in adults. Recovery was associated with younger age, lower severity of depressive symptoms, higher family functioning, and fewer comorbid diagnoses. Recurrence, which occurs both on and off medication, was difficult to predict, as there was little clinical data associated with recurrence in this population.","According to the World Health Organization, depression has become the leading cause of disability in the world, contributing significantly to the burden of health issues especially in the industrialized countries. This is a major public health problem, with potential impact on work climates, productivity at work and the continued existence of the organizations. Some recent studies have examined potential links between professional factors and common mental health disorders, but none have demonstrated a direct causal link.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The text describes a clinical study focusing on the treatment and recurrence of depression in children and adolescents who participated in a clinical trial for fluoxetine, a medication. Here, ""depression"" is clearly used in its psychiatric sense, referring to the mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, low energy, and a lack of interest in activities.
- Text B: This text discusses depression in a broader, more societal context, highlighting its role as a significant public health issue leading to disability. It points out the impact of depression on work environments, productivity, and organizational sustainability. Again, ""depression"" is used with its primary psychiatric meaning, referring to the mood disorder that affects mental health and functioning.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, although the specifics of the studies and focuses differ, the essential meaning of ""depression"" as a mental health condition remains consistent. Both A and B use the term in the context of discussing its impacts and treatments related to the mental health disorder, without deviating into other possible meanings or connotations of the word."
69,Depression,"Rabbit antisera (APS) against normal guinea pig peritoneal exudate polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), when injected intraperitoneally three times within 24 h into guinea pigs, lead to a marked fall in the blood PMN count (below 100/mm3) 24-72 h after the injection and a mild depression in the number of circulating mononuclear leukocytes (MNC) at 36-72 h. APS treatment of guinea pigs led to a marked suppression of delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions in response to dinitrophenylated bovine gamma-globulin. The volume, induration, mean diameter of the reaction and leukocyte (both PMN and MNC) emigration into local sites were suppressed, as was, to a lesser extent, vascular permeability. Based on these observations it appears that circulating PMN are required for the full expression of delayed hypersensitivity reaction engendered by bovine gamma-globulin.","Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is the preferred option of postremission therapy for high-risk patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

70,Depression,"One hundred and twenty undergraduate women students reported their height and weight and completed the Eating Disorder Questionnaire (EDQ), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Family Assessment Device (FAD), the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), the Body Image Assessment (BIA), and measures of peer and media influence. Family functioning was shown to be a poor predictor of bulimic behavior, whereas peer influence was a significant predictor. Media influence interacted with body dysphoria to increase the likelihood of bulimic behavior. The BSQ was a better predictor of bulimic behavior than the BIA, suggesting that students' responses to a measure that asks questions about specific areas of the body may reflect their feelings of body dysphoria more accurately than a measure that relies on a generalized silhouette.","Calf suckling and oxytocin injections are commonly used for pre-milking stimulus in dairy buffaloes under field conditions. A study was conducted to investigate effect of these treatments on reproductive performance. Fifty one Nili-Ravi buffaloes were monitored from parturition up to 150 days postpartum through rectal examination. Data on milk yield, body condition score (BCS) and reproductive parameters were recorded weekly. Postpartum ovulation interval (POI) was determined by presence of an ovulation depression or a very soft corpus luteum haemorrhagicum and was confirmed through milk progesterone levels (MPL). Suckling was used to stimulate milk let down, and where the calf had died, injection of oxytocin was resorted to. Milk samples were analyzed for MPL using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fat; and milk yield was converted to 4% fat corrected milk (FCM). The mean postpartum uterine involution length (PUI) was 34.30+/-1.33 days. Mean POI was 59.37+/-4.76 days and mean postpartum estrus interval (PEI) was 69.03+/-6.03 days. Suckling period averaged 26.40+/-5.57 days and correlated with POI (r=0.19, P<0.01) and PEI (r=0.23, P<0.01). POI was shortest in buffaloes suckled for one month (P<0.05). Oxytocin was used with a mean dosage of 7.50 IU, delaying placental expulsion time (PET) and POI but shortening PEI. BCS shortened PET, POI and PEI (P<0.01). Mean FCM was 14.50+/-0.20, ranging from 2 to 35 kg/d; and was higher in estrus group; correlating positively with POI (r=0.31, P<0.01). MPL were 1.37+/-0.17 ng/ml and increased after ovulation, remaining greater than 1.5 ng/ml from Day 4 to 14 of the estrus cycle, followed by a rapid decline up to next estrus. BCS in buffaloes resuming oestrus was constantly higher than those failing to resume ovarian cyclicity. Live weight, prepartum was 510.0+/-5.9 kg with a loss of 3.7+/-2.12 kg, 30 days postpartum. The present study suggests a lower reproductive efficiency of dairy buffaloes under the peri-urban farming system reflected by ovarian cyclicity in 68.63% buffaloes within 150 days postpartum and silent estrus in 51.5% of the cases. Increasing suckling duration and use of oxytocin delayed POI, however, POI was shortest in buffaloes suckled for one month. The high yielding buffaloes also manifested better reproductive cyclicity; while moderate yielder showed shorter ovulation intervals and higher conception rate.","###Answer:

72,Depression,"Total T4 and T3 concentrations are often suppressed in burned patients. To investigate the significance of such changes, we have characterized serum T4 and T3 after full-thickness scald burns (60% body surface under anesthesia) of 270-gm male Sprague-Dawley rats housed in a light:dark cycle of 14:10 hr. Groups (N = 9-15) of BURN, SHAM (anesthesia, fur clipped, no burn) and CON (controls) were sacrificed on postburn days 8 and 14.

73,Depression,"Techniques have been developed to introduce specific genes from one species into the germplasm of another, including livestock. This paper reviews reports on evaluation, selection, and breeding procedures for introduction and multiplication of transgenes in breeding populations of livestock. Before transgenes are introduced and multiplied in commercial breeding populations, it is necessary to test transgenics extensively for both favorable and unfavorable transgene effects. Parent stock used to produce transgenic founder animals should be selected to excel in polygenic breeding value for economically important traits, especially if founder animals or their sons are to be used directly by AI in commercial populations. However, polygenic breeding value of founder transgenic animals and inbreeding depression are of negligible importance if a transgene is introgressed into a selection nucleus population from three or four generations of backcrossing. Transgenic development should be economically viable for traits with major effects on net merit, especially in the dairy industry, where transgenic sires can be used extensively by AI. A minimum effect of about 10% of the mean (or one phenotypic standard deviation) is a reasonable approximation of the minimum transgene effect that would be necessary to justify introgression into a nucleus swine population. A transgene effect of 10 to 20% of the mean would be required for most economic traits in beef cattle.","Despite promising new therapies, bipolar depression remains difficult to treat.

Depressant effects were observed in all variables initially; some cardiovascular variables eventually exceeded preinjection values after the higher (3.0 mg/kg) dose level. At a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, significant depression in myocardial contractility persisted for 20 minutes, and at 3.0 mg/kg for 50 minutes. Stroke volume was minimally affected initially, although significant increases occurred at 40 and 50 minutes after the 3.0 mg/kg injections. Heart rate was depressed by 5% and 7% in the animals given the small and large doses. Values were within control levels by 90 minutes after the anesthetic was injected, except respiratory rate and body temperature. We conclude that the dissociative anesthetic used produces neither marked nor prolonged cardiovascular effects. Since cardiovascular effects are absent by 90 minutes after the anesthetic was injected, dissociative anesthesia is a desirable technique for minor surgical procedures and restraint, especially before physiologic studies.","The developmental impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and other antidepressant treatments during gestation and postpartum on anxiety and depression behaviors in offspring is unclear. This review focuses on how perinatal exposure to SSRI and other antidepressant may have long term consequences for these affective behaviors during early childhood and beyond. Outcomes vary and consideration is given to methodological factors related to how early SSRI exposure affects developments studied in rodent models such as: a) between pre- and early post-natal SSRI exposure, b) sex, c) experimental models of gestational maternal stress and d) impact of non-SSRI antidepressant medications. We will also review how multiple contextual factors (maternal caregiving and gene x environment interactions) may contribute to the effects of perinatal SSRI exposure and maternal mental illness on affective behaviors in children.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Highlights the physiological effects of a dissociative anesthetic on rhesus macaques, specifically mentioning ""depressant effects"" on variables like heart rate and myocardial contractility, where ""depression"" is used to describe a reduction or diminution in physiological functions.
- Text B: Discusses the psychological impact of antidepressant treatments, mentioning ""depression behaviors"" in relation to affective behaviors affected by perinatal exposure to SSRI and antidepressant treatments. Here, ""depression"" refers to the clinical condition affecting mental health.

75,Depression,"The vulnerability-accumulation (or scarring) hypothesis postulates that the experience of depression induces a lasting increase in vulnerability, and through this raises the risk of recurrence. We examined the validity of the vulnerability-accumulation model for depressive episodes in later life. The sample comprised 26 elderly persons who had remitted from a depressive episode and 96 control respondents who were all selected from the participants of a large community survey among persons aged 57 years or more. Several psychosocial vulnerability indicators were assessed premorbidly, during the depressive episode and after remission. High levels of psychological distress, low life satisfaction, chronic somatic diseases, high neuroticism, and low scores on extraversion, mastery, and self-efficacy appeared to be predictors of depression in this sample. During the depressive episode, psychological distress was higher and life satisfaction, physical, role, and social functioning, as well as feelings of self-efficacy lower than before the episode. Physical and role functioning, cognitive function, and self-efficacy were lower after remission compared to premorbid levels, but (other) personality indices had not changed after remission compared to premorbid levels. Furthermore, we failed to find differences between first and recurrent episodes. Support for the vulnerability-accumulation model was limited at the most. Although psychosocial scarring may occur in the elderly, our findings tentatively suggest that this accumulation does not manifest itself in major vulnerability indicators such as neuroticism.","The role of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use in social differences in terms of depression is poorly understood.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A (older text, medical and psychological focus): This text represents a traditional view of depression as a clinical and psychological condition affecting individuals. It discusses the vulnerability-accumulation model in the context of depressive episodes, specifically examining various physical, psychological, and social factors affecting individuals during and after a depressive episode. This text is focused on understanding and identifying the biological and psychological predictors of depression, such as low life satisfaction, neuroticism, and physical functioning.

- Text B (more recent text, societal context): This text briefly touches on depression, particularly in how it may be influenced by social factors like alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use. The focus here shifts slightly from individual psychological and biological factors to societal and behavioral influences on depression.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The concept of ""depression"" shows a semantic drift from being predominantly discussed in clinical and psychological terms centered around individual vulnerabilities and psychosocial factors in Text A, to including an understanding shaped by societal and lifestyle factors (alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use) in Text B. This indicates a broadening of the contexts and factors associated with depression, reflecting changes in how the term is understood and discussed in different domains and disciplines, including public health and social sciences."
76,Depression,"Myelosuppression in patients with cancer is usually the result of tumor invasion of the bone marrow, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, all of which suppress bone marrow function. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia are the three most clinically significant complications that result from bone marrow depression. Although anemia and thrombocytopenia can produce serious clinical problems, blood-component transfusions--despite having inherent problems of their own--usually are successful in correcting or minimizing these complications. Although neutropenia is manageable in most situations, it remains a serious problem that, at its worst, can progress to life-threatening septicemia. The longer neutrophil counts remain low, the more susceptible patients become to infection by endogenous and exogenous microbial flora. Accordingly, the oncology nurse increases the frequency of patient assessment and monitoring for infection. Control measures are introduced to minimize environmental contaminants. These measures attempt to reduce the incidence of opportunistic infections that frequently occur in patients with severe or prolonged neutropenia and for which antimicrobial therapy is indicated. Implementing specific infection-control interventions and thoroughly educating the patient and his/her family help to limit the clinical problems associated with myelosuppression for most patients.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease worldwide and displays many atopic, but also non-atopic comorbidities.

77,Depression,"We evaluated the possible cardioprotective effects of enflurane (E) and isoflurane (I) in isolated rat hearts subjected to 40 min normothermic arrest. After reperfusion, hearts were stimulated with adrenaline to evaluate their systolic reserves. In hearts not receiving I or E, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was reduced from 23.0 +/- 0.8 to 9.3 +/- 1.1 mumol/g dry weight (means +/- SEM; P < 0.001) after arrest. This was associated with a significant reduction in ventricular work (Wt) from 13.6 +/- 0.7 to 1.6 +/- 0.7 mW (P < 0.001). Adrenaline partially restored Wt but not the ATP. E and I given only during normothermic arrest (in the cardioplegic solution) resulted in reductions in ATP similar to the hearts not receiving the drugs. However, on reperfusion and subsequent administration of adrenaline, hearts subjected to the anesthetic drugs performed as well as hearts before arrest. For example, in hearts not exposed to I or E, the Wt after the elective arrest was 1.55 +/- 0.05% (mean +/- SEM) of the pre-arrest value. This was significantly less than hearts exposed to either one of the inhalational agents (40.02 +/- 3.49% of the pre-arrest value; P < 0.0001). Adrenaline improved function in hearts which did not receive I or E to 55.02 +/- 12.80% of the pre-arrest value, but this was significantly less than the Wt performed by the hearts exposed to the anesthetic agents (122.67 +/- 7.78% of pre-arrest value; P < 0.001). This beneficial effect of I and E during reperfusion probably is mediated by the effect of the anesthetic agents on Ca2+ slow channels. The effect could not be ascribed to depression of global myocardial contractile function associated with I and E.","The objective is to present the design of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a behavioural graded activity programme compared with manual therapy in patients with sub-acute neck pain. Sub-acute is defined as pain existing for 4-12 weeks. The behavioural graded activity programme is a time-contingent increase in activities from baseline towards pre-determined goals. Manual therapy consists mainly of specific spinal mobilization techniques and exercises. The primary outcomes are global perceived effect and functional status. Secondary outcomes are kinesiophobia, distress, coping, depression and somatization. The intensity and persistence of the pain and its interference with activities are also assessed. Direct and indirect costs are measured by means of cost diaries. Measurements take place at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after randomization. To assess the long-term effect, measurements will also take place after 6 and 12 months. Finally some challenges are discussed concerning the use of a behavioural graded activity programme, manual therapy and outcomes.","###Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The discussion surrounds the use of enflurane (E) and isoflurane (I) in isolated rat hearts, and mentions ""depression"" in the context of a reduction in myocardial contractile function. Here, ""depression"" refers to a physiological decrease in the function of the heart muscle during a controlled scientific experiment.
- Text B: The excerpt talks about a clinical trial concerning neck pain treatments and lists ""depression"" as one of the secondary outcomes to be measured. In this context, ""depression"" clearly refers to a psychological condition, affecting mood and overall mental health.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""depression"" is used to describe a decrease in a specific physiological function (heart muscle activity), which is a medical and somewhat mechanical usage of the word. In Text B, ""depression"" refers to the psychological state or mental health condition characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection. This reflects a significant shift in the usage and meaning of the word ""depression"" from physiological to psychological contexts between the two texts."
78,Depression,"Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.","Depression and antidepressants are among risk factors for osteoporosis. However, there are still inconsistencies in literature regarding bone consequences of antidepressant drugs and the role of age and the natural decline of bone health in patients with depression.","### Answer:

- **Target word:** Depression

- **Text A:** Depression is described in the context of common psychiatric disorders affecting multiple age groups, where symptoms like sadness, worthlessness, and physical symptoms are highlighted. It discusses the role of primary care physicians in diagnosing and managing depression, highlighting the emotional and psychological aspects typical of a clinical depression diagnosis.

- **Text B:** Depression is discussed with a focus on its implications in other health areas, specifically its role as a risk factor for osteoporosis and the effects of antidepressants on bone health. The usage here merges psychological aspects of depression with physical health outcomes, linking mental health directly with physical diseases.

- **Label:** Changed

- **Reason:** Between the two texts, there is a noticeable shift in the connotation and associated aspects of the term ""depression."" While Text A focuses on traditional clinical symptoms and the diagnostic process by mental health professionals, Text B expands the context to include depression's impact on physical health conditions like osteoporosis, indicating an evolution in how the implications of depression are perceived and studied. The semantic drift from purely a psychological condition to a factor influencing physical health illustrates a broadening in the understanding and discussion of depression beyond the mental health sphere."
79,Depression,"Athymic nude mice and euthymic litter mates with BALB/cA back-ground were infected intranasally with a strain of Sendai virus. While no severe illness occurred in euthymic litter mates, some of nude mice showed marked body weight loss and died within 3 weeks after infection. The remaining nude mice recovered from the early depression and survived for 6 weeks or more with chronic pulmonary lesions. The virus was demonstrable in lungs of these chronic cases up to 10 weeks after infection, and none of infected nude mice were found to have anti-Sendai virus antibodies. Pulmonary lesions were characterized by diffuse interstitial pneumonia with a high incidence of prominent adenomatous metaplasia of alveolar epithelium.","The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence rate and risk factors of depression in outpatients who were diagnosed with PE. Therefore, between September 2009 and September 2011, 1801 outpatients at andrology clinics were enrolled and consented to participate in our survey by completed a verbal questionnaire. It included the following: (1) demographic data (e.g., age, body mass index), (2) PE duration, medical history, and sexual history, (3) self-estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency times, (4) the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and (5) the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) and (6) the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). The results showed that a total of 1,206 patients were diagnosed with PE. The prevalence rate of depression in these PE patients was 26.78%. Depression was associated with PE duration, NIH-CPSI score, and IIEF-5 score. Risk factors for depression specifically included PE durations for 13-24, 25-60, or ≥61 months, CPSI scores of 15-30 or ≥31, and IIEF-5 scores <22. These findings suggested that several associated factors (PE duration, CPSI scores, and IIEF-5 scores) were the risk factors of depression in men with PE. ","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: In this text, the usage of ""depression"" refers to a physiological response or a decrease in function—in this case, a temporary reduction in body weight and vitality observed in mice after viral infection.

80,Depression,"Eight depressed patients received 150 mg of clomipramine for 4 weeks. They completed the Profile of Mood States five to seven times the first week of treatment and five to seven times at the end of treatment. Moods showing significant decrease from the beginning to the end of the first week were: tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, and confusion. The only changes from the beginning to the end of the 4-week period were an increase in vigor and a decrease in fatigue. The occurrence of rapid and slow mood changes with antidepressants suggested that the former were due to sedative effects and the latter occurred at the rate of the improvement in the disease depression.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used group of antidepressants (ADs) with reported potential detrimental effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. Here, a comprehensive review of the in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies to date was carried out using the medical search engines MEDLINE (1950 to September 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2010). Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been identified on osteoclast, osteoblast and osteocyte cell lines. The effect of SSRIs on bone formation and resorption appears to be governed by the activation of a number of 5-HT receptors on osteoblasts and osteoclasts via endocrine, autocrine/paracrine and neuronal pathways. In vitro, in vivo and clinical collective data appears to indicate that SSRIs have a negative effect on bone at the therapeutic dose levels widely used for the treatment of depression in current clinical practice. Caution may therefore have to be employed with the use of SSRIs in patients at an increased risk of falls and osteoporosis. Further studies are needed in order to fully elicit the role of SSRIs in bone formation and their effects in the low oestrogen state.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Describes the use of clomipramine in treating depressed patients, focusing on its direct effects on mood states like depression, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, and fatigue. The context clearly pinpoints 'depression' as a psychological condition characterized by mood disturbances, treated pharmacologically.
- Text B: Discusses the impact of SSRIs, another class of antidepressants, on bone mineral density and fracture risks among patients treated for depression. While the primary discussion is about the side effects in a physiological context (bone health), it still acknowledges 'depression' as a mental health condition that is treated with these drugs.

### Label: Unchanged
### Reason:
Both texts utilize the term 'depression' within the realm of mental health, although the contexts broaden to include associated physiological effects in the later text. In Text A, 'depression' refers explicitly to a mood state directly treated by antidepressants, while in Text B, despite discussing physical side effects, it still fundamentally treats 'depression' as a psychological disorder cured with medications. There has been no significant semantic drift in the core meaning of the word 'depression' between these texts, maintaining its identification as a mental health condition."
81,Depression,"In healthy subjects, functionally appropriate modulation of short latency leg muscle reflexes occurs during gait. This modulation has been ascribed, in part, to changes in presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. The changes in modulation of quadriceps tendon jerk reflexes during gait of healthy subjects were compared with those of hemi- or paraparetic spastic patients. The spasticity was due to unilateral cerebral infarction or traumatic spinal cord injury, respectively. The modulation of the quadriceps femoris tendon jerk reflex at 16 phases of the step cycle was studied. The reflex responses obtained during treadmill walking were compared with control values obtained during gait-mimicking standing postures with corresponding levels of voluntary muscle contraction and knee angles. In healthy subjects the size of the reflexes was profoundly modulated and was generally depressed throughout the step cycle. In patients with spinal lesion the reflex depression during gait was almost removed and was associated with weak or no modulation during the step cycle. In patients with cerebral lesion there was less depression of the reflex size associated with a reduced reflex modulation on the affected side compared with healthy subjects. On the 'unaffected' side of these patients reflex modulation was similar to that of healthy subjects, but the reflex size during gait was not significantly different from standing control values. These observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the depression of reflex size and the modulation normally seen during gait in healthy subjects are impaired to different extents in spasticity of spinal or cerebral origin, possibly due to the unilateral preservation of fibre tracts in hemiparesis.","Few Korean studies have explored factors that influence depressive symptoms, a condition that is likely to increase with age. This study examines how worries, psychosocial resources, specifically family support, are related to depressive symptoms among a sample of the oldest old in South Korea. The buffering effects of psychosocial resources previously identified as reducing the impact of worries on depression in the younger old age group were also examined.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The term 'depression' in Text A is used in a physiological context referring specifically to the decrease or suppression of reflex responses during gait in individuals. The focus is on the diminished reflex activity, denoted by the term ""depressed reflex size"" when discussing muscle behavior and neurological responses during physical activity, particularly in individuals with certain neurological damages.
- Text B: In Text B, 'depression' is used in a psychological context, referring to the mental health condition characterized by feelings of severe despondency and dejection. The text examines factors influencing depressive symptoms, particularly among the elderly, and assesses the impact of psychosocial resources like family support on these symptoms.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: There is a significant shift in the context and connotation of the term 'depression' between the two texts.

84,Depression,"This study investigated the association between the severity and duration of physical disability and sexual esteem, sexual depression, sexual satisfaction, and the frequency of sexual behavior. A total of 1,196 participants completed the study. There were 748 participants (367 males, 381 females) who had a physical disability and 448 participants (171 males, 277 females) who were able-bodied. The age range of participants was 18-69 years, with a mean age of 36.39 years (SD = 10.41). The results demonstrated that people with more severe physical impairments experienced significantly lower levels of sexual esteem and sexual satisfaction and significantly higher levels of sexual depression than people who had mild impairments or who did not report having a physical impairment. The study also found that people with more severe physical disabilities engaged in mutual sexual activity significantly less frequently. Women with physical disabilities had significantly more positive feelings about their sexuality and significantly more frequent mutual sexual experiences than their male counterparts. For people with physical disabilities, the frequency of oral sex and nude cuddling were significant predictors of sexual satisfaction in men, while the frequency of deep kissing predicted sexual satisfaction in women. Furthermore, the viewing of erotica was significantly related to sexual dissatisfaction in men. Finally, it was found that people who had experienced their physical impairment for a longer period of time reported significantly more positive feelings about their sexuality. Implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions are made for future research.","Cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression have been described in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

85,Depression,Kinetic 1D simulations reveal that a weak density depression in a current-carrying plasma can lead to the formation of a strong potential ramp (double layer). The ramp and plasma turbulence it creates share many features with recent particle and field measurements in the auroral ionosphere. An electron beam accelerated by the ramp produces a series of propagating electron phase-space holes via a spatial two-stream instability. Electron heating associated with the formation and merging of these holes is found to influence the subsequent evolution of the potential ramp.,"Depression symptom severity, the most commonly studied outcome in antidepressant treatment trials, accounts for only a small portion of burden related to major depression.

86,Depression,"We investigated the predictive effect of psychological defenses on the course of major depression in a subsample of psychiatric patients from a larger study. We tested the hypothesis that a group of eight defenses, associated with depression in previous research, would predict, outcome of major depression. After an intake interview, 37 patients were rated on all DSM-III-R Axes, the SCL-90-R, and 28 defenses, using the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales. At 6-month follow-up interview, SCL-90-R and Global Assessment and Functioning (GAF) were redetermined on 34 (92%), 16 of whom had major depression at intake. Overall Defensive Functioning (ODF) significantly predicted GAF at 6-month follow-up over and above initial level of global functioning and presence of a personality disorder. The group of eight defenses were identified more often (p = .068) in depressed patients who improved less than predicted by their initial functional status. The high adaptive level defense, self-observation, was identified more often in those who improved more than predicted by their initial status. Our findings support the theory of a hierarchy of defenses, and the mediating effects of specific low and high adaptive level defenses on the course of a major depressive episode. Further research should examine passive aggression, acting out, help-rejecting complaining, splitting of self-images, splitting of others' images, projective identification, projection, and devaluation in relationship to the onset, course, and treatment response of depressive disorders.","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has caused discrimination and social stigma among healthcare workers (HCW) causing psychological problems due to prolonged work shifts, uncertain pay, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), added fear of infection to self or family, and so on.

Materials and methods Anxiety and depression were assessed using standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Data for the survey were collected from January 10, 2021, to February 6, 2021, and analyzed using Stata 15 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). Results A total of 213 participants were enrolled in the study from different parts of Nepal and their mean age was 29.90±6.43 years. The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers was 46.95% and 41.31%, respectively. A bidirectional relationship was present between GAD-7 and PHQ-9 score interpretation. About 57% of HCW experienced some form of perceived stigmatization due to COVID-19. Frontline HCW were six times more likely to be stigmatized compared to non-front line HCWs and diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with three times higher odds of facing perceived stigmatization. Conclusion A significant number of HCW experienced symptoms of anxiety and depression during the later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline HCW who were infected experienced a higher level of stigma.","### Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The usage of ""depression"" in Text A revolves around the psychiatric condition, major depression, and more specifically in the context of analyzing psychological defenses and their predictive value for the course of major depression disorder. The focus is on a clinical, medical understanding and diagnosis of depression as a mental health issue.
- Text B: In Text B, ""depression"" is used in the context of assessing mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to evaluate levels of depression. The term still retains its medical and psychological connotation, focusing on depression as a clinical condition.

- Label: **Unchanged**
  
- Reason: In both Text A and Text B, the term ""depression"" maintains its use as a clinical and psychological condition. Despite the different contexts – a study specifically focused on mental disorders' dynamics in Text A and a survey of mental health status among healthcare workers in a pandemic in Text B – the core meaning referring to a psychiatric condition remains consistent. There is no indication of a semantic drift in the use of the word ""depression"" between these two texts, as it still pertains to mental health in a medical setting."
87,Depression,"Depression during adolescence has been associated with a number of factors, including failure to individuate (Blos, 1968), insecure attachments (Armsden, McCauley, Greenberg, Burke, & Mitchell, 1990), negative parental representations, and object relations that lack self-other differentiation (Blatt, Wein, Chevron, & Quinlan, 1979). The present study examined factors associated with symptoms of depression in 59 nonclinical female adolescents. Specifically, the relationship between a number of theoretically related measures-separation-individuation, interpersonal concerns, self-critical concerns, attachment style, parental representations-and symptoms of depression was investigated. The model developed was able to explain the interrelationships of the variables involved in the psychological process of adolescence, and their demonstrated ability to predict symptoms of depression in normal female adolescents.","For 2.5 years we have been facing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its health, social and economic effects. One of its known consequences is the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression. However, reports of manic episodes related to COVID-19 have emerged. Mania is an integral part of the debilitating illness-bipolar disorder (BD). Due to its devastating effects, it is therefore important to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is a causative agent of this severe mental disorder. In this narrative review, we discuss the similarities between the disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2 and those found in patients with BD, and we also try to answer the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a risk factor for the development of this affective disorder. Our observation shows that disorders in COVID-19 showing the greatest similarity to those in BD are cytokine disorders, tryptophan metabolism, sleep disorders and structural changes in the central nervous system (CNS). These changes, especially intensified in severe infections, may be a trigger for the development of BD in particularly vulnerable people, e.g., with family history, or cause an acute episode in patients with a pre-existing BD.","### Answer:

88,Depression,"The psychometric characteristics of the Self-Report Depression Questionnaire (SRDQ, Reynolds, in press a), a 32-item self-report measure of depressive symptomatology in persons with mental retardation, were examined. The SRDQ was orally administered to 89 adults living in community-based settings. An internal consistency reliability coefficient of .90, and an 11-week test-retest reliability of .63 were obtained. Criterion-related validity was demonstrated by a high degree of relationship, r = .67, p less than .001, between the SRDQ and individual clinical interviews using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. An exploratory factor analysis of the SRDQ items was also presented.","Opioid receptors are widely distributed throughout the brain and play an essential role in modulating aspects of human mood, reward, and well-being. Accumulating evidence indicates the endogenous opioid system is dysregulated in depression and that pharmacological modulators of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors hold potential for the treatment of depression. Here we review animal and clinical data, highlighting evidence to support: dysregulation of the opioid system in depression, evidence for opioidergic modulation of behavioural processes and brain regions associated with depression, and evidence for opioidergic modulation in antidepressant responses. We evaluate clinical trials that have examined the safety and efficacy of opioidergic agents in depression and consider how the opioid system may be involved in the effects of other treatments, including ketamine, that are currently understood to exert antidepressant effects through non-opioidergic actions. Finally, we explore key neurochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of opioid system engagement, that together provides a rationale for further investigation into this relevant target in the treatment of depression.","- Target word: Depression
- Label: Changed
- Reason:
  The usage of the target word ""depression"" in the two texts spans different contexts. In Text A, ""depression"" refers to a clinical mental health condition characterized by symptoms such as prolonged sadness, anhedonia, and other emotional and functional impairments, which is being quantified and analyzed through a psychological questionnaire specifically tailored for individuals with mental retardation. This framing presents ""depression"" as a psychiatric diagnosis and focuses on symptom assessment and validation of a measurement tool. 

  In Text B, however, the word ""depression"" is used in discussing its biological and pharmacological aspects, particularly the involvement of the opioid system in mood regulation and depression treatments. This shifts the context of ""depression"" to a more biochemical and therapeutic perspective, exploring not just the clinical symptoms but the underlying neurochemical mechanics and potential new treatment avenues involving opioid receptors. 

  The significant shift from a clinical-psychological context in Text A to a neurobiological and treatment-focused discussion in Text B suggests a semantic drift from purely diagnostic and descriptive usage towards complex, intervention-based biomedical research in the field of depression. This indicates a broadening of the term's application in medical discourse, confirming a change in its usage over time."
89,Depression,"The majority of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) recover fairly quickly and are usually restored to their previous level of functioning. However, a significant minority have prolonged, complicated, or incomplete recoveries and have outcomes disproportionately worse than would have been predicted by the objective facts of the injury. This failure to recover as expected was the focus of this study. The participants were 80 adults with actual or suspected mild TBI who were referred to an outpatient mild TBI clinic. Most were characterized by problematic recoveries. The results indicated that those individuals who only had brain injuries made good recoveries, but that those with psychiatric comorbidity did not (chi(2) = 19.65, p = 0.0002). Most of the new psychiatric conditions responsible for poor recovery consisted of depression, anxiety disorders or conversion disorder. Dissociative phenomena appeared common after mild TBI and scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale predicted brain injury outcome with 77% accuracy.","This study investigated the knowledge of depression and preference for professional help, medications and treatment methods among Australians of Chinese-speaking background, and the perceptions of this population of the causes of mental illness.","### Answer:
- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Here ""depression"" is primarily used in the context of mental health as a psychiatric condition that negatively impacts the recovery outcomes of individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). The usage indicates a psychological disorder categorized alongside anxiety and conversion disorders that affect the emotional and psychological well-being of an individual.
- Text B: In this context, ""depression"" is also clearly related to mental health and examines cultural perceptions and knowledge about the condition among a specific demographic. The reference to depression pertains to understanding and treating it in a community health perspective.

- Label: Unchanged
- Reason: In both texts, the term ""depression"" continues to describe a mental health condition characterized by a disturbed emotional state that affects individuals' lives and well-being. Although the specific focus and surrounding context differ (clinical recovery from TBI in Text A and community health perception in Text B), the core meaning of ""depression"" as a psychological state has not shifted. Thus, there is no significant semantic drift in the way ""depression"" is used between the texts from the different years."
90,Depression,"In looking at the findings of the women subjects of this investigation, alcohol consumption decreased rapidly in younger women with the borderline being roughly at the age of 50 years. This is consistent with general trends in Japan. In terms of the correlation with personality, the proportion of drinkers in those groups consisting of syntonic, self-revelation, nervous and persistent personality types was high at 34-37%. 3 out of the 7 women who were severe problem drinkers were of the persistent personality type. As such, it is believed that depression contributes to problem drinking in middle-aged and elderly women residing in rural communities. According to the results of this investigation focused on women residing in rural communities, 30% of the severe problem drinkers were also suffering from depression. As this figure closely resembles the proportion noted in clinical investigations, it was suggested that in the process of alcoholism becoming involved with health care institutions, there are other contributing factors besides clinical depression.","Inbreeding depression is one of the leading factors preventing the evolution of self-fertilization in plants. In populations where self-fertilization evolves, theory suggests that natural selection against partially recessive deleterious alleles will reduce inbreeding depression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in self-incompatible and self-compatible populations of Leavenworthia alabamica. Within-population crosses were conducted to compare the quantity and quality of offspring produced by outcrossing and self-fertilization. These progeny were grown in a common greenhouse and inbreeding depression was measured in germination, survival, biomass, transition rate to flowering, flower number, petal length, pollen grains/anther, pollen viability, and ovule number. In comparison to outcrossing, self-fertilization led to the production of fewer and smaller seeds within self-incompatible populations. Moreover, inbreeding depression was observed in eight of 11 offspring traits within self-incompatible populations of L. alabamica. In contrast, there was significant inbreeding depression only in flower number within self-compatible populations. The results of this study are consistent with the idea that self-fertilization selectively removes partially recessive deleterious alleles causing inbreeding depression in natural plant populations. However, in plant species such as L. alabamica where self-compatibility may evolve in small populations following long-distance dispersal, declines in inbreeding depression may also be facilitated by genetic drift.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: This text considers ""depression"" in the context of human mental health, specifically linking it to problem drinking among middle-aged and elderly women in rural communities. The meaning here pertains to a clinical or psychological state that can impact life and behaviors negatively, leading to outcomes such as substance abuse.
- Text B: Here, ""depression"" refers to ""inbreeding depression,"" a term from biology dealing with the reduced biological fitness in a population due to inbreeding, which often results in an increase in deleterious alleles. This application of the word is entirely distinct from the psychological context observed in Text A.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The usage of the word ""depression"" displays a significant semantic drift from discussing a mental health condition affecting humans in Text A to pointing to a genetic consequence affecting biological fitness in organisms (plants) in Text B. The contexts and implications in both uses are entirely different, marking a clear change in meaning."
91,Depression,The treatment of bipolar depression is a significant clinical problem that remains understudied. The role for antidepressant (AD) agents vs. mood stabilizers has been particularly problematic to ascertain.,"Recent evidence has revealed a contribution of glutamate in the stereotyped cholinergic neuromuscular transmission. Indeed, receptors, transporters and glutamate itself are present at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) while glutamate activation of metabotropic receptors (mGluRs) decreases synaptic transmission and mediates depression through presynaptic mechanisms. However, we have shown that the mGluRs are located postsynaptically, inconsistent with the presynaptic action of glutamate. In the present study, we tested whether nitric oxide (NO) serves as a retrograde messenger mediating the distant effect of glutamate. Glutamate or an mGluR agonist [trans-(1S,3R)-aminocyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD)] failed to reduce synaptic transmission in the presence of an NOS inhibitor (3Br7NINa, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole sodium salt). Moreover, application of 3Br7NINa precluded the effect of the mGluR antagonist MCPG [(S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine] on high-frequency-induced synaptic depression. Iontophoretic injections of BAPTA [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid] in muscle fibres abolished the effect of trans-ACPD on synaptic transmission and blocked the mGluR component of depression, indicating the involvement of muscular calcium in mGluR-induced depression. Also, the use of this protocol unveiled a muscular calcium-dependent potentiating pathway dependent on cyclo-oxygenase activity. In addition, local application of trans-ACPD induced an increase in NO production by muscle fibres visualized with the indicator DAF-FM (4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein). This was prevented by 3Br7NINa or the iontophoretic injection of BAPTA. Moreover, motor nerve stimulation (50 Hz, 30 s) induced an increase in DAF-FM fluorescence that was abolished by 3Br7NINa and MCPG. Hence, the data suggest that the production of the retrograde molecule NO depends on the postsynaptic calcium-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase following mGluRs stimulation and is essential for the glutamatergic modulation of synaptic efficacy and plasticity at the NMJ.","- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A (2000), the term ""depression"" is discussed within the context of a clinical condition, specifically bipolar depression, exploring the challenges associated with the treatment using antidepressants or mood stabilizers. The usage focuses on a mental health disorder characterized by mood swings including depressive episodes.

  In Text B (2020), the use of ""depression"" relates to a physiological effect on synaptic transmission in a study on neuromuscular junctions, where 'depression' denotes the decrease in synaptic efficacy mediated by specific neurochemical pathways, such as glutamate affecting metabotropic receptors. This usage of ""depression"" is distinctly different from the psychiatric context seen in Text A, referring instead to a functional reduction in biological activity rather than an affective disorder. 

  The semantic field of ""depression"" in the texts shifts from a mental health condition to a biological reaction at a synaptic level, indicating a considerable semantic drift in the usage of the word over the 20-year span between these texts."
92,Depression,"A study was made of the functional activity of natural killer cells (NK-cells), antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity of killer cells (K-cells) and the effect of interferon (alpha-IFN) in vitro on function of these cells in a group of donors and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) as well as in patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with DCMP might be divided into 3 groups according to the nature of NK- and K-cell functional activity: in a grave and rapid DCMP course the functional activity of NK- and K-cells was sharply decreased, a favorable course of disease was characterized by normal or raised values of their cytotoxicity. Patients with a severe type of DCMP revealed profound depression of lymphocyte killer activity.","The relationship between Islamic veiling, body dissatisfaction, and desire for cosmetic rhinoplasty (CR) has not been studied.

93,Depression,"Taste disturbance may cause subjective discomfort and impair appetite and food intake. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of perceived taste disturbance and analyze its association to age, gender, whole salivary flow rate, subjective oral dryness, burning mouth, medication, and psychological factors. Five hundred forty-seven men and 656 women aged 20 to 69 years were randomly selected from the Public Dental Health Service register in northern Sweden. Oral complaints were registered and whole salivary flow rate measured. Medication, anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed. Thirty individuals (2.5%), five men (0.9%) and 25 women (3.8%), reported perceived taste disturbances (distorted taste or loss of taste). In men, no individual with taste disturbance was found in the youngest and oldest age groups. The prevalence in the 30-39-year age group was 1.9% and in the 40-49-year group 1.8%. In women, one individual (1%) with taste disturbance was found in the youngest age group. In the 30-39-year group, the prevalence was 3.8%, increasing to 5.1% in the oldest age group. Illness, subjective oral dryness, state anxiety, perceived stress, depression, use of antiasthmatics, and trait anxiety were associated with taste disturbance. It was concluded that perceived taste disturbance might be an interaction of various health factors such as illness and mental condition.","Observational studies have shown that allergic infants, irrespective of the type of diet, show various degrees of growth depression in the first year of life. We investigated whether the type of milk in the complementary feeding period (6-12 months of age) is associated with differences in the increase of standardized growth indices (weight-for-age, WA; length-for-age, LA; and weight-for-length, WL, z-scores) in infants with cow's milk allergy (CMA). Infants with immunoglobulin E-mediated CMA breastfed at least 4 months and progressively weaned in the 5- to 6-month period were randomly assigned to three special formulas, a soy formula (n = 32), a casein hydrolysate (n = 31), and a rice hydrolysate (n = 30). A fourth, non-randomized group was made up by allergic infants still breastfed up to 12 months (n = 32). Groups were compared for WA, LA, and WL z-scores at 6, 9 and 12 months of age. All groups showed low WA and LA z-scores at 6 months of age. Infants fed hydrolyzed products showed a trend toward higher WA z-score increments in the 6- to 12-month period. The use of casein- and rice-based hydrolyzed formulas resulted in higher changes in WA compared with soy formula. Further research should be aimed at optimizing the dietary needs and feeding regimens for infants with CMA.","###Answer:

In Text A, ""depression"" is used to denote a clinical psychological disorder affecting mental health, whereas in Text B, ""depression"" refers to a decrease or suppression in physiological growth rates in infants, indicating a different semantic application unrelated to mental health. This demonstrates a significant semantic drift in the usage of the word ""depression"" from a mental health condition to a description of a physical condition relative to growth metrics."
94,Depression,"This study evaluated pharmaceutical charges and economic outcomes related to therapy with the three leading selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. Patient treatment episodes of major depression occurring between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1996 were included for analysis (patient age range, 18-64 yr). Results showed no significant differences among direct and related medical charges for fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Direct and related pharmaceutical charges were significantly lower for paroxetine and sertraline compared with fluoxetine. The higher drug charges observed for fluoxetine resulted in higher total treatment charges compared with paroxetine and sertraline.","Adolescence is a vulnerable developmental phase marked by physical, psychological, and social changes that rapidly expose young people to a wide range of new stressors. When differentiating between bipolar disorder and teenage ""acting out,"" a careful history is important. Adolescent bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by fluctuating episodes of mood elevation and depression that is frequently neither recognized nor formally diagnosed. Adolescents with bipolar disorder often manifest a more nonepisodic, chronic course with continuous rapid-cycling patterns than do adults. Pharmacologic treatment of adolescent bipolar disorder is difficult and often requires combination therapy to address comorbidities like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorder. Adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder can be beneficial. Psychosocial treatments include family education, enhanced parenting techniques, stress management, and the development of effective coping strategies.","- Target word: Depression

Though the contexts vary slightly (major depression vs. bipolar disorder's depressive phase), the core meaning of ""depression"" as a depressive mental state within diagnosed psychiatric conditions remains stable across both documents. Thus, the semantic meaning of ""depression"" in the context of mental health has not significantly drifted between these two uses."
95,Depression,"Examined the relationship among depression, locus of control of reinforcement, and age in 26 depressed, female, psychiatric outpatients, 26 nondepressed controls, and 55 undergraduate students (23 male, 32 female), of whom 18 were depressed. The mean age of the patients and controls was 40.2, and of the students 19.7. Depression (measured on the Beck Depression Inventory) and locus of control (measured on Rotter's Internal-External questionnaire) were correlated highly. Age was correlated negatively with locus of control scores and positively with depression. With age partialled out, the correlation between external locus of control and depression increased. The association between external locus of control is neither a single function of age nor a response to hospitalization because the depressed Ss in this study were outpatients. The possible causal relationship between external locus of control and depression is discussed.","Minimally invasive and arthroscopic procedures have become an integral part of orthopedics and arthroscopy of the knee in particular has extensively evolved during recent years.

96,Depression,"Age differences in the experience of chronic pain remain unclear. A serious barrier to progress in the field of pain and aging arises from the lack of data regarding the psychometric properties of pain scales for use with the elderly. The present study was designed to assess age differences in pain intensity and quality and to compare the psychometric properties of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) in young and elderly chronic pain patients. Young (n=139, mean age=42.93+/-9.41 years) and elderly (n=139, mean age=70.12+/-7.51 years) pain center patients, matched on primary diagnosis or pain location, duration, and sex, completed the MPQ, numeric ratings (0-10) of pain intensity, a Pain Map, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A Pain Management Index (PMI) score was calculated for each patient. Age differences on the measure of pain qualities were found. The elderly group had significantly lower MPQ total and sensory scores and chose fewer words than the young group. However, there were no significant differences between the groups on numeric ratings of highest, usual, and lowest pain intensity. Similarly, there were no age differences on PMI, Pain Map, or the HADS Depression or Anxiety Subscales. Finally, the latent structure, internal consistency, and pattern of subscale correlations of the MPQ were very similar in the young and elderly groups. Possible explanations for the discrepancy in the pattern of age differences on measures of pain intensity and quality are explored. The implications of this pattern of age differences for basic pain mechanisms and pain management should be given serious empirical attention.","Whether depressed patients with evidence of inflammation are more appropriate candidates for immunotherapies is being tested in several clinical trials, which are selecting patients based on elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammation-related symptoms.

  - In Text A, the word 'depression' is used in a physiological context to describe a reduced activity or function in a biological system, which in this case is related to breathing and muscle control due to chemical induction.
  - In Text B, 'depression' refers to the psychological state, a common mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities.
  - The semantic drift is evident as the term moves from a physiological description to a psychological and clinical disorder context. This indicates a significant shift in the usage and connotations of the word 'depression' from being about physiological responses in a non-human study context to a disease concept in humans with consideration of emotional, biological, and clinical aspects."
97,Depression,"This study was designed to assess whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril could potentiate the efficacy of a single dose of oral isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in patients with coronary artery disease. Fourteen men (mean age 53 years) with stable angina pectoris were studied. In each patient the efficacy of placebo, captopril (50 to 100 mg), ISDN (10 mg), and a combination of captopril (50 to 100 mg) and ISDN (10 mg) was assessed by repeated exercise treadmill tests performed before and 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after administration of a single dose. A single-blind, randomized technique was applied. According to the mean data in the whole group of 14 patients, captopril alone produced no improvement in exercise duration to the onset of angina and to angina of moderate severity compared with placebo. The magnitude of ST-segment depression did not significantly change after captopril administration. ISDN alone significantly increased exercise duration to onset of angina and to angina of moderate severity (antianginal effect) and decreased the magnitude of ST-segment depression (antiischemic effect) 1 to 3 hours after administration. Combined administration of ISDN and captopril resulted in more expressed antianginal and antiischemic effects; at 2, 3 and 6 hours these effects with ISDN plus captopril were significantly more pronounced than those with ISDN alone. According to individual data, the most marked potentiation of ISDN efficacy was observed in patients who had poor response to ISDN alone. In all 6 patients in whom ISDN alone was ineffective, after the addition of captopril the desired antianginal effect was obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","The current study examined neuropsychological changes over the course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in outpatients with major depressive disorder and the influence of cognitive deficits as predictors of clinical outcome in depression.

Small improvements were found in divided attention, figural memory, and processing speed from pre- to posttreatment. Cognitive deficits in executive functions before treatment predicted the clinical outcome at the end of CBT. The present study reveals that attention and memory deficits are most likely to improve over the course of treatment, whereas executive functions remain stable in the long term. Depressed patients with worse executive functions at the beginning of treatment seem to benefit more from long-term CBT therapy.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: This study concerns the efficacy of captopril and ISDN in treating angina using terms such as ""ST-segment depression."" Here, ""depression"" is used in a medical context specific to cardiology, describing a downward deflection in electrocardiography, which indicates ischemia or insufficient blood supply to the heart.
- Text B: This text examines the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on patients with major depressive disorder. ""Depression"" here refers to a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The target word ""depression"" in Text A pertains to a clinical symptom observed in electrocardiographic results related to heart function. In Text B, ""depression"" is used to refer to a psychological condition affecting mood and mental health. There is a significant semantic drift in the term's application from a physiological symptom in cardiology to a psychological mood disorder."
98,Depression,"ISDN (standard release formulation) 40 mg administered 6 times daily (= 240 mg) remained effective during a 4-week treatment of patients with stable angina in terms of decreasing anginal attacks and reducing ischemic ST segment depression at stress testing in the upright position (step climbing test). The sustained antianginal activity is explained by fluctuating plasma levels, provided by rapid drug release from the standard formulation, short administration intervals and an 7-hour-night pause. When comparing acute and chronic antianginal activity of ISDN (40 mg) administered 4 times daily with regard to the type of stress testing it became evident that a marked attenuation of antiischemic activity (-35%; p less than 0.01) occurred in the supine (bicycle ergometry) but not in the upright (step climbing test) position. The most probable explanation for the significant attenuation of efficacy in the supine position is marked blood redistribution into central compartments with increase of cardiac filling pressures during chronic therapy. Rapid development of tolerance both to the hemodynamic and antiischemic effects of glycerol trinitrate within 24 hours could be shown during intravenous administration (3 mg/h) in patients with stable angina. It is concluded that the antiischemic effects of oral ISDN (standard release formulation) administered 4-6 times daily is preserved during long-term therapy due to fluctuating plasma levels. Nitrate therapy providing constant doses over time (e.g. I.V. nitroglycerin) leads to a rapid attenuation of efficacy most probably due to counter regulatory mechanisms.",Major depression occurs in 4.4% to 20% of the general population. Studies suggest that major depression is accompanied by immune dysregulation and activation of the inflammatory response system (IRS). Our objective was to quantitatively summarize the data on concentrations of specific cytokines in patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode and controls.,"- Target word: Depression
- Text A: Discusses ""depression"" in the context of reducing ischemic issues during stress tests for patients with stable angina. The term ""depression"" here refers to a decrease in the electrical activity shown on the stress test, indicating reduced function or activity in a specific area.
- Text B: Describes ""depression"" as a psychiatric disorder characterized by mood disturbances, citing immune dysregulation and inflammatory responses as associated factors. Here, ""depression"" specifically refers to major depressive disorder—a substantial alteration of mood and psychological function.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: In Text A, ""depression"" refers to the physiological decrease in function specifically in an ischemic context, while in Text B, it directly refers to a psychological disorder with systemic biological implications, such as immune system involvement. This indicates a significant shift in the use of the word from a physiological symptom in a specific context to a broader, well-defined medical condition concerning mental health."
99,Depression,"A recent paper by Barclay and Kent (1998) raised various issues with regards to motherhood and recent immigration. They expressed reservations with conceptualizing extreme misery in new mothers as depression, and with screening for postnatal distress in women from non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESB). They argued that a common self-report measure for postnatal distress screening, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), was flawed. They also argued that the concept of postnatal depression implies a medical aetiology and, thus, fails to recognise the socio-cultural aspects experienced by NESB women. We address these issues, by demonstrating that the EPDS is not flawed, and by arguing that screening for postpartum distress results in more NESB women being identified and, consequently, offered a service, than if such screening does not occur. We also disagree with the view that the term 'postnatal depression' necessarily implies any aetiology, and that work by our unit, as well as others around the world, indicates that the psychosocial and cultural aspects related to distress in new immigrant mothers is being recognised and acted upon.","Chronic periodontitis (CP) seems to be associated with stress and depression, but little information on this possible association is available in the literature. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the association among stress, the salivary cortisol level (SCL), and CP.","- Target word: Depression
- Text A: The text discusses postnatal depression, particularly in the context of socio-cultural challenges faced by new immigrant mothers from non-English-speaking backgrounds. The term is used in a psychiatric and psychological context, emphasizing the emotional and mental health state specifically associated with the postpartum period.
- Text B: Here, the term ""depression"" is linked to a biological and psychosomatic reaction involving stress and the potential effects on chronic periodontitis. The usage implies a broader, more general mental health condition affecting physical health, moving beyond the specific postpartum context.

- Label: Changed
- Reason: The usage of ""depression"" in Text A specifically relates to a mental health condition in the postnatal phase, characterized by emotional distress influenced by cultural and social factors. In Text B, the term ""depression"" is used more generally in reference to mental health affecting physical conditions like chronic periodontitis. The shift from a specific postnatal mental health focus to a general mental health perspective that impacts physical health indicates a semantic drift in the usage of ""depression"" across these texts."
