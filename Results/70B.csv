    ###Answer
     Label: Changed
     Explanation: In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" refers to a physical ability to perform tasks, specifically in the context of a medical evaluation. In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" has a different meaning, referring to a cognitive skill related to the cerebellum. This shift in meaning between the two sentences indicates semantic drift."
1,Dexterity,"We studied 26 patients in a double-blind investigation to compare psychomotor and cognitive recovery for 30 h after sedation for day-case gastroscopy with i.v. diazepam 0.15 mg kg-1 or midazolam 0.07 mg kg-1.

Compared with baseline, the midazolam group was significantly impaired in critical flicker fusion threshold, reaction time, dexterity and visualization tasks up to 4 h after administration (P less than 0.05).

    ###Answer
     Label: Changed
    Reasoning:
    The word ""dexterity"" in Sentence A refers to a cognitive ability (i.e., visualization tasks) and a physical ability (i.e., reaction time, dexterity) related to motor skills. In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to perform fine motor movements, specifically grasping, pinching, and releasing objects, and the ability to perform activities of daily living.
    Between the two sentences, the meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted from a broader range of cognitive and physical abilities to a more specific set of fine motor skills. This change in meaning indicates semantic drift, so the label is ""Changed."""

    ###Answer
     Label: Changed
    Reasoning:
    The word ""dexterity"" in Sentence A refers to the physical skill or ability to perform a task that requires manual dexterity, such as dispensing gel into tubes. In Sentence B, the word ""dexterous"" refers to the ability of a robotic hand to perform tasks that require dexterity, such as grasping objects. The meaning of the word has shifted from referring to a physical skill to referring to a capability of a robotic device. Therefore, the label is ""Changed""."
3,Dexterity,"The effects of a new 1,4 benzodiazepine hypnotic, loprazolam (1.0 mg) and alcohol (0.7 g/kg body weight) were investigated over a 15 h period in eight healthy male medical students, in a placebo controlled balanced design. Loprazolam when given alone impaired performance on a manual dexterity task, on a test of mental arithmetic, on a tracking task and it impaired memory as judged by the name and address memory test. Given alone, alcohol impaired performance on the simple reaction time task and on the tracking task. Performance on the memory test and choice reaction time test actually improved. No evidence was found suggesting a potentiation of effect when loprazolam and alcohol were given together. However, (a) on the manual dexterity task the alcohol, having no effect on its own, alleviated the loprazolam-induced impairment. (b) In the tracking task both alcohol and loprazolam impaired performance when given alone but not when given together.

4,Dexterity,"The primary intent of this study was to determine if a hand glove could be designed on a criterion of selective protection. Force distribution patterns on the palmar side of hand were obtained from various studies to develop zones of hand that needed protection. A new design for gloves was developed based on the principle of selective protection, where protective material is introduced in varying levels over different parts of the glove, in order to provide protection where it is most needed, and at the same time preserve the desirable dexterity and strength capabilities of the barehand, optimizing the trade-off between protection and performance. Two pairs of prototype gloves incorporating different levels of protection were fabricated and tested using a battery of performance tests and an algometer test for pressure sensitivity. The test battery comprising four dexterity tasks and a maximal voluntary grip strength task was used to assess a number of glove conditions, including the two prototype gloves developed. The results indicate that the performance of the prototype gloves are comparable, and that the performance times for the double glove and the two prototype gloves tested were not significantly different. For the grip strength, the two prototype gloves were better than the double glove. The assembly task performance for the prototype II (laminar glove) was significantly lower than that of the other glove types tested. It appears that gloves of variable thickness can be developed to afford adequate protection at zones of most need. Glove manufacturers are recommended to use an ergonomic approach in the design of gloves. Such an approach, besides protecting the safety objective of gloves, could enhance productivity considerably.","Hand function plays a critical role in how we interact with our physical environment. Hand motor impairments in children can compromise many facets of their daily life including physical independence and social interactions.

    ###Answer
     Label: Changed
    Explanation:
    The meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has shifted between the two sentences. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. In Sentence B, ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to perform a variety of hand movements, including grasping and manipulating objects. The shift in meaning is significant because it goes from referring to a specific set of hand movements to a broader range of movements. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

This conclusion is questionable in that the intellectual skills necessary for performance on the cognitive development tests are probably not functionally lateralized. In addition, when the influence of chronological age is partialled out, there is no residual correlation between lateralization of manual dexterity and cognitive performance.","Human hand signifies a magnificent and challenging example for scientists and engineers trying to replicate its complex structure and functionality.
