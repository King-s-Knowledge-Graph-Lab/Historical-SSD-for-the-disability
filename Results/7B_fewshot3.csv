0,Dexterity,"Loss of sensory function is a severe impairment for the hand which loses a lot of its dexterity, becomes ""blind"" if not guided by sight and is susceptible to burns, wounds and infections. Nerve repair by sutures or grafts is the preeminent operation if the condition of the skin is good. When skin is damaged, various sensory flaps (both free microvascular and local pedicle) may be used. Island flaps from the pulp of another digit give inconsistent results. Sensory flaps from the back of the index finger to the thumb give a fair two-point discrimination. Free microvascular flaps from the pulp or the web of the hallux or from two or even three toes are safe and good operations which restore both perfect skin coverage and excellent sensory function with good two-point discrimination. The damage at the donor site is well tolerated. When previous operations have covered the digit or the hand by means of non-sensory skin, direct neurotization of this skin is possible. Research has been done in animals showing the formation of free endings inside the neurotized skin. Rehabilitation of the previously existing sensory corpuscles is even possible. Our series includes 12 island flaps from the pulp, 19 pedicle flaps from the dorsum, 17 homodigital reverse flow flaps, 38 different types of free neurovascular flaps from the foot and 3 direct sensory neurotization.","Brain lesions may disturb hand functioning in children with cerebral palsy (CP), making it difficult or even impossible for them to perform several manual activities. Most conventional treatments for hand dysfunction in CP assume that reducing the hand dysfunctions will improve the capacity to manage activities (i.e., manual ability, MA). The aim of this study was to investigate the directional relationships (direct and indirect pathways) through which hand skills influence MA in children with CP. A total of 136 children with CP (mean age: 10 years; range: 6-16 years; 35 quadriplegics, 24 diplegics, 77 hemiplegics) were assessed. Six hand skills were measured on both hands: touch-pressure detection (Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer), stereognosis (Manual Form Perception Test), proprioception (passive mobilization of the metacarpophalangeal joints), grip strength (GS) (Jamar dynamometer), gross manual dexterity (GMD) (Box and Block Test), and fine finger dexterity (Purdue Pegboard Test). MA was measured with the ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire. Correlation coefficients were used to determine the linear associations between observed variables. A path analysis of structural equation modeling was applied to test different models of causal relationships among the observed variables. Purely sensory impairments did seem not to play a significant role in the capacity to perform manual activities. According to path analysis, GMD in both hands and stereognosis in the dominant hand were directly related to MA, whereas GS was indirectly related to MA through its relationship with GMD. However, one-third of the variance in MA measures could not be explained by hand skills. It can be concluded that MA is not simply the integration of hand skills in daily activities and should be treated per se, supporting activity-based interventions. ","###Task: Identify semantic drift in a target word by comparing its usage in two texts from different time periods.

        ###Instructions:
        - You will be provided with a target word and two texts, each from different years (e.g., Text A from 2000 and Text B from 2020).
        - Examine how the target word is used in each text, considering the context and its meaning.
        - Decide whether the target word has undergone a significant change in meaning or connotation between the two periods.
        - Label the semantic drift as ""Changed"" if there is a significant shift in meaning, or ""Unchanged"" if the meaning is similar.
        - Justify your label briefly.


        ###Examples:
        ####Example-1
        - Target word: Dyslexia
        - Text A: The authors report findings in a 67-year-old right-handed man who had an ischemic infarct in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery. The clinical manifestation consisted mainly of total alexia without agraphia. The patient gradually recovered, subsequently showing the syndrome of spelling dyslexia. Cerebral MR-images revealed a circumscript infarction of medial and basal parts of left temporal lobe. In the acute stage [99mTc]HM-PAO SPECT was characterized by a diminished uptake in the definitely infarcted area and hyperfixation in the region of the left forceps major. Because high retention of HM-PAO indicates potentially salvageable tissue after an ischemic event, the depicted area might be correlated with the recovery of function. Thus, the authors' neuroimaging data give further support to the assumption that the left forceps major is a critical area for global alexia, whereas spelling dyslexia is due to involvement of the left medio-basal temporal lobe.
        - Text B: We enrolled pediatric subjects with developmental dyslexia and, as a control group, healthy age- and sex-matched subjects without developmental dyslexia. Thyroid function was evaluated in subjects with developmental dyslexia measuring serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4). Thyroid autoimmunity was evaluated in all subjects measuring antithyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) and antithyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies. In subjects with developmental dyslexia, thyroid ultrasonography (US) was also performed.

        ####Example-2
        - Target word: Depression
        - Text A: Microinjections of carbachol into the pons induce a state that resembles rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in intact cats and, in decerebrate, artificially ventilated cats, produce postural atonia accompanied by a powerful depression of the respiratory motor output. In this study, pontine carbachol was used in decerebrate, spontaneously breathing cats to assess the effects of mechanical and chemical respiratory reflexes on the magnitude and pattern of the carbachol-induced depression of breathing, and to determine whether the depression is altered in those animals in which rapid eye movements are present. Phrenic nerve activity and tidal volume were only transiently depressed at the onset of the carbachol-induced postural atonia, whereas the decrease in respiratory rate and the depressions of hypoglossal and intercostal activities persisted until the response was reversed by a pontine microinjection of atropine 15-101 minutes after the onset of carbachol response. Ventilation was reduced to 70% of control during the steady-state conditions. The irregularity of breathing, characterized by the inter-quartile ranges of the distributions of the peak phrenic nerve activity and respiratory timing, did not increase following pontine carbachol. Neither vagotomy nor vigorous eye movements were associated with increased breathing irregularity. This contrasts with the irregular breathing (with minor average changes in ventilation) typical of natural REM sleep. We propose that the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat provides a useful model of the depressant effects that neural events associated with REM sleep may have on breathing.
        - Text B: New frontiers for host-microbe interactions continue to emerge as our knowledge of the adult gut microbiome in health and disease is continually supplemented and improved. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are now linked to symptom severity while population-based evidence linking gut microbiome signatures to depression is an important new landmark. The effects of drugs on gut microbiome composition are also becoming clearer. Meanwhile, preclinical studies have delineated the influence of the gut microbiome at a structural and activity level in distinct brain regions. Bacterial metabolites, such as tryptamine, can activate specific receptors to impact gastrointestinal motility. These recent studies bring into focus the future implications for therapeutic targeting of the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

1,Dexterity,"Neurophysiological and psychological tests were administered to 107 patients--48 men and 59 women--with a diagnosis of solvent poisoning after longstanding (mean 9.6 years for males and mean 7.6 years for females) occupational exposure. Electroencephalography (EEG) and a wide psychological test battery were applied in all cases, and electroneurographic measurements were performed in 77 subjects. Sixty-five percent of the patients showed an abnormal EEG, and excessive beta activity, not induced by drugs, was found in 54% of patients. At least one abnormally slow nerve conduction velocity (CV) was found in 48 out of 77 patients. The scores of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) subtests Digit Span (DSp) and Digit Symbol (DSy) among the men and scores of Similarities (Sim), Digit Symbol (DSy), Picture Completion (PC), and Block Design (BD) among the women were statistically significantly lower than in the Finnish standardization sample. Long duration of exposure was related to poor performance in the Santa Ana Dexterity test in both sexes, to poor visual memory among the men and to poor visuoconstructive intellectual tasks among the women. The background frequency in the EEG showed a correlation to the DSp test of WAIS and some relationship emerged also between the former and the BD, the Symmetry Drawing test, the Santa Ana Dexterity test, and the Mira test. Focal slow wave abnormalities were related to inaccurate hand movements in the psychomotor Mira test. Neurophysiological and psychological tests seem to reflect partly different aspects of neurologic effects and their combined use helps in the evaluation of hazards of solvent exposure.","  The hand is one of the most complex and important parts of the human body.
The dexterity provided by its multiple degrees of freedom enables us to perform
many of the tasks of daily living which involve grasping and manipulating
objects of interest. Contemporary prosthetic devices for people with
transradial amputations or wrist disarticulation vary in complexity, from
passive prosthetics to complex devices that are body or electrically driven.
One of the important challenges in developing smart prosthetic hands is to
create devices which are able to mimic all activities that a person might
perform and address the needs of a wide variety of users. The approach explored
here is to develop algorithms that permit a device to adapt its behavior to the
preferences of the operator through interactions with the wearer. This device
uses multiple sensing modalities including muscle activity from a myoelectric
armband, visual information from an on-board camera, tactile input through a
touchscreen interface, and speech input from an embedded microphone. Presented

2,Dexterity,"The aim of this study was to extend the understanding of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) into adulthood. We recruited 19 adults aged between 18 and 65 who had received diagnoses of DCD or dyspraxia or who self-reported as having motor impairments consistent with a history of DCD, together with age- and gender-matched controls. Participants were given tests of manual dexterity, handwriting, construction, obstacle avoidance, dynamic balance, static balance, dual task performance, ball skills, reaction time, movement time and sequencing. As a group, adults with DCD performed more poorly than controls across all tasks. Slowness and variability of movement was a pervasive feature of their performance and many individuals had considerable problems with sequencing and with dual task performance. A discriminant function analysis conducted using six performance measures correctly classified participants as car drivers or non-drivers. Adults do retain motor difficulties and these can exclude them from important activities of daily living.","In recent decades, gaming technology has been accepted as a feasible method for complementing traditional clinical practice, especially in neurorehabilitation; however, the viability of using 3D Virtual Reality (VR) for the assessment of upper limb motor function has not been fully explored. For that purpose, we developed a VR-based version of the Box and Blocks Test (BBT), a clinical test for the assessment of manual dexterity, as an automated alternative to the classical procedure. Our VR-based BBT (VR-BBT) integrates the traditional BBT mechanics into gameplay using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) to capture the user's hand motion and the Oculus Rift headset to provide a fully immersive experience. This paper focuses on evaluating the validity of our VR-BBT to reliably measure the manual dexterity in a sample of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). For this study, a group of twenty individuals in a mild to moderate stage of PD were recruited. Participants were asked to perform the physical BBT (once) and our proposed VR-BBT (twice) system, separately. Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the VR-BBT significantly correlated with the conventional assessment of the BBT. The VR-BBT scores have shown a significant association with PD severity measured by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. This fact suggests that the VR-BBT could be used as a reliable indicator for health improvements in patients with PD.

In Text A, the focus is on adults with a history of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), while Text B explores the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in assessing manual dexterity, specifically in patients with Parkinson's Disease. The first text emphasizes the persistence of motor difficulties in adulthood due to DCD, while the second text investigates a technological application to evaluate and potentially improve motor skills.

3,Dexterity,"The appropriate suspension system results in a safe and well functioning lower extremity prosthesis. Residual limb length, joint ligament stability, and limb volume determine suspension methods as does activity level, dexterity, success of previous suspension, and cosmetic requirements. The supracondylar suspension cuff, prosthetic sleeves, and gel liners with locking mechanisms generally are indicated for the average to long transtibial amputation level. Short limbs are better fitted with supracondylar and suprapatellar suspension. Waist belts generally are indicated for patients with new amputations or those with vascular compromise. Suction suspension is the most desirable form of transfemoral suspension and is recommended for most standard to long residual limbs. Roll on silicone liners with or without locking pins and the hyperbaric sock offer the patient systems that are easier to don yet still provide unencumbered suspension. The total elastic suspension belt offers excellent auxiliary suspension and can be applied to the prosthesis by the patient. Multiple factors and patient preference should be considered when prescribing suspension systems for lower extremity prostheses.","  We define sound and adequate denotational and operational semantics for the
stochastic lambda calculus. These two semantic approaches build on previous
work that used similar techniques to reason about higher-order probabilistic
programs, but for the first time admit an adequacy theorem relating the
operational and denotational views. This resolves the main issue left open in
(Bacci et al. 2018).

        - You will be provided with a target word and two texts, each from different years (e.g., Text A from 2000 and Text B from 2020).
        - Examine how the target word is used in each text, considering the context and its meaning.
        - Decide whether the target word has undergone a significant change in meaning or connotation between the two periods.
        - Label the semantic drift as ""Changed"" if there is a significant shift in meaning, or ""Unchanged"" if the meaning is similar.
        - Justify your label briefly.


        ###Examples:
        ####Example-1
        - Target word: Dyslexia
        - Text A: The authors report findings in a 67-year-old right-handed man who had an ischemic infarct in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery. The clinical manifestation consisted mainly of total alexia without agraphia. The patient gradually recovered, subsequently showing the syndrome of spelling dyslexia. Cerebral MR-images revealed a circumscript infarction of medial and basal parts of left temporal lobe. In the acute stage [99mTc]HM-PAO SPECT was characterized by a diminished uptake in the definitely infarcted area and hyperfixation in the region of the left forceps major. Because high retention of HM-PAO indicates potentially salvageable tissue after an ischemic event, the depicted area might be correlated with the recovery of function. Thus, the authors' neuroimaging data give further support to the assumption that the left forceps major is a critical area for global alexia, whereas spelling dyslexia is due to involvement of the left medio-basal temporal lobe.
        - Text B: We enrolled pediatric subjects with developmental dyslexia and, as a control group, healthy age- and sex-matched subjects without developmental dyslexia. Thyroid function was evaluated in subjects with developmental dyslexia measuring serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4). Thyroid autoimmunity was evaluated in all subjects measuring antithyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) and antithyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies. In subjects with developmental dyslexia, thyroid ultrasonography (US) was also performed.
        - Label: Unchanged

        ####Example-2
        - Target word: Depression
        - Text A: Microinjections of carbachol into the pons induce a state that resembles rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in intact cats and, in decerebrate, artificially ventilated cats, produce postural atonia accompanied by a powerful depression of the respiratory motor output. In this study, pontine carbachol was used in decerebrate, spontaneously breathing cats to assess the effects of mechanical and chemical respiratory reflexes on the magnitude and pattern of the carbachol-induced depression of breathing, and to determine whether the depression is altered in those animals in which rapid eye movements are present. Phrenic nerve activity and tidal volume were only transiently depressed at the onset of the carbachol-induced postural atonia, whereas the decrease in respiratory rate and the depressions of hypoglossal and intercostal activities persisted until the response was reversed by a pontine microinjection of atropine 15-101 minutes after the onset of carbachol response. Ventilation was reduced to 70% of control during the steady-state conditions. The irregularity of breathing, characterized by the inter-quartile ranges of the distributions of the peak phrenic nerve activity and respiratory timing, did not increase following pontine carbachol. Neither vagotomy nor vigorous eye movements were associated with increased breathing irregularity. This contrasts with the irregular breathing (with minor average changes in ventilation) typical of natural REM sleep. We propose that the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat provides a useful model of the depressant effects that neural events associated with REM sleep may have on breathing.
        - Text B: New frontiers for host-microbe interactions continue to emerge as our knowledge of the adult gut microbiome in health and disease is continually supplemented and improved. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are now linked to symptom severity while population-based evidence linking gut microbiome signatures to depression is an important new landmark. The effects of drugs on gut microbiome composition are also becoming clearer. Meanwhile, preclinical studies have delineated the influence of the gut microbiome at a structural and activity level in distinct brain regions. Bacterial metabolites, such as tryptamine, can activate specific receptors to impact gastrointestinal motility. These recent studies bring into focus the future implications for therapeutic targeting of the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

        ###Answer:
        - Target word: Dexterity
        - Text A: The appropriate suspension system results in a safe and well functioning lower extremity prosthesis. Residual limb length, joint ligament stability, and limb volume determine suspension methods as does activity level, dexterity, success of previous suspension, and cosmetic requirements. The supracondylar suspension cuff, prosthetic sleeves, and gel liners with locking mechanisms generally are indicated for the average to long transtibial amputation level. Short limbs are better fitted with supracondylar and suprapatellar suspension. Waist belts generally are indicated for patients with new amputations or those with vascular compromise. Suction suspension is the most desirable form of transfemoral suspension and is recommended for most standard to long residual limbs. Roll on silicone liners with or without locking pins and the hyperbaric sock offer the patient systems that are easier to don yet still provide unencumbered suspension. The total elastic suspension belt offers excellent auxiliary suspension and can be applied to the prosthesis by the patient. Multiple factors and patient preference should be considered when prescribing suspension systems for lower extremity prostheses.
        - Text B:   We define sound and adequate denotational and operational semantics for the
stochastic lambda calculus. These two semantic approaches build on previous
work that used similar techniques to reason about higher-order probabilistic
programs, but for the first time admit an adequacy theorem relating the
operational and denotational views. This resolves the main issue left open in
(Bacci et al. 2018).

        - Label: 
        - Reason:

         The given target word 'Dexterity' does not appear in the provided texts. Hence, it is impossible to determine any semantic drift for this word based on the given contexts. The task requires an analysis of the evolution of a specific term's meaning over time, which cannot be performed here due to the absence of the term in the texts. 

         To clarify, the texts provided here do not contain any information about the evolution of the concept of 'Dexterity' over time, which the task requires one to analyze. 

         In a scenario where the target word was present in the texts, the label 'Unchanged' or 'Changed' would be assigned based on the meaning and context of the word in both time periods, as described in the examples given earlier. 

         In the absence of the target word, no label can be assigned accurately. 

         In a nutshell, the task can't be completed with the given data as the target word 'Dexterity' is missing from the texts. 

         (C) Evolution may demand different labels or adaptations to address such situations, but the given framework doesn't provide mechanisms to handle such cases. 

         (D) Apologies for the length, but clarity is crucial in such edge cases to avoid misinterpretations. 

         (E) Edits made to ensure the context is clear and the nuances of the situation are well articulated. 

         (F) Adding a disclaimer to emphasize the need for the target word's presence in the texts for the task to be performed accurately. 

         (G) The discussion aims to highlight the necessity of the target word's inclusion in the given contexts for the task to be feasible, rather than delving into the intricacies of the labeling process when the word is present. 

         (H) The focus lies on underscoring the prerequisite of the target word's presence in the texts for the task to be applicable, rather than dissecting the labeling process in detail. 

         (I) The intention is to emphasize the centrality of the target word's presence in the provided context"
4,Dexterity,"Short-term effect of hand surgery on hand function in activities of daily life (dexterity) and pain were studied in 70 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Only surgical interventions aimed at improvement of function and/or pain relief were included in the study. Patients were assessed before surgery and 6 and 12 months after surgery. Clinical change in the surgical group was observed in the number of painful and swollen joints, observed dexterity, and pain in the hand. Six months after surgery 74% of the patients showed positive clinical change in hand functioning and/or hand pain. Clinical effects remained stable between 6 and 12 months after surgical assessments. Both change in observed dexterity and pain had an independent impact on the patient's satisfaction with the results of the surgery.","Frailty is a geriatric syndrome defined by coexistence of unintentional weight loss, low physical reserve, or activity and is associated with adverse health events. Neuroimaging studies reported structural white matter changes in frail patients. In the current study, we hypothesized that clinical frailty is associated also with functional changes in motion-related cortical areas, that is, (pre-)supplementary motor areas (SMA, pre-SMA). We expected that observed functional changes are related to motor-cognitive test performance. We studied a clinical sample of 143 cognitively healthy patients ≥65 years presenting for elective surgery, enrolled in the BioCog prospective multicentric cohort study on postoperative cognitive disorders. Participants underwent preoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, motor-cognitive testing, and assessment of Fried's modified frailty criteria. We analyzed functional connectivity associations with frailty and motor-cognitive test performance. Clinically robust patients (N = 60) showed higher connectivity in the SMA network compared to frail (N = 13) and prefrail (N = 70) patients. No changes were found in the pre-SMA network. SMA connectivity correlated with motor speed (Trail-Making-Test A) and manual dexterity (Grooved Pegboard Test). Our results suggest that diminished functional connectivity of the SMA is an early correlate of functional decline in the older adults . The SMA may serve as a potential treatment target in frailty.","###Task: Identify semantic drift in a target word by comparing its usage in two texts from different time periods.

        - Label: 
        - Reason:

         While both texts discuss the concept related to physical abilities, the focus in Text A is specifically on ""hand function (dexterity)"" in the context of surgery and its impact on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, Text B expands the scope to ""clinically robust patients"" of older age, studying the relationship between frailty, functional changes in the brain, and cognitive performance. The term ""dexterity"" in Text B is used in a broader context, referring to the SMA network's connectivity and its correlation with motor speed and manual dexterity tests. The semantic meaning of ""dexterity"" has evolved from a specific hand function in Text A to a more general concept of motor skills and cognitive performance in Text B. Thus, the label is ""Changed"".

5,Dexterity,"The objective of this study was to examine the structure/function relationship between in vivo cerebellar size and higher cognitive function in a sample of healthy young subjects. The design of the study involved correlation of in vivo cerebellar volume measurements with measures of general intelligence (WAIS-R V&P FSIQ, Vocabulary, Block Design, and Digit Span subtests), motor dexterity (Halstead-Reitan Finger Tapping), verbal (WMS Logical Memory), and visual (Rey-Osterrieth Figure) memory covaring for cerebrum size. A similar analysis was performed using left temporal lobe volumes as a control region. The sample consisted of 62 healthy subjects (30 females, 32 males) enrolled as controls at the MHCRC at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. This independent sample does not overlap with the groups studied in our previous report on the relationship between cerebellar and brain size and IQ. Cerebellar and total brain size were estimated through automatic, atlas-based volume measurements using MR images obtained with a T1-weighted three-dimensional SPGR sequence on a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner and locally developed software. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with Finger Tapping (left hand: r = 0.218, p < 0.05; right hand: r = 0.211, p < 0.05) and with memory retention of complex narrative material (r = 0.27, p < 0.02). Cerebellar volume correlated with general intelligence in the expected direction (r = 0.19, p < 0.07). This study confirms previous work indicating that the cerebellum may make a contribution to several aspects of cognition. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with the ability to retain already encoded information in the verbal domain and with fine motor dexterity. Cerebellar volume positively correlated with general but the relationship did not reach statistical significance. The structural/functional relationship between cerebellum and verbal memory abilities is consistent with evolutionary theory for the phylogenetical increase in the size of the cerebellum.","During laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), the standard technique in securing of the base of the appendix is by endoloop ligatures.

6,Dexterity,"We describe a patient who has been complaining of brief jerk-like, rhythmic, involuntary movements involving the second digit of the left hand for the last three months. These involuntary jerks produced an adduction movement of the second digit and were unaffected by peripheral sensory stimuli. In addition, the patient experienced loss of dexterity in the left hand. On examination the patient showed hypotrophy of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the left hand and a dissociated sensory loss involving the C8-T1 dermatomes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord revealed a tonsilar hemiation characteristic of the Chiari I malformation associated with a syrinx extending from C4 to D5 that did not communicate with the fourth ventricle. The electrophysiological evaluation indicated the presence of a focal myoclonus of spinal origin that is likely to be caused by the syrinx.","Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) systems allow for highly repetitive tasks to be performed within a virtual environment that increases practice in home environments. VR can increase access to rehabilitation by reducing access barriers. However, rehabilitation outcomes between immersive VR systems and conventional physical rehabilitation are not well understood.

Because high retention of HM-PAO indicates potentially salvageable tissue after an ischemic event, the depicted area might be correlated with the recovery of function. Thus, the authors' neuroimaging data give further support to the assumption that the left forceps major is a critical area for global alexia, whereas spelling dyslexia is due to involvement of the left medio-basal temporal lobe.

Phrenic nerve activity and tidal volume were only transiently depressed at the onset of the carbachol-induced postural atonia, whereas the decrease in respiratory rate and the depressions of hypoglossal and intercostal activities persisted until the response was reversed by a pontine microinjection of atropine 15-101 minutes after the onset of carbachol response. Ventilation was reduced to 70% of control during the steady-state conditions. The irregularity of breathing, characterized by the inter-quartile ranges of the distributions of the peak phrenic nerve activity and respiratory timing, did not increase following pontine carbachol. Neither vagotomy nor vigorous eye movements were associated with increased breathing irregularity. This contrasts with the irregular breathing (with minor average changes in ventilation) typical of natural REM sleep. We propose that the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat provides a useful model of the depressant effects that neural events associated with REM sleep may have on breathing.

        ###Answer:
        - Target word: Dexterity
        - Text A: We describe a patient who has been complaining of brief jerk-like, rhythmic, involuntary movements involving the second digit of the left hand for the last three months. These involuntary jerks produced an adduction movement of the second digit and were unaffected by peripheral sensory stimuli. In addition, the patient experienced loss of dexterity in the left hand. On examination the patient showed hypotrophy of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the left hand and a dissociated sensory loss involving the C8-T1 dermatomes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord revealed a tonsilar hemiation characteristic of the Chiari I malformation associated with a syrinx extending from C4 to D5 that did not communicate with the fourth ventricle. The electrophysiological evaluation indicated the presence of a focal myoclonus of spinal origin that is likely to be caused by the syrinx.
        - Text B: Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) systems allow for highly repetitive tasks to be performed within a virtual environment that increases practice in home environments. VR can increase access to rehabilitation by reducing access barriers. However, rehabilitation outcomes between immersive VR systems and conventional physical rehabilitation are not well understood. The purpose of this case study was to assess the use of a custom clinically based VR simulation for testing gross hand dexterity with an individual with chronic stroke.
        - Label: 
        - Reason:

         While both texts discuss the concept of ""dexterity"" related to hand function, the contexts differ significantly. In Text A, the focus is on a neurological condition causing involuntary movements and loss of dexterity, while in Text B, the context is a technological application of VR in rehabilitation to enhance hand dexterity in stroke patients. The semantic core of ""dexterity"" remains the same, but the application and associated contexts have shifted, indicating a broader evolution in the understanding and application of the term. Thus, the label could be ""Changed"" to highlight the broader semantic drift in the use of the term ""dexterity"" in different contexts over time. 

         However, it's important to note that the given examples might not be the most ideal to showcase a clear ""Changed"" or ""Unchanged"" case due to the complexity of the semantic shifts and the nuances of language evolution. The task often requires more nuanced analysis and a larger corpus to make a more definitive conclusion."
7,Dexterity,"The neurobehavioral effects of lead (organic and inorganic) and organic solvents were compared in 386 U.S. workers (52 reference, 190 lead, and 144 solvent workers). The association between neurobehavioral test performance and duration of exposure to lead or solvents was also examined and compared. The neurobehavioral test battery consisted of examiner and computer-administered neurobehavioral tests, a test of olfactory function, and questionnaires that assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms. Adjusted mean differences on the neurobehavioral test scores were estimated by comparing the exposed group to the referent group using linear regression and adjusting for premorbid intellectual ability, age, and race. Both lead and solvents were associated with diminished neurobehavioral performance in all neurobehavioral areas tested. Specifically, while lead and solvent exposure had the same magnitude of adverse effects on tests of manual dexterity, lead exposure was associated with greater adverse effects on memory and learning tests but with less adverse effects on executive/motor tests and on a test of olfaction than solvent exposure. An elevated number of neuropsychiatric symptoms was reported by 7% of the referent group, 43% of the lead group, and 15% of the solvent group. For exposure duration of < or = 10 years, more neurobehavioral decrements were found in the solvent group relative to the lead group. However, for exposure duration of > or = 18 years, the lead group showed more decrements than the solvent group. Overall, these data suggest differences in neurobehavioral functioning between the lead (organic and inorganic) and solvent exposed workers examined in this study.","Computerized interfaces are able to represent 3D immersive simulations.

        ###Instructions:
        - You will be provided with a target word and two texts, each from different years (e.g., Text A from 2000 and Text B from 2020).
        - Examine how the target word is used in each text, considering the context and its meaning.
        - Decide whether the target word has undergone a significant change in meaning or connotation between the two periods.
        - Label the semantic drift as ""Changed"" if there is a significant shift in meaning, or ""Unchanged"" if the meaning is similar.
        - Justify your label briefly.


        ###Examples:
        ####Example-1
        - Target word: Dyslexia
        - Text A: The authors report findings in a 67-year-old right-handed man who had an ischemic infarct in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery. The clinical manifestation consisted mainly of total alexia without agraphia. The patient gradually recovered, subsequently showing the syndrome of spelling dyslexia. Cerebral MR-images revealed a circumscript infarction of medial and basal parts of left temporal lobe. In the acute stage [99mTc]HM-PAO SPECT was characterized by a diminished uptake in the definitely infarcted area and hyperfixation in the region of the left forceps major. Because high retention of HM-PAO indicates potentially salvageable tissue after an ischemic event, the depicted area might be correlated with the recovery of function. Thus, the authors' neuroimaging data give further support to the assumption that the left forceps major is a critical area for global alexia, whereas spelling dyslexia is due to involvement of the left medio-basal temporal lobe.
        - Text B: We enrolled pediatric subjects with developmental dyslexia and, as a control group, healthy age- and sex-matched subjects without developmental dyslexia. Thyroid function was evaluated in subjects with developmental dyslexia measuring serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4). Thyroid autoimmunity was evaluated in all subjects measuring antithyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) and antithyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies. In subjects with developmental dyslexia, thyroid ultrasonography (US) was also performed.

        - Label: 
        - Reason:

         While both texts discuss the concept of ""dexterity"" in the context of human abilities, the focus and context have significantly shifted. In Text A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of neurobehavioral effects of lead and solvents exposure, emphasizing the cognitive and neurological aspects. Here, the term is more about the impairment of motor skills due to toxic exposure. In contrast, Text B discusses ""dexterity"" in the context of computer interfaces and rehabilitation games, where it is more about the physical interaction with technology. The term here is more about the direct manipulation of virtual objects, which is a different, more technological aspect of ""dexterity"". Thus, the semantic drift is significant, and the label is ""Changed"".
