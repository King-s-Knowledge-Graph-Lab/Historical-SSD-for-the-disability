0,Dexterity,"Loss of sensory function is a severe impairment for the hand which loses a lot of its dexterity, becomes ""blind"" if not guided by sight and is susceptible to burns, wounds and infections. Nerve repair by sutures or grafts is the preeminent operation if the condition of the skin is good. When skin is damaged, various sensory flaps (both free microvascular and local pedicle) may be used. Island flaps from the pulp of another digit give inconsistent results. Sensory flaps from the back of the index finger to the thumb give a fair two-point discrimination. Free microvascular flaps from the pulp or the web of the hallux or from two or even three toes are safe and good operations which restore both perfect skin coverage and excellent sensory function with good two-point discrimination. The damage at the donor site is well tolerated. When previous operations have covered the digit or the hand by means of non-sensory skin, direct neurotization of this skin is possible. Research has been done in animals showing the formation of free endings inside the neurotized skin. Rehabilitation of the previously existing sensory corpuscles is even possible. Our series includes 12 island flaps from the pulp, 19 pedicle flaps from the dorsum, 17 homodigital reverse flow flaps, 38 different types of free neurovascular flaps from the foot and 3 direct sensory neurotization.","Brain lesions may disturb hand functioning in children with cerebral palsy (CP), making it difficult or even impossible for them to perform several manual activities. Most conventional treatments for hand dysfunction in CP assume that reducing the hand dysfunctions will improve the capacity to manage activities (i.e., manual ability, MA). The aim of this study was to investigate the directional relationships (direct and indirect pathways) through which hand skills influence MA in children with CP. A total of 136 children with CP (mean age: 10 years; range: 6-16 years; 35 quadriplegics, 24 diplegics, 77 hemiplegics) were assessed. Six hand skills were measured on both hands: touch-pressure detection (Semmes-Weinstein esthesiometer), stereognosis (Manual Form Perception Test), proprioception (passive mobilization of the metacarpophalangeal joints), grip strength (GS) (Jamar dynamometer), gross manual dexterity (GMD) (Box and Block Test), and fine finger dexterity (Purdue Pegboard Test). MA was measured with the ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire. Correlation coefficients were used to determine the linear associations between observed variables. A path analysis of structural equation modeling was applied to test different models of causal relationships among the observed variables. Purely sensory impairments did seem not to play a significant role in the capacity to perform manual activities. According to path analysis, GMD in both hands and stereognosis in the dominant hand were directly related to MA, whereas GS was indirectly related to MA through its relationship with GMD. However, one-third of the variance in MA measures could not be explained by hand skills. It can be concluded that MA is not simply the integration of hand skills in daily activities and should be treated per se, supporting activity-based interventions.

Reasoning: The word ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between the two sentences. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to perform manual tasks with precision and skill, specifically in the context of hand surgery. In Sentence B, ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to perform daily activities, such as manual tasks, without any specific reference to hand surgery or sensory impairments.

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of neurophysiological and psychological tests administered to patients with solvent poisoning. The term is used to describe the patients' ability to perform various tasks, such as grasping and manipulating objects, and is associated with abnormal EEG and slow nerve conduction velocities. The meaning of ""dexterity"" in this context is related to the patients' neurological functioning and cognitive abilities.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a completely different context. It is used to describe the complexity and importance of the human hand in performing various tasks of daily living. The term is associated with the development of smart prosthetic hands and the ability of these devices to mimic all activities that a person might perform. The meaning of ""dexterity"" in this context is related to the technical capabilities of prosthetic devices and the needs of users.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of ""dexterity"" has changed significantly between the two time periods. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" is used to describe neurological functioning and cognitive abilities, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe the technical capabilities of prosthetic devices. Therefore, I would label this term as ""Changed""."
2,Dexterity,"The aim of this study was to extend the understanding of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) into adulthood. We recruited 19 adults aged between 18 and 65 who had received diagnoses of DCD or dyspraxia or who self-reported as having motor impairments consistent with a history of DCD, together with age- and gender-matched controls. Participants were given tests of manual dexterity, handwriting, construction, obstacle avoidance, dynamic balance, static balance, dual task performance, ball skills, reaction time, movement time and sequencing. As a group, adults with DCD performed more poorly than controls across all tasks. Slowness and variability of movement was a pervasive feature of their performance and many individuals had considerable problems with sequencing and with dual task performance. A discriminant function analysis conducted using six performance measures correctly classified participants as car drivers or non-drivers.

The meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has changed significantly between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the motor skills of adults with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), highlighting their difficulties with manual tasks. In Sentence B, the word is used to describe the potential of 3D Virtual Reality (VR) technology to assess manual dexterity in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), without any connotation of motor impairments. Therefore, the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted from a negative connotation to a neutral or even positive one between the two sentences."

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of a prosthetic limb, specifically to describe the suitability of different suspension methods based on the individual's residual limb length, joint stability, and other factors. In this context, ""dexterity"" likely refers to the ability of the limb to perform specific tasks, such as walking or running.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a completely different context, to describe the semantics of a stochastic lambda calculus. In this context, ""dexterity"" likely refers to the ability of the calculus to accurately model and reason about probabilistic programs.

Given the significant difference in context and meaning between the two sentences, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone semantic drift and now has a different connotation. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."
4,Dexterity,"Short-term effect of hand surgery on hand function in activities of daily life (dexterity) and pain were studied in 70 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the hand function of patients with rheumatoid arthritis before and after surgery. The sentence highlights the improvement in hand function and pain relief after surgery, indicating that the word ""dexterity"" in this context means improved ability to perform hand functions with reduced pain.

In Sentence B, the target word ""frailty"" is used to describe a geriatric syndrome characterized by unintentional weight loss, low physical reserve, or activity. The sentence discusses the association of clinical frailty with functional changes in motion-related cortical areas, specifically the supplementary motor areas. The sentence highlights the correlation between functional connectivity in the SMA network and motor speed and manual dexterity, suggesting that the word ""frailty"" in this context means reduced ability to perform manual tasks due to age-related changes in the brain.

Based on the context and meaning of the target word in each sentence, it is clear that the word ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between the two timestamps. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" refers to improved hand function and pain relief after surgery, indicating a positive connotation. In Sentence B, ""frailty"" refers to reduced ability to perform manual tasks due to age-related changes in the brain, indicating a negative connotation. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for the target word ""dexterity""."
5,Dexterity,"The objective of this study was to examine the structure/function relationship between in vivo cerebellar size and higher cognitive function in a sample of healthy young subjects. The design of the study involved correlation of in vivo cerebellar volume measurements with measures of general intelligence (WAIS-R V&P FSIQ, Vocabulary, Block Design, and Digit Span subtests), motor dexterity (Halstead-Reitan Finger Tapping), verbal (WMS Logical Memory), and visual (Rey-Osterrieth Figure) memory covaring for cerebrum size. A similar analysis was performed using left temporal lobe volumes as a control region. The sample consisted of 62 healthy subjects (30 females, 32 males) enrolled as controls at the MHCRC at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. This independent sample does not overlap with the groups studied in our previous report on the relationship between cerebellar and brain size and IQ. Cerebellar and total brain size were estimated through automatic, atlas-based volume measurements using MR images obtained with a T1-weighted three-dimensional SPGR sequence on a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner and locally developed software. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with Finger Tapping (left hand: r = 0.218, p < 0.05; right hand: r = 0.211, p < 0.05) and with memory retention of complex narrative material (r = 0.27, p < 0.02). Cerebellar volume correlated with general intelligence in the expected direction (r = 0.19, p < 0.07). This study confirms previous work indicating that the cerebellum may make a contribution to several aspects of cognition. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with the ability to retain already encoded information in the verbal domain and with fine motor dexterity. Cerebellar volume positively correlated with general but the relationship did not reach statistical significance.

        Target word: Dexterity
        Sentence A: The objective of this study was to examine the structure/function relationship between in vivo cerebellar size and higher cognitive function in a sample of healthy young subjects. The design of the study involved correlation of in vivo cerebellar volume measurements with measures of general intelligence (WAIS-R V&P FSIQ, Vocabulary, Block Design, and Digit Span subtests), motor dexterity (Halstead-Reitan Finger Tapping), verbal (WMS Logical Memory), and visual (Rey-Osterrieth Figure) memory covaring for cerebrum size. A similar analysis was performed using left temporal lobe volumes as a control region. The sample consisted of 62 healthy subjects (30 females, 32 males) enrolled as controls at the MHCRC at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. This independent sample does not overlap with the groups studied in our previous report on the relationship between cerebellar and brain size and IQ. Cerebellar and total brain size were estimated through automatic, atlas-based volume measurements using MR images obtained with a T1-weighted three-dimensional SPGR sequence on a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner and locally developed software. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with Finger Tapping (left hand: r = 0.218, p < 0.05; right hand: r = 0.211, p < 0.05) and with memory retention of complex narrative material (r = 0.27, p < 0.02). Cerebellar volume correlated with general intelligence in the expected direction (r = 0.19, p < 0.07). This study confirms previous work indicating that the cerebellum may make a contribution to several aspects of cognition. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with the ability to retain already encoded information in the verbal domain and with fine motor dexterity. Cerebellar volume positively correlated with general but the relationship did not reach statistical significance. The structural/functional relationship between cerebellum and verbal memory abilities is consistent with evolutionary theory for the phylogenetical increase in the size of the cerebellum.
        Sentence B: During laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), the standard technique in securing of the base of the appendix is by endoloop ligatures. However, application of the endoloop demands dexterity and a short training, while hem-o-lok clips may be more advantageous to use due to their simplicity of application and low cost.

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of a scientific study to describe the relationship between the size of the cerebellum and cognitive function. The study found that the cerebellum was significantly correlated with fine motor dexterity, as measured by finger tapping. This usage of ""dexterity"" implies a connection to physical coordination and motor skills.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the ease of use of a medical device. The sentence suggests that the device is easy to use and requires little training, implying a connection to simplicity and ease of use rather than physical coordination.

Therefore, the meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted from a connection to physical coordination to a connection to ease of use. This constitutes semantic drift, and the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        The meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe a patient's loss of coordination and muscle weakness in the left hand, specifically in the context of a neurological disorder. In contrast, in Sentence B, the word is used to describe the repetitive tasks performed in a virtual environment as part of a rehabilitation program. The word's connotation has shifted from a medical context to a technological context. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Explanation:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of neurobehavioral functioning, specifically in relation to the effects of lead and solvent exposure on cognitive and motor functions. The sentence highlights the negative impact of exposure on manual dexterity, memory, and learning, with a greater adverse effect observed in the lead group compared to the solvent group. The term ""dexterity"" carries a negative connotation in this context, suggesting a decline in cognitive and motor abilities due to exposure to toxic substances.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, specifically in relation to computerized interfaces and rehabilitation games. The sentence highlights the use of various input devices, including joysticks, mice, and force transducers, to enable ""direct"" manipulation of virtual objects in 3D. The term ""dexterity"" carries a positive connotation in this context, suggesting improved cognitive and motor abilities through training and rehabilitation.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant shift in meaning between the two timestamps. In Sentence A, the term is associated with negative effects of exposure on cognitive and motor functions, while in Sentence B, it is associated with improved cognitive and motor abilities through training and rehabilitation. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the performance of neuropsychological and information processing tests. The context suggests that the term refers to the ability to perform tasks that require manual dexterity, such as attention, executive function, and working memory. In this context, the word ""dexterity"" has not undergone significant semantic drift.

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the shape of the mastoid processes and clavicles. The context suggests that the term refers to the degree of manual dexterity required to shape these skeletal elements. In this context, the word ""dexterity"" has undergone significant semantic drift, as it now refers to a different aspect of manual dexterity, specifically the ability to shape the skeletal elements of the shoulder suspension apparatus.

        Explanation:

In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the fine finger dexterity of humans. The sentence suggests that the ability to perform complex motor tasks with precision and speed is a unique feature of humans, and there is no lateralized behavior other than this trait that relates to handedness. The sentence does not convey any negative or positive connotations associated with the word ""dexterity.""

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the luminosity of Sgr A* in the near-infrared and X-ray bands. The sentence suggests that the luminosity of Sgr A* can increase by factors of $10-100$ over a period of $60$ minutes, and that this increase is associated with magnetic reconnection events in the accretion flow. The sentence does not convey any negative or positive connotations associated with the word ""dexterity"" in this context.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has not changed significantly between the two time periods. The word is still used to describe fine motor skills and dexterity, but the context in which it is used has shifted from describing human abilities to describing the luminosity of Sgr A*. Therefore, the label ""Unchanged"" is appropriate."
10,Dexterity,"In order to evaluate the bilateral asymmetries in evoked electrodermal activity (EDA) and the use of EDA parameters as indices of relative hemispheric activation, skin resistance level (SRL), skin resistance response (SRR), and the SRR latency (L) were examined in 25 right-handed male subjects. We used bilateral recording with a unilateral stimulation (auditory click/patellar tendon tap) to assess the asymmetries of EDA variables related to the side of stimulation and to handedness. Although no significant asymmetry in C = SRRmax/SRL ratio was found, significant differences in latency were observed. Ipsilateral responses were 100 ms faster than contralateral responses for auditory stimulus, a result that can be explained in terms of contralateral delay of neuronal communication on EDA-l pathway. Response latency to reflex-motor activation was 60-100 ms shorter in the dominant hand, regardless of the stimulation site used. This result indicates that the reaction time of the EDA-2 pathway of the left hemisphere was shorter than the right for right-handed subjects. It is concluded that there is hemispheric asymmetry on EDA-2 pathway and that this asymmetry appears to be dependent on the preferred dexterity. These results have implications for the influence of both central and peripheral factors on EDA laterality and principally on laterality of response amplitude. Further, there is no single cortical mechanism modulating the asymmetries in the latency of this response.","Age, education, and gender are the most common covariates used to define normative standards against which neuropsychological (NP) performance is interpreted, but influences of other demographic factors have begun to be appreciated.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability to perform a specific task (i.e., bilateral asymmetries in evoked electrodermal activity). The context suggests that the term refers to the subject's physical ability to perform the task, as measured by skin resistance level and skin resistance response. The sentence does not provide any information about the meaning of ""dexterity"" in a broader context, and it does not imply any connotation or emotional valence.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context. It is used to describe the ability to perform cognitive tasks, specifically in the domain of executive functions and visual reasoning. The sentence also suggests that the term ""dexterity"" may connote a certain level of academic skill use. The context and meaning of the term have shifted significantly between the two sentences, indicating semantic drift."

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the endoscopist's manual skills and technical ability, emphasizing the importance of precise movements and experience in performing colonoscopy. The word carries a positive connotation, implying that the endoscopist must be skilled and proficient in their work.

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, referring to the impact of instrument characteristics and analysis choices on the accuracy of power spectrum measurements. The word carries a neutral connotation, as it is used to describe a technical aspect of the analysis rather than the endoscopist's abilities.

Based on these differences in context and connotation, it can be argued that the meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between the two sentences, indicating semantic drift. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the recovery of finger dexterity and sensitivity in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy following surgical intervention. The term is used in the context of the patient's ability to perform manual tasks, such as walking and using their hands. In this context, the term ""dexterity"" implies a high level of manual dexterity and coordination, which is necessary for everyday activities.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the effectiveness of a training program for children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. In this context, the term ""dexterity"" implies the ability to perform specific hand functions, such as fine and gross motor bimanual activities, with a high level of skill and accuracy. The term is used in the context of the child's ability to perform tasks that require hand-eye coordination and dexterity, such as writing, drawing, and using tools.

Based on these differences in context and meaning, it can be concluded that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe the recovery of manual dexterity in patients with a neurological condition, while in Sentence B, the term is used to describe the effectiveness of a training program for children with a developmental disorder.

15,Dexterity,"Children with spastic hemiplegia have impaired dexterity in the affected extremity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the force co-ordination pattern during precision grip in 13 children between 4 and 10 years of age with predominant unilateral brain lesions is related to manual dexterity and to the location and size of the brain lesion. The force co-ordination pattern was investigated by means of a specially designed object that monitored the isometric fingertip forces applied to the contact surfaces during precision grip. Hand function was measured by means of neurological examination, functional hand-grips and dexterity. Brain lesions were identified by series of ultrasound and MRI scans. Normally, the fingertip forces are applied to the object in the initial phase of the lift in an invariant force co-ordination pattern (i.e. grip-lift synergy), in which the grip and load forces are initiated simultaneously and increase in parallel with unimodal force rate trajectories. A majority of children with unilateral brain lesions had not developed the force co-ordination pattern typical for their age, but produced an immature or a pathological pattern. The developmental level of the grip-lift synergy was determined and quantified according to criteria derived from earlier studies on normally developed children. There was a clear relationship between the developmental level of the grip-lift synergy and impaired dexterity, indicating that proper development of the force co-ordination pattern is important for skilled hand function. The grip-lift synergy correlated with the total extent of lesions in the contralateral cortex and white matter and with lesions in the thalamus/basal ganglia, while no correlation was found for isolated cortical lesions. The results suggest that the neural circuits involved in the control of the precision grip are organized in a parallel and distributed system in the hemispheres, and that the basal ganglia are important during the formation of these circuits. Perinatal lesions in specific cortical motor areas may be compensated for by circuits elsewhere in the grip-lift motor system, while large lesions exclude this possibility.","Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a prevalent condition in which spinal degeneration causes cord compression and neurological dysfunction.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability of children with spastic hemiplegia to perform precise movements with their affected limbs. The sentence highlights the importance of manual dexterity for skilled hand function, and notes that impaired dexterity is a common feature of children with unilateral brain lesions. In contrast, Sentence B does not mention ""dexterity"" at all. Instead, it focuses on the clinical features of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), including neurological dysfunction, and the various outcome measures used to quantify impairment in DCM patients.

The difference in the usage and meaning of ""dexterity"" between the two sentences suggests that the term has undergone semantic drift. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" is used in a medical context to describe a specific aspect of motor function, while in Sentence B, it is not used at all. This change in meaning could be due to a shift in the way the term is understood or used in the medical field, or it could be due to a change in the broader cultural context in which the term is used. Regardless of the reason, the difference in the usage and meaning of ""dexterity"" between the two sentences indicates that semantic drift has occurred."
16,Dexterity,"Nonhierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify 92 patients with rheumatoid arthritis drawn from a community rheumatology practice into 5 groups on the basis of biochemical measures and disease indices. The major differentiating variables were the number of active joints, number of damaged joints, overall disease activity, extraarticular complications, and history of joint surgery. Although the 5 subclasses were equivalent on measures of psychological functioning, they differed systematically on such health outcome measures as mobility, physical activity, and dexterity. Relationships between the taxonomy produced through cluster analysis and conventional classifications are discussed, and directions for further investigation are noted.","  Multimorbidity, or the presence of several medical conditions in the same
individual, has been increasing in the population, both in absolute and
relative terms. However, multimorbidity remains poorly understood, and the
evidence from existing research to describe its burden, determinants and
consequences has been limited. Previous studies attempting to understand
multimorbidity patterns are often cross-sectional and do not explicitly account
for multimorbidity patterns' evolution over time; some of them are based on
small datasets and/or use arbitrary and narrow age ranges; and those that
employed advanced models, usually lack appropriate benchmarking and
validations. In this study, we (1) introduce a novel approach for using
Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) for temporal phenotyping (i.e.,
simultaneously mining disease clusters and their trajectories); (2) provide
quantitative metrics for the evaluation of disease clusters from such studies;
and (3) demonstrate how the temporal characteristics of the disease clusters
that result from our model can help mine multimorbidity networks and generate
new hypotheses for the emergence of various multimorbidity patterns over time.
We trained and evaluated our models on one of the world's largest electronic

        Sentence A: Nonhierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify 92 patients with rheumatoid arthritis drawn from a community rheumatology practice into 5 groups on the basis of biochemical measures and disease indices. The major differentiating variables were the number of active joints, number of damaged joints, overall disease activity, extraarticular complications, and history of joint surgery. Although the 5 subclasses were equivalent on measures of psychological functioning, they differed systematically on such health outcome measures as mobility, physical activity, and dexterity. Relationships between the taxonomy produced through cluster analysis and conventional classifications are discussed, and directions for further investigation are noted.
        Sentence B:   Multimorbidity, or the presence of several medical conditions in the same
individual, has been increasing in the population, both in absolute and
relative terms. However, multimorbidity remains poorly understood, and the
evidence from existing research to describe its burden, determinants and
consequences has been limited. Previous studies attempting to understand
multimorbidity patterns are often cross-sectional and do not explicitly account
for multimorbidity patterns' evolution over time; some of them are based on
small datasets and/or use arbitrary and narrow age ranges; and those that
employed advanced models, usually lack appropriate benchmarking and
validations. In this study, we (1) introduce a novel approach for using
Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) for temporal phenotyping (i.e.,
simultaneously mining disease clusters and their trajectories); (2) provide
quantitative metrics for the evaluation of disease clusters from such studies;
and (3) demonstrate how the temporal characteristics of the disease clusters
that result from our model can help mine multimorbidity networks and generate
new hypotheses for the emergence of various multimorbidity patterns over time.
We trained and evaluated our models on one of the world's largest electronic
health records (EHR), with 7 million patients, from which over 2 million where
relevant to this study.

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of a biochemical measure, specifically the ability to perform manual tasks with precision. In Sentence B, the term is used in the context of multimorbidity patterns, specifically the ability to manage multiple medical conditions simultaneously. The meaning of the term has shifted from a physical/manual context to a broader health-related context, indicating semantic drift."
17,Dexterity,"The speed of alternating movements at the ankle, metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints in 11 healthy children and 13 adults doubled between age 3 and 11 years, despite a 32-fold increase in limb-segment inertia produced by the doubling in limb length over the same period.

Explanation:
In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the correlation between manual dexterity and living in a nursing home. The context suggests that the term refers to physical dexterity, as it is used in the context of elderly individuals and their ability to perform manual tasks. In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the difference in corticospinal excitability between the left and right hemispheres in young adults. In this context, the term likely refers to cognitive dexterity, or the ability to perform cognitive tasks with speed and accuracy.

The semantic drift of the target word ""dexterity"" between the two sentences is evident. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe physical abilities, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe cognitive abilities. This shift in meaning suggests that the term has undergone semantic drift, and its meaning has changed over time. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of a study examining the relationship between dental aptitude test scores and psychomotor performance. The term is used to describe the predictive value of these scores, and it does not convey any particular connotation or meaning related to manual dexterity. Therefore, there is no semantic drift in the usage of the term ""dexterity"" in this sentence.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, where it is related to the patient's ability to walk and talk after a surgical procedure. The term is used to describe the patient's ability to perform physical tasks, and it conveys a sense of manual dexterity and coordination. This usage of the term ""dexterity"" demonstrates semantic drift, as the term has taken on a different meaning in this sentence. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of robotics and surgery, specifically to describe the ability of robots to perform precise tasks through small incisions. The word is used to highlight the advanced capabilities of the robotic system, such as increased intra-abdominal articulations and 3D visual capacity. The meaning of the word in this sentence is focused on the technical capabilities of the robot and its potential to improve surgical outcomes.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the coordinated movement of the hands for precision tasks such as computer use, writing, or buttoning a shirt. The word is used to emphasize the importance of hand function and the impact of brain motor networks on hand movement. The meaning of the word in this sentence is focused on the everyday activities that require dexterity and the importance of proper hand function.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted from a focus on the technical capabilities of a robotic system to a focus on the everyday activities that require hand function and coordination. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Reasoning:
The target word ""dexterity"" has undergone significant change in meaning between the two sentences. In Sentence A, dexterity is associated with manual and digital techniques in surgery, emphasizing the importance of tactile skills for technical proficiency. In contrast, in Sentence B, dexterity is related to cardiorespiratory fitness and neurophysiological attributes, with a focus on genomic intervention and the impact of aging on cognitive function. The word has shifted from a focus on manual skills to a broader concept encompassing physical and cognitive abilities. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of evaluating the hand and wrist function according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of medical technology, specifically the ability of a surgical instrument to be accurately detected and identified in a surgical scene. The term has a different connotation, referring to the precision and accuracy of the instrument's movement.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe a 65-year-old man's ability to perform a specific motor task (i.e., strangling) with precision and control. The context suggests that the man's dexterity is impaired, as he appears to be emotionally blunted and lacks insight into his actions. Additionally, the presence of a cyst in his brain and abnormalities in his EEG and PET scans further suggest that his dexterity is affected.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context to describe the association between muscle performance, LED, and agility in soccer athletes. The word is used to describe the ability to dynamically regulate foot-ground interactions, which is unrelated to the impaired motor control described in Sentence A.

Based on these two contexts, it is clear that the meaning of ""dexterity"" has changed between the two sentences.

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of neuropsychologic sequelae after cardiac operation. The sentence implies that the term refers to the patient's ability to perform cognitive tasks, such as attention, psychomotor speed, and fine motor skills, after surgery. However, in Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, referring to the ability of a robot to receive objects with unseen geometry handed over by humans. The sentence suggests that the term ""dexterity"" has shifted its meaning to refer to the robot's ability to perform a specific task, rather than the patient's cognitive abilities. Therefore, semantic drift has occurred in the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" between the two sentences."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability of cats to perform a specific task. The sentence implies that cats with a preference for using their left paw are more likely to exhibit a tremor when given certain drugs. The word ""dexterity"" carries a positive connotation, implying skill or coordination.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context to describe the polarization effects of the VLTI and GRAVITY instruments. The sentence implies that the instruments are capable of measuring the polarization of astrophysical sources with high precision, and that the polarization effects do not limit astrometric observations of polarized targets. The word ""dexterity"" carries a different connotation in this sentence, implying precision or accuracy.

Based on the different contexts and connotations associated with the word ""dexterity"" in the two sentences, it is clear that the word has undergone a significant change in meaning or connotation between the two timestamps. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

In contrast, Sentence B uses ""dexterity"" to describe the manipulator's ability to perform smooth and agile motions, which suggests a different meaning of the word in this context. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for Sentence A.

        Target word: manipulator
        
        Sentence A: Laparoscopic techniques have allowed surgeons to perform operations through small incisions. However, the benefits of laparoscopy are still limited to less complex procedures because of losses in imaging and dexterity compared to conventional surgery. This project is developing miniature robots to be placed within the abdominal cavity to assist the surgeon. These remotely controlled in vivo robots provide the surgeon with an enhanced field of view from arbitrary angles as well as provide dexterous manipulators not constrained by small incisions in the abdominal wall.
        
        Label: Unchanged
        
        Reasoning: In Sentence A, the word ""manipulator"" is used to describe a robotic device used in surgery. The context suggests that the meaning of ""manipulator"" remains similar in both sentences, emphasizing the device's ability to perform precise and dexterous movements. Therefore, the label ""Unchanged"" is appropriate for Sentence A."

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of a patient's muscle isolation and coordination abilities, particularly in the upper, middle, and lower trapezius fibers. The term suggests a focus on physical dexterity and coordination. In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of a virtual reality software application that mimics hand movements for the performance of fibreoptic skills. The term suggests a focus on digital dexterity and the ability to manipulate virtual objects with precision.

The meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted in Sentence B, from a focus on physical dexterity to a focus on digital dexterity. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

        1. Changed

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of measuring the suitability of jobs for aging workers, specifically in relation to manual dexterity. The sentence does not convey any connotations of the term that might indicate a change in meaning. Therefore, semantic drift has not occurred in this case.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, specifically in relation to the performance of students using a virtual reality haptic simulator for operative dentistry. The sentence conveys a sense of manual dexterity and precision, which is consistent with the original meaning of the term. However, the sentence also highlights the improvement in student performance when using the simulator, which suggests a positive connotation that was not present in the original meaning of the term. Therefore, semantic drift has occurred in this case, and the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."
35,Dexterity,"Two groups (N = 19) of clinically test anxious college students received a common core treatment program of cognitive behavior therapy, progressive muscular relaxation training, and thermal biofeedback assisted relaxation training.

The overall efficacy of the program was demonstrated with reductions in test, trait and state anxiety, and increases in the rationality of personal belief systems. Performance on an anagram solution task conducted under highly distracting conditions and evaluative interactions was improved significantly, as was motoric performance on a manual dexterity task. In vivo distraction-coping was not found to result in more efficacious treatment as measured by self-report and performance variables.","  Dexterous manipulation of objects in virtual environments with our bare
hands, by using only a depth sensor and a state-of-the-art 3D hand pose
estimator (HPE), is challenging. While virtual environments are ruled by
physics, e.g. object weights and surface frictions, the absence of force
feedback makes the task challenging, as even slight inaccuracies on finger tips
or contact points from HPE may make the interactions fail. Prior arts simply
generate contact forces in the direction of the fingers' closures, when finger
joints penetrate virtual objects. Although useful for simple grasping
scenarios, they cannot be applied to dexterous manipulations such as in-hand
manipulation. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL)
approaches train agents that learn skills by using task-specific rewards,
without considering any online user input. In this work, we propose to learn a
model that maps noisy input hand poses to target virtual poses, which
introduces the needed contacts to accomplish the tasks on a physics simulator.
The agent is trained in a residual setting by using a model-free hybrid RL+IL
approach. A 3D hand pose estimation reward is introduced leading to an
improvement on HPE accuracy when the physics-guided corrected target poses are
remapped to the input space. As the model corrects HPE errors by applying minor
but crucial joint displacements for contacts, this helps to keep the generated
motion visually close to the user input. Since HPE sequences performing
successful virtual interactions do not exist, a data generation scheme to train
and evaluate the system is proposed. We test our framework in two applications
that use hand pose estimates for dexterous manipulations: hand-object
interactions in VR and hand-object motion reconstruction in-the-wild.

Explanation:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the efficacy of a treatment program in reducing anxiety and improving cognitive and motor functions. The context suggests that the term refers to the ability to perform tasks with precision and skill. In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the challenge of manipulating objects in virtual environments. The context suggests that the term now refers to the ability to perform tasks with precision and skill in a virtual environment, with a focus on the use of technology to enhance dexterity.

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" has a more general meaning, referring to the ability to perform tasks with skill and precision. In Sentence B, the term has a more specific meaning, referring to the ability to perform tasks in a virtual environment with the aid of technology. As a result, semantic drift has occurred in the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" over the course of 20 years. Therefore, I would label this sentence as ""Changed""."

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of sexuality and left-handedness, implying a connection between manual skill and non-normative traits.

        Reasoning: In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the slowed reaching and disturbance of establishing the precision grip in Parkinson's disease patients.

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the minimally invasive approach of VATS, which allows for easier and safer performance of segmentectomies.

38,Dexterity,"The intermediate functional results were assessed for fifty-seven patients who had had a limb-salvage procedure for treatment of a tumor of the shoulder girdle region at our institution from 1980 through 1990. Fifty-three patients had a malignant bone tumor (a sarcoma) and four had an extensive giant-cell tumor. The resections were classified according to the system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. A variety of reconstructive procedures were performed after resection of the tumor, with the choice of procedure depending on the type of resection and the needs of the patient. The functional results were described and graded quantitatively according to the functional rating system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. The average duration of follow-up was 5.3 years (median, 4.6 years) for the forty-seven patients who were still alive at the time of the latest follow-up examination. Eight patients died of disease and two others died of unrelated malignant tumors an average of 1.8 years postoperatively. The resection of the tumor was classified as wide in forty of the fifty-three patients who had a sarcoma and as marginal in thirteen; four patients had local recurrence (two, after a wide resection, and two, after a marginal resection). One of the four patients who had a giant-cell tumor had local recurrence. The functional results were related to the type of resection and the method of skeletal reconstruction. After resection of the entire scapula and the proximal aspect of the humerus, reconstruction with a spacer frequently resulted in asymptomatic superior subluxation of the implant and poor function of the shoulder. After extra-articular resection of the glenoid cavity and the proximal aspect of the humerus with loss of the abductor mechanism, osseous arthrodesis resulted in good function that was superior to that found after reconstruction with a spacer or a proximal humeral replacement prosthesis. Our preferred method to achieve fusion was insertion of an intercalary allograft and a vascularized fibular graft. However, the allograft fractured in three of four patients in whom primary fusion had been obtained with this technique. An osteoarticular allograft inserted after intra-articular resection of the proximal aspect of the humerus and preservation of the abductor mechanism provided good function that was superior to that found after reconstruction with a proximal humeral replacement prosthesis, which produced symptomatic instability that led to a secondary arthrodesis in some patients. However, subchondral fracture and collapse of the osteoarticular allograft occurred in four of eight patients by the time of the latest follow-up examination. The results of all methods of reconstruction were satisfactory with regard to pain, emotional acceptance, and manual dexterity. We believe that the use of a method of reconstruction that is appropriate with regard to the needs of the patient and preoperative counseling regarding the expected functional level and restrictions of activity are critical for a high level of postoperative satisfaction.","  Hyper-redundant Robotic Manipulators (HRMs) offer great dexterity and

        Sentence A: The intermediate functional results were assessed for fifty-seven patients who had had a limb-salvage procedure for treatment of a tumor of the shoulder girdle region at our institution from 1980 through 1990. Fifty-three patients had a malignant bone tumor (a sarcoma) and four had an extensive giant-cell tumor. The resections were classified according to the system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. A variety of reconstructive procedures were performed after resection of the tumor, with the choice of procedure depending on the type of resection and the needs of the patient. The functional results were described and graded quantitatively according to the functional rating system of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. The average duration of follow-up was 5.3 years (median, 4.6 years) for the forty-seven patients who were still alive at the time of the latest follow-up examination. Eight patients died of disease and two others died of unrelated malignant tumors an average of 1.8 years postoperatively. The resection of the tumor was classified as wide in forty of the fifty-three patients who had a sarcoma and as marginal in thirteen; four patients had local recurrence (two, after a wide resection, and two, after a marginal resection). One of the four patients who had a giant-cell tumor had local recurrence. The functional results were related to the type of resection and the method of skeletal reconstruction. After resection of the entire scapula and the proximal aspect of the humerus, reconstruction with a spacer frequently resulted in asymptomatic superior subluxation of the implant and poor function of the shoulder. After extra-articular resection of the glenoid cavity and the proximal aspect of the humerus with loss of the abductor mechanism, osseous arthrodesis resulted in good function that was superior to that found after reconstruction with a spacer or a proximal humeral replacement prosthesis. Our preferred method to achieve fusion was insertion of an intercalary allograft and a vascularized fibular graft. However, the allograft fractured in three of four patients in whom primary fusion had been obtained with this technique. An osteoarticular allograft inserted after intra-articular resection of the proximal aspect of the humerus and preservation of the abductor mechanism provided good function that was superior to that found after reconstruction with a proximal humeral replacement prosthesis, which produced symptomatic instability that led to a secondary arthrodesis in some patients. However, subchondral fracture and collapse of the osteoarticular allograft occurred in four of eight patients by the time of the latest follow-up examination. The results of all methods of reconstruction were satisfactory with regard to pain, emotional acceptance, and manual dexterity. We believe that the use of a method of reconstruction that is appropriate with regard to the needs of the patient and preoperative counseling regarding the expected functional level and restrictions of activity are critical for a high level of postoperative satisfaction.
        Sentence B:   Hyper-redundant Robotic Manipulators (HRMs) offer great dexterity and
flexibility of operation, but solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) is challenging.
In this work, we introduce VO-FABRIK, an algorithm combining Forward and
Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) for repeatable deterministic IK
computation, and an approach inspired from velocity obstacles to perform path
planning under collision and joint limits constraints. We show preliminary
results on an industrial HRM with 19 actuated joints. Our algorithm achieves
good performance where a state-of-the-art IK solver fails.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the functional results of a surgical procedure for patients with tumors in the shoulder girdle region. The context suggests that the term refers to the patients' ability to perform manual tasks, such as using their hands and arms, with minimal difficulty or discomfort. The sentence also mentions that the patients underwent various reconstructive procedures after resection of the tumor, which may have affected their dexterity.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the capabilities of a hyper-redundant robotic manipulator. The term is used to convey the idea that the manipulator has a high degree of flexibility and adaptability in its movements. The sentence also mentions that solving inverse kinematics is challenging, which suggests that the term ""dexterity"" is being used to refer to the manipulator's ability to perform complex motions with precision.

Based on these contexts, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term refers to the patients' ability to perform manual tasks, while in Sentence B, it refers to the manipulator's ability to perform complex motions with precision. Therefore, I would label the usage of the term ""dexterity"" in Sentence B as ""Changed""."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the motor competence of children aged between six years and 11 years 10 months. The context suggests that the term refers to the children's manual dexterity, or their ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills. The sentence also mentions that the children's motor performance is related to their mothers' serum thyroid hormone levels.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context. It refers to the surgical techniques used in lobectomy, specifically the improved optics, increased dexterity of the instruments, and better ergonomics. The term is used to describe the advantages of the da Vinci Si and da Vinci Xi platforms in comparison to VATS.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between the two timestamps. In Sentence A, the term refers to the children's fine motor skills, while in Sentence B, it refers to the surgical techniques used in lobectomy. Therefore, I have labeled this term as ""Changed""."

        Reasoning:

        In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the recovery of functional abilities after a stroke. The context suggests that the term is used to indicate the ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills, such as gait or movement. The sentence also highlights the importance of rehabilitation in modulating the logistic pattern of recovery. In this context, ""dexterity"" connotes a sense of precision and coordination.

        In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context to describe the impact of protective equipment on healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sentence suggests that the equipment hinders the workers' ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills, such as surgical procedures. In this context, ""dexterity"" connotes a sense of limitation or restriction.

        Therefore, the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has changed between the two sentences, shifting from a sense of recovery and precision to a sense of limitation and restriction. As a result, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

The meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" is used to describe the assessment of technical performance in a medical context, specifically in relation to laparoscopic surgical simulation. In this context, ""dexterity"" implies a high level of skill and precision required for the task at hand.

In Sentence B, ""dexterity"" is used to describe motor impairments in individuals who have used the recreational drug ""ecstasy"" or MDMA. In this context, ""dexterity"" implies a loss of coordination, clumsiness, or difficulty with fine motor movements. This shift in meaning suggests that the word ""dexterity"" has undergone semantic drift, as its original meaning in Sentence A has been replaced by a new meaning in Sentence B.

Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this example."

        Explanation:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability of a drug to improve motor performance tests in patients with Huntington's chorea. The context suggests that the term refers to the patient's ability to perform specific motor tasks, such as walking or writing. However, in Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context to describe the adaptability and flexibility of soft robotic systems. In this context, the term ""dexterity"" refers to the ability of the robot to perform tasks with precision and accuracy, without being rigid or inflexible.

Based on these differences in context and meaning, it can be argued that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe a specific aspect of motor function, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe a broader aspect of robot performance. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate to indicate that the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted over time."

Explanation:
In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" refers to the manual skill and coordination of the hands to perform tasks such as grasping, manipulating, and typing. However, in Sentence B, ""dexterity"" is used to describe the practical laparoscopic training in gynecological endoscopy. The term has shifted its meaning to focus more on the technical skills required for a specific medical procedure. This change in meaning indicates semantic drift, and therefore the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."
50,Dexterity,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether children with congenital hemiplegia show abnormal hand function on the non-hemiplegic side and whether this, if present, can be related to the type and extent of brain lesions on MRI. Twenty-two children with congenital hemiplegia of age ranging between 4.8 and 12.3 years, were assessed with a clinical and MRI assessment. Clinical assessment included a structured neurological examination, assessment of hand grips and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children which also includes one item assessing speed and accuracy in each hand. The results showed that 64% of the children studied showed some degree of functional impairment of the non-hemiplegic hand. Manual dexterity 1 from the Movement ABC was, in our experience, a more sensitive tool to detect minor functional abnormalities than the evaluation of hand grips. The severity of the impairment on the non-hemiplegic side was not significantly related to the severity of impairment in the hemiplegic hand (p > 0.05). In contrast, a significant association was found with the site of lesions as hand function in the non-hemiplegic hand was always normal in children with unilateral lesion and abnormal in the ones with bilateral parenchymal lesions (p < 0.05). Children with predominantly unilateral lesions but with bilateral ventricular dilatation or periventricular changes showed more variable results.","  Humans rely on touch and tactile sensing for a lot of dexterous manipulation
tasks. Our tactile sensing provides us with a lot of information regarding
contact formations as well as geometric information about objects during any
interaction. With this motivation, vision-based tactile sensors are being
widely used for various robotic perception and control tasks. In this paper, we
present a method for interactive perception using vision-based tactile sensors
for a part mating task, where a robot can use tactile sensors and a feedback
mechanism using a particle filter to incrementally improve its estimate of
objects (pegs and holes) that fit together. To do this, we first train a deep
neural network that makes use of tactile images to predict the probabilistic
correspondence between arbitrarily shaped objects that fit together. The

        Sentence A: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether children with congenital hemiplegia show abnormal hand function on the non-hemiplegic side and whether this, if present, can be related to the type and extent of brain lesions on MRI. Twenty-two children with congenital hemiplegia of age ranging between 4.8 and 12.3 years, were assessed with a clinical and MRI assessment. Clinical assessment included a structured neurological examination, assessment of hand grips and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children which also includes one item assessing speed and accuracy in each hand. The results showed that 64% of the children studied showed some degree of functional impairment of the non-hemiplegic hand. Manual dexterity 1 from the Movement ABC was, in our experience, a more sensitive tool to detect minor functional abnormalities than the evaluation of hand grips. The severity of the impairment on the non-hemiplegic side was not significantly related to the severity of impairment in the hemiplegic hand (p > 0.05). In contrast, a significant association was found with the site of lesions as hand function in the non-hemiplegic hand was always normal in children with unilateral lesion and abnormal in the ones with bilateral parenchymal lesions (p < 0.05). Children with predominantly unilateral lesions but with bilateral ventricular dilatation or periventricular changes showed more variable results.
        Sentence B:   Humans rely on touch and tactile sensing for a lot of dexterous manipulation
tasks. Our tactile sensing provides us with a lot of information regarding
contact formations as well as geometric information about objects during any
interaction. With this motivation, vision-based tactile sensors are being
widely used for various robotic perception and control tasks. In this paper, we
present a method for interactive perception using vision-based tactile sensors
for a part mating task, where a robot can use tactile sensors and a feedback
mechanism using a particle filter to incrementally improve its estimate of
objects (pegs and holes) that fit together. To do this, we first train a deep
neural network that makes use of tactile images to predict the probabilistic
correspondence between arbitrarily shaped objects that fit together. The
trained model is used to design a particle filter which is used twofold. First,
given one partial (or non-unique) observation of the hole, it incrementally
improves the estimate of the correct peg by sampling more tactile observations.
Second, it selects the next action for the robot to sample the next touch (and
thus image) which results in maximum uncertainty reduction to minimize the
number of interactions during the perception task. We evaluate our method on
several part-mating tasks with novel objects using a robot equipped with a

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of evaluating the hand function of children with congenital hemiplegia. The sentence highlights the impairment in the non-hemiplegic side of the hand, which suggests that the term ""dexterity"" in this context refers to the ability to perform precise movements with the hand.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, referring to the ability to manipulate objects through touch and tactile sensing. The sentence highlights the importance of vision-based tactile sensors for interactive perception tasks, such as part mating. The term ""dexterity"" in this context refers to the ability to perform manipulations with precision and accuracy, using both vision and tactile sensing.

Based on these contexts, it is clear that the meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term refers to the ability to perform precise movements with the hand, while in Sentence B, it refers to the ability to perform manipulations with precision and accuracy using both vision and tactile sensing. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity. The sentence suggests that the ability to perform complex tasks is related to hemispheric asymmetry of sensory-motor control, with the left hemisphere being more involved in tasks that require proximal steadiness and distal dexterity. In this context, ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to perform precise and coordinated movements, which is critical for tasks that require fine motor skills.

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of tactile sensation and hand function. The sentence highlights the importance of the radial and ulnar thumb digital nerves in providing sensation and dexterity to the hand. In this context, ""dexterity"" refers to the ability to manipulate objects with precision and dexterity, which is critical for everyday activities such as grasping and manipulating objects.

Comparing the two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted. In Sentence A, the term refers to the ability to perform complex motor tasks, while in Sentence B, it refers to the ability to manipulate objects with precision and dexterity. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

Reasoning: The meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted in Sentence B compared to Sentence A.

The meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the enhancement of robotic capabilities, particularly in the context of remote surgery. The focus is on the technical aspect of the technology, and the word is used to convey the idea of precision and accuracy.

In Sentence B, the word is used in a completely different context, focusing on the anatomy of the thumb and its role in manual dexterity. The word is used to describe the intricate soft-tissue anatomy of the thumb and the ligaments responsible for stabilizing the joints. The focus is on the functional aspect of the thumb, and the word is used to convey the idea of precision and dexterity in a different sense.

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability to access medications, which suggests a more nuanced understanding of the term than in Sentence B. In Sentence B, ""dexterity"" is used solely to describe hand movements, with no mention of the ability to access medications. This suggests that the term ""dexterity"" has shifted its meaning over time, becoming more focused on fine motor skills rather than the broader concept of manual dexterity.

56,Dexterity,"Hand function decreases with age in both men and women, especially after the age of 65 years. A review is presented of anatomical and physiological changes in the aging hand. The age-related changes in prehension patterns (grip and pinch strength) and hand dexterity in the elderly population are considered. Deterioration in hand function in the elderly population is, to a large degree, secondary to age-related degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal, vascular, and nervous systems. Deterioration of hand function in elderly adults is a combination of local structural changes (joints, muscle, tendon, bone, nerve and receptors, blood supply, skin, and fingernails) and more distant changes in neural control. These age-related changes are often accompanied by underlying pathological conditions (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatic arthritis, and Parkinson's disease) that are common in the elderly population. Assessment of hand function and prehension patterns is needed in order to determine specific treatment approaches.","  Observation of redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)
is challenging due to contamination from the bright foreground sources that
exceed the signal by several orders of magnitude. The removal of this very high
foreground relies on accurate calibration to keep the intrinsic property of the
foreground with frequency. Commonly employed calibration techniques for these
experiments are the sky model-based and the redundant baseline-based
calibration approaches. However, the sky model-based and redundant
baseline-based calibration methods could suffer from sky-modeling error and
array redundancy imperfection issues, respectively. In this work, we introduce
the hybrid correlation calibration (""CorrCal"") scheme, which aims to bridge the
gap between redundant and sky-based calibration by relaxing redundancy of the
array and including sky information into the calibration formalisms. We
demonstrate the slight improvement of power spectra, about $-6\%$ deviation at
the bin right on the horizon limit of the foreground wedge-like structure,
relative to the power spectra before the implementation of ""CorrCal"" to the
data from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER)
experiment, which was otherwise calibrated using redundant baseline
calibration. This small improvement of the foreground power spectra around the
wedge limit could be suggestive of reduced spectral structure in the data after
""CorrCal"" calibration, which lays the foundation for future improvement of the
calibration algorithm and implementation method.

Deterioration in hand function in the elderly population is, to a large degree, secondary to age-related degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal, vascular, and nervous systems. Deterioration of hand function in elderly adults is a combination of local structural changes (joints, muscle, tendon, bone, nerve and receptors, blood supply, skin, and fingernails) and more distant changes in neural control. These age-related changes are often accompanied by underlying pathological conditions (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatic arthritis, and Parkinson's disease) that are common in the elderly population. Assessment of hand function and prehension patterns is needed in order to determine specific treatment approaches.
        Sentence B:   Observation of redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)
is challenging due to contamination from the bright foreground sources that
exceed the signal by several orders of magnitude. The removal of this very high
foreground relies on accurate calibration to keep the intrinsic property of the
foreground with frequency. Commonly employed calibration techniques for these
experiments are the sky model-based and the redundant baseline-based
calibration approaches. However, the sky model-based and redundant
baseline-based calibration methods could suffer from sky-modeling error and
array redundancy imperfection issues, respectively. In this work, we introduce
the hybrid correlation calibration (""CorrCal"") scheme, which aims to bridge the
gap between redundant and sky-based calibration by relaxing redundancy of the
array and including sky information into the calibration formalisms. We
demonstrate the slight improvement of power spectra, about $-6\%$ deviation at
the bin right on the horizon limit of the foreground wedge-like structure,
relative to the power spectra before the implementation of ""CorrCal"" to the
data from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER)
experiment, which was otherwise calibrated using redundant baseline
calibration. This small improvement of the foreground power spectra around the
wedge limit could be suggestive of reduced spectral structure in the data after
""CorrCal"" calibration, which lays the foundation for future improvement of the
calibration algorithm and implementation method.

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the decline in hand function with age, specifically in the elderly population. The context suggests that the term has a negative connotation, as the decline in hand function is associated with age-related degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal, vascular, and nervous systems.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The term has a different meaning and connotation, as it is used to describe the ability to measure the signal accurately due to the presence of bright foreground sources. The context suggests that the term has a positive connotation, as the ability to measure the signal accurately is crucial for understanding the EoR.

Based on these two contexts, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning and connotation between the two sentences. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Sixty-eight patients experienced 116 episodes of peritonitis, i.e., one episode every 12.9 patient months (pt mo). Patients that had used the SCD for their entire CAPD experience had a significantly lower peritonitis rate (1/15.2 pt mo) compared to patients who had used other CAPD systems (1/10.1 pt mo). Peritonitis rates for diabetic study patients or patients with impaired vision and/or dexterity were not significantly greater than non-diabetic or non-impaired study patients.

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability of patients to perform CAPD, specifically their ability to handle the SCD 210 patient assist device. The sentence highlights the importance of dexterity in CAPD, as patients who have used the device for their entire CAPD experience have a significantly lower peritonitis rate compared to those who have used other CAPD systems. In this context, the word ""dexterity"" has a positive connotation, implying that the ability to handle the device is crucial for successful CAPD.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the ability of an expert to perform a task through imitation learning. The sentence highlights the importance of learning through observation, without access to reward signals from environments. The word ""dexterity"" has a different connotation in this context, implying the ability to perform a task with precision and skill.

Based on these two contexts, it is clear that the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted from a focus on CAPD-related skills to a more general ability to perform tasks with precision and skill. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of occupational diseases of the locomotor system in musicians. The sentence highlights the unique demands of instrumental playing, such as isolation of the fingers, unequal finger movements, and simultaneous movements in contrary directions. The sentence also mentions the importance of manual preconditions in professional level performance. The term ""dexterity"" connotes manual dexterity, coordination, and precision.

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of machine learning and the training of large-scale deep neural network models. The sentence discusses the use of stochastic rounding to train tall and skinny matrices, and how this technique implicitly regularizes the matrices so that the rounded versions have full column rank. The term ""dexterity"" in this sentence connotes computational dexterity, efficiency, and scalability.

Comparing the two sentences, it is evident that the meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe manual dexterity and preconditions in professional musicians. In Sentence B, the term is used to describe computational dexterity and the ability to train large-scale deep neural network models efficiently. The two sentences convey different meanings and connotations of the term ""dexterity,"" indicating semantic drift. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Adults with nLUTD have competing risk factors, including previous operations, obesity, poor nutritional status, complex living arrangements, impaired dexterity/paralysis, and impaired executive and cognitive function. Complications are common in this subgroup of patients requiring enduring commitments from surgeons, patients, and their caretakers.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of evaluating the learning curve of a new surgical technique, specifically robot-assisted laparoscopic suture placement. The sentence highlights the potential benefits of this technique, including increased dexterity and improved laparoscopic reconstructive procedures. In this context, the term ""dexterity"" implies a high level of manual dexterity and precision required for the task at hand.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, specifically in relation to patients with neurogenic urinary tract dysfunction (nLUTD). Here, the term implies a different level of meaning, as the sentence highlights the challenges faced by these patients, including impaired dexterity/paralysis, and the need for specialized surgical interventions. In this context, the term ""dexterity"" implies a reduced level of manual dexterity or mobility, likely due to neurological damage or disorder.

Therefore, based on the different contexts and meanings attributed to the term ""dexterity"" in Sentences A and B, it can be concluded that semantic drift has occurred in the meaning of this term. The term has shifted from implying high manual dexterity and precision in Sentence A to implying reduced manual dexterity or mobility in Sentence B."

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability of painters to perform tasks that require precision and accuracy. The sentence suggests that exposure to work can lead to a significant deterioration of performance on various tasks, including reaction time, tweezers dexterity, hand precision, and memory. The word ""dexterity"" carries a negative connotation in this context, implying a decline in ability due to work-related stress.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of functional MRI to assess brain activation and connectivity following stroke. The sentence suggests that there is no significant difference in the BOLD response to motor tasks in the ipsilesional hemisphere between healthy and affected hemispheres. The word ""dexterity"" carries a neutral connotation in this context, as it refers to the ability to perform tasks without any significant impairment.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted. In Sentence A, the word carries a negative connotation, implying a decline in ability due to work-related stress. In Sentence B, the word carries a neutral connotation, with no implication of decline or impairment. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

The meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has changed significantly between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the ability to play a keyboard or to perform a specific task (e.g., finger pinch meter, range of motion) with precision and skill. In contrast, in Sentence B, the word is used to describe a surgical skill (i.e., conjunctival closure) and is associated with the idea of precision and accuracy in a medical context.

In Sentence A, the target word is used in a more general context, with no explicit medical connotations. However, the sentence suggests that the ability to play a keyboard or perform a specific task is beneficial for older adults with hand osteoarthritis, as it can improve their occupational therapy measures and reduce their arthritic discomfort.

In Sentence B, the target word is used in a very different context, with a strong emphasis on medical precision and skill. The sentence describes the importance of conjunctival closure in strabismus surgery and highlights the need for residents to develop this skill through supervised teaching and practice.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the meaning of the target word ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between Sentence A and Sentence B. Therefore, I would label the word as having undergone semantic drift."

        Explanation:

        In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of evaluating the cognitive and motor performance of preschool children. The sentence suggests that children who were born prematurely have lower scores on tests of visuospatial and visuomotor abilities, but their manual dexterity is only slightly lower compared to their peers who were born at full-term. This implies that the term ""dexterity"" in this context refers to the ability to perform manual tasks, such as fine motor skills, with precision and accuracy.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, where it refers to the effect of caffeine on cognitive and motor performance in older adults. The sentence suggests that caffeine ingestion can enhance functional performance, manual dexterity, and readiness to invest effort in older adults. This implies that the term ""dexterity"" in this context refers to the ability to perform physical tasks with ease and efficiency, possibly due to the stimulant effects of caffeine.

Comparing the two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between the two timestamps. In Sentence A, the term refers to fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination in preschool children, while in Sentence B, it refers to physical performance and mobility in older adults.

Using minimally invasive techniques with miniature robotic platforms potentially offers significant clinical benefits. A miniature robot platform has been designed to perform advanced laparoscopic surgery with speed, dexterity, and tissue-handling capabilities comparable to standard laparoscopic instruments working through trocars. The robotic platform includes a dexterous in vivo robot and a remote surgeon interface console. For this study, a standard laparoscope was mounted to the robot to provide vision and lighting capabilities. In addition, multiple robots could be inserted through a single incision rather than the traditional use of four or five different ports. These additional robots could provide capabilities such as tissue retraction and supplementary visualization or lighting. The efficacy of this robot has been demonstrated in a nonsurvival cholecystectomy in a porcine model. The procedure was performed through a single large transabdominal incision, with supplementary retraction being provided by standard laparoscopic tools.

The three variables that determined whether a second puncture was needed, in order of importance, were number and size of the stones, with second tracts needed in patients with multiple stones and staghorn calculi; anatomical variations of the renal collecting system itself, with bifid systems the most significant anatomic variation; and the dexterity of the radiologist in performing the puncture and the ability of the urologist to extract the stone. Second tracts were needed more frequently in patients who presented with stones in both the lower and middle poles of the collecting systems.
        Sentence B: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a miniature robot to perform complex, single-incision, minimal access surgery. Instrument positioning and lack of triangulation complicate single-incision laparoscopic surgery, and open surgical procedures are highly invasive. Using minimally invasive techniques with miniature robotic platforms potentially offers significant clinical benefits. A miniature robot platform has been designed to perform advanced laparoscopic surgery with speed, dexterity, and tissue-handling capabilities comparable to standard laparoscopic instruments working through trocars. The robotic platform includes a dexterous in vivo robot and a remote surgeon interface console. For this study, a standard laparoscope was mounted to the robot to provide vision and lighting capabilities. In addition, multiple robots could be inserted through a single incision rather than the traditional use of four or five different ports. These additional robots could provide capabilities such as tissue retraction and supplementary visualization or lighting. The efficacy of this robot has been demonstrated in a nonsurvival cholecystectomy in a porcine model. The procedure was performed through a single large transabdominal incision, with supplementary retraction being provided by standard laparoscopic tools. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a dexterous robot platform for performing single-incision, advanced laparoscopic surgery.

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability of a radiologist to perform a puncture and an urologist to extract a stone. The term connotes a high level of skill and precision, which was likely important in the context of minimally invasive surgery in 2000.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, describing the capabilities of a miniature robot platform. The term connotes a high level of precision and dexterity in the robot's movements, which is relevant in the context of advanced laparoscopic surgery.

Therefore, the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted between the two sentences, indicating semantic drift has occurred."
69,Dexterity,"The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the frequency and site of glove perforation during cardiac surgical procedures. Over a period of six months, gloves from 206 surgical team members were collected at the conclusion of surgery. All cases of known perforations were eliminated from the study.

We found that 73% of the punctures occurred in one of four contiguous locations on the glove: the radial side of the index finger (28%), the radial side of the thumb (21%), the palmar side of the index (14%), and the palmar side of the thumb (10%). Therefore, we recommend glove reinforcement on these locations that would provide better protection against transmission of infectious agents.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the frequency and site of glove perforation during cardiac surgical procedures. The context suggests that the term refers to the ability to perform tasks with precision and skill, particularly in the hand and fingers. However, in Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the motor function of patients after stroke. The context suggests that the term now refers to the ability to perform manual tasks, including those that require fine motor skills and precision.

In Sentence A, the meaning of ""dexterity"" is focused on the physical aspect of hand function, specifically the ability to perform tasks that require manual dexterity. In contrast, in Sentence B, the meaning of ""dexterity"" is more focused on the cognitive aspect of motor function, specifically the ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills and precision. Therefore, it can be argued that the meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted from a primarily physical to a primarily cognitive concept. This change in meaning could be considered semantic drift.

Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

Ten young healthy volunteers participated in this randomized, cross-over study with three phases at least two days apart. Five cm of 2% glyceryl trinitrate ointment, 10% nicotinic acid ointment or placebo ointment was applied on the back of each subject's both hands 15 min. before the 7 min. cold exposure. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured prior to, during and after the cold exposure. In addition, the effect of cold on hand dexterity was evaluated by the Purdue pegboard test and the subjects assessed the pain in their hands during the cold exposure. Pretreatment with glyceryl trinitrate ointment counteracted the cold-induced haemodynamic response, as evidenced by a significantly (P < 0.05) smaller mean increase in the systolic blood pressure from the baseline compared with placebo. In contrast, the cold-induced increase in the systolic blood pressure observed after pretreatment with nicotinic acid ointment did not differ from placebo. Both glyceryl trinitrate and nicotinic acid alleviated the cold-induced pain, but neither of them prevented the deterioration of hand dexterity. In conclusion, the haemodynamic response provoked by a brief cold exposure could to some extent be counteracted by pretreatment with glyceryl trinitrate ointment, but not with nicotinic acid ointment, compared with placebo.","Constraint-induced (CI) movement therapy is a promising therapy for improving upper limb function in adults after stroke.

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""hand dexterity"" is used to describe the ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills, such as using tools or typing. The context suggests that the term refers to the ability to perform precise movements with the hands. However, in Sentence B, the term ""movement efficiency"" is used instead of ""hand dexterity"". This suggests that the meaning of the term has shifted to encompass a broader range of movements, including larger movements that require whole-body coordination rather than just fine motor skills. Therefore, semantic drift has occurred."

Of the 30 individuals included in this study 16 were wearing a 'behind the ear' type of hearing aid and the rest had an 'in the ear' type of hearing aid. A comparison is made between the two types of heariing aids.

Compared to the typically developing children, children with esotropia showed significantly poorer motor performances, especially in manual dexterity and ball skills, and significantly poorer and slower performance on the visual spatial cognitive tasks. Especially the girls treated for infantile esotropia needed more time to mentally rotate the pictures of the PRT correctly.

In this study, the manual dexterity of 30 individuals between 65 and 85 years using a hearing aid was tested by the Purdue pegboard test and the result was compared to the benefit obtained from the use of a hearing aid assessed by a questionnaire. Of the 30 individuals included in this study 16 were wearing a 'behind the ear' type of hearing aid and the rest had an 'in the ear' type of hearing aid. A comparison is made between the two types of heariing aids. The results demonstrate a correlation between manual dexterity and successful use of a hearing aid when all the 30 individuals were considered as a single group. However, no such correlation was found for 'in the ear' group when they were analysed separately.
        Sentence B: While many studies have investigated links between motor and visual spatial cognitive abilities in typically developing children, only a few studies have tested this link among children with innate handicaps. Therefore, we assessed motor abilities (using the M-ABC-2) and visual spatial cognitive skills (using the Block Design subtest of the WPPSI-III and a picture mental rotation task, PRT) of 5-7 year old typically developing children (n= 17) and same-aged children with severe deficits in stereopsis due to infantile esotropia (n= 17). Compared to the typically developing children, children with esotropia showed significantly poorer motor performances, especially in manual dexterity and ball skills, and significantly poorer and slower performance on the visual spatial cognitive tasks. Especially the girls treated for infantile esotropia needed more time to mentally rotate the pictures of the PRT correctly. Overall, this study showed that perceptual, motor and cognitive processes are interconnected and that children treated for infantile esotropia had an increased risk of motor and visual spatial cognitive deficits.

        ###Answer
        1. Changed

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of manual dexterity, specifically the fine dexterity of the hand. The sentence suggests that manual dexterity is important for the successful use of a hearing aid. In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, referring to visual spatial cognitive abilities, specifically the ability to mentally rotate pictures. The sentence suggests that children with severe deficits in stereopsis due to infantile esotropia have poorer visual spatial cognitive skills, especially among girls.

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" has a positive connotation, as it is associated with the successful use of a hearing aid. In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" has a different connotation, as it is associated with visual spatial cognitive skills. The meaning of the term has shifted from manual dexterity to visual spatial cognitive abilities. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        Explanation:

The target word ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A (2000) and Sentence B (2020). In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the advancements in imaging technologies, specifically the development of virtual reality imaging. The focus is on the technical capabilities of the imaging equipment. In contrast, in Sentence B, the word is used to describe the design of a catheter for navigational bronchoscopy. The focus is on the ability of the catheter to adapt to the surrounding anatomy during navigation.

In Sentence A, the meaning of ""dexterity"" is related to the technical capabilities of the imaging equipment, emphasizing the ability to simulate conventional endoscopy. In Sentence B, the meaning of ""dexterity"" is related to the design of the catheter, emphasizing the ability to adapt to the surrounding anatomy during navigation. These two meanings are distinct and suggest a shift in focus from technical capabilities to design and adaptability. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

The test of motor impairment (TOMI) and the vocabulary subscale of the Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence (WPPSI) were administered to 152 of the index cohort and 144 control children of the same age in the same class at school. Twelve of the cohort had cerebral palsy, but eight of these were in mainstream schools. The index group scored significantly higher on both the TOMI and the WPPSI subscale compared with the controls. The index cases were subdivided on the basis of their neonatal ultrasound scans into four groups: group 1, consistently normal; group 2, 'prolonged flare'; group 3, germinal matrix haemorrhage-intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH-IVH), without parenchymal haemorrhage, but no evidence of prolonged flare; and group 4, both GMH-IVH and prolonged flare. The group of index children with consistently normal ultrasound scans had a higher TOMI and lower WPPSI compared with their controls. There was a statistically significant increase in the TOMI subscore 1 (manual dexterity) in group 4 infants compared with group 1, but not differences between the other groups. Regression analysis suggests that neither prolonged flare nor GMH-IVH has an important individual contribution to the variation, but the low birth weight does have a significant relationship with motor impairment.

        ###Answer
        1. Changed

        Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of neonatal ultrasound examinations to describe the manual dexterity of infants. The sentence highlights the importance of motor impairment in very low birth weight infants, with a focus on the impact of low birth weight. The term ""dexterity"" carries a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of coordination or clumsiness.

In Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the impact of sleep deprivation on medical students and residents. The sentence highlights the importance of sleep for maintaining physical and mental health, and the negative consequences of sleep deprivation. The term ""dexterity"" carries a different connotation in this sentence, suggesting a loss of coordination or dexterity due to sleep deprivation.

Based on these contexts, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe a specific aspect of neonatal development and the impact of low birth weight, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe the broader impact of sleep deprivation on physical and mental health. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate to indicate that the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between these two sentences."

        Reasoning:

        In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability to perform a specific task, specifically the use of endoscopes in airway management. The context suggests that the term refers to the manual dexterity and coordination required to perform the task effectively. However, in Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, to describe the precision and visualization of a medical procedure. In this sentence, the term refers to the technical skill and accuracy required to perform the procedure successfully.

        Therefore, it can be inferred that the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted between the two sentences, moving from a focus on manual dexterity to a focus on technical skill and precision. This constitutes semantic drift, and the label ""Changed"" is therefore appropriate."

Reasoning: The meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has changed between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the ability to perform manual tasks with precision and skill, particularly in the context of surgical skill. In Sentence B, the word is used to describe the ability to perform cognitive tasks with speed and accuracy, particularly in the context of neurophysiological data. The shift in meaning is significant, as the word is being used in a different context and with a different connotation. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."
80,Dexterity,"Laparoscopic surgery has become increasingly popular over the last decade. However, this surgical technique has a number of limitations. It is difficult to work in a three-dimensional space while viewing a two-dimensional monitor, long instruments amplify natural tremor, and traditional instruments have limited mobility due to few degrees of freedom. Robot-assisted surgery has been developed in response to these limitations. A three-dimensional viewer allows the surgeon to operate in a realistic environment, natural tremor is eliminated by translating the surgeon's hand motions to robotic movements, and the robotic surgical instruments are designed to have the same dexterity as a human wrist. We describe a case of robot-assisted laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and discuss the anesthetic issues associated with this new surgical technique. In addition to the anesthetic issues associated with traditional laparoscopic surgery, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery presents some unique challenges.","Our ability to manipulate objects dexterously relies fundamentally on sensory signals originating from the hand. To restore motor function with upper-limb neuroprostheses requires that somatosensory feedback be provided to the tetraplegic patient or amputee. Given the complexity of state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and, thus, the huge state space they can traverse, it is desirable to minimize the need for the patient to learn associations between events impinging on the limb and arbitrary sensations. Accordingly, we have developed approaches to intuitively convey sensory information that is critical for object manipulation--information about contact location, pressure, and timing--through intracortical microstimulation of primary somatosensory cortex. In experiments with nonhuman primates, we show that we can elicit percepts that are projected to a localized patch of skin and that track the pressure exerted on the skin. In a real-time application, we demonstrate that animals can perform a tactile discrimination task equally well whether mechanical stimuli are delivered to their native fingers or to a prosthetic one. Finally, we propose that the timing of contact events can be signaled through phasic intracortical microstimulation at the onset and offset of object contact that mimics the ubiquitous on and off responses observed in primary somatosensory cortex to complement slowly varying pressure-related feedback. We anticipate that the proposed biomimetic feedback will considerably increase the dexterity and embodiment of upper-limb neuroprostheses and will constitute an important step in restoring touch to individuals who have lost it.","###Task: Identify semantic drift in a target word by comparing its usage in two sentences from different time periods.

        Sentence B: Our ability to manipulate objects dexterously relies fundamentally on sensory signals originating from the hand. To restore motor function with upper-limb neuroprostheses requires that somatosensory feedback be provided to the tetraplegic patient or amputee. Given the complexity of state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and, thus, the huge state space they can traverse, it is desirable to minimize the need for the patient to learn associations between events impinging on the limb and arbitrary sensations. Accordingly, we have developed approaches to intuitively convey sensory information that is critical for object manipulation--information about contact location, pressure, and timing--through intracortical microstimulation of primary somatosensory cortex. In experiments with nonhuman primates, we show that we can elicit percepts that are projected to a localized patch of skin and that track the pressure exerted on the skin. In a real-time application, we demonstrate that animals can perform a tactile discrimination task equally well whether mechanical stimuli are delivered to their native fingers or to a prosthetic one. Finally, we propose that the timing of contact events can be signaled through phasic intracortical microstimulation at the onset and offset of object contact that mimics the ubiquitous on and off responses observed in primary somatosensory cortex to complement slowly varying pressure-related feedback. We anticipate that the proposed biomimetic feedback will considerably increase the dexterity and embodiment of upper-limb neuroprostheses and will constitute an important step in restoring touch to individuals who have lost it.

Reasoning: The meaning of ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, ""dexterity"" refers to the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, particularly the difficulty in manipulating objects in a three-dimensional space while viewing a two-dimensional monitor. In contrast, in Sentence B, ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability to manipulate objects through intracortical microstimulation of primary somatosensory cortex, with a focus on restoring motor function to tetraplegic patients or amputees. These two meanings are not interchangeable, indicating that the term ""dexterity"" has undergone semantic drift."

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ability to perform a specific task, in this case, pushing up from a chair or pushing open a door with the flat palm of the hand. The context suggests that the word is used to convey a sense of precision and control. However, in Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context to describe the ability of a robot to manipulate objects in a precise and controlled manner. The word is used to convey a sense of technical skill and efficiency.

In Sentence A, the meaning of ""dexterity"" is focused on the ability to perform a specific task with precision and control, whereas in Sentence B, the meaning is focused on the ability of a machine to perform a task with technical skill and efficiency. These two meanings are not interchangeable, and therefore, semantic drift has occurred in the meaning of the target word ""dexterity""."

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used in the context of physical exercise interventions to measure the effectiveness of different home-based programs on grip strength and range of motion. The word carries a neutral or even positive connotation in this context, suggesting that the ability to perform physical tasks with ease and precision is important for overall health and well-being.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" takes on a different meaning, as it is used to describe the interventionist's skillfulness in performing cardiovascular procedures. The word carries a positive connotation in this context, suggesting that the interventionist must possess a high level of manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination to perform the procedures successfully.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted significantly over time. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe physical ability, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe technical skill in a medical context. Therefore, I would label this word as ""Changed""."

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the loss of cell loss or reduction in infarct volume in animal models of ischemia.

In Sentence B, the target word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the use of computational biology, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to investigate authorial style and intertextuality in Latin literature. The context suggests that the word refers to the ability of a computer algorithm to identify similarities in a large corpus of texts.

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" has a negative connotation, as it is used to describe the loss of cells following an ischemic event. In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" has a neutral connotation, as it is used to describe the use of algorithms to identify similarities in texts.

The word is used in conjunction with ""training dummies"" and ""surgical skills,"" indicating a focus on the practical application of manual dexterity.

In Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used in a different context, specifically related to the diagnosis, management, and treatment of symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease. The word is used in conjunction with ""innovative strategies,"" ""tools,"" and ""interventions,"" indicating a focus on the development of technological solutions to address cognitive and motor deficits in AD patients.

Based on these contextual differences, it can be argued that the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted from a focus on practical manual skills in Sentence A to a focus on technological innovations in Sentence B. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate to indicate that semantic drift has occurred."
88,Dexterity,"As with standard microsurgical procedures performed at laparotomy, laparoscopic tubal anastomosis requires great dexterity. Handling fine suture materials under magnification to anastomose tubal segments with lumens less than 3 mm in diameter while working with your hands at a distance from the tissue makes these fine movements even more difficult. This is exacerbated by the tremor induced by the fatigue caused by a prolonged laparoscopic procedure and the need for precise control. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of performing laparoscopic tubal anastomosis with robotic assistance in a live porcine model. Two anastomoses were performed on one uterine horn via each of the following techniques: laparoscopy, laparoscopy with robotic assistance, and open microsurgery. Immediate necropsy demonstrated all the anastomoses to be patent. There were no intraoperative complications. Laparoscopic tubal anastomosis was associated with surgeon fatigue and neck, shoulder, and back pain. The surgeons were more comfortable performing the procedure with robotic assistance. The device functioned well and without incident. This acute animal study suggests that robotic assistance in laparoscopic tubal anastomoses is safe and feasible.

However, our understanding of how the effective linking of sequential action phases develops with skill learning is limited. Here, we addressed this issue using a task in which participants applied forces to a handle to move a cursor on a computer screen to successively acquire visual targets.

If the transport phase was initiated prematurely, before the end of the required hold duration, participants had to return to the target to acquire it. The goal was to acquire targets as quickly as possible. Distinct visual and auditory sensory events marked goal completion of each action phase.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used to describe the surgeon's ability to perform laparoscopic tubal anastomosis with precision and control. The context suggests that the term connotes a high level of manual skill and dexterity, as the surgeon must handle fine suture materials and perform precise movements under magnification.

In Sentence B, the term ""manual tasks"" is used to describe a series of actions performed to achieve a goal. The context suggests that the term connotes a wide range of activities that require dexterity and coordination, such as object manipulation and movement.

Based on the context and meaning of the term in each sentence, it is clear that the term ""dexterity"" has shifted in meaning between the two timestamps. In Sentence A, the term connotes a highly specialized form of manual skill, while in Sentence B, the term encompasses a broader range of activities that require dexterity and coordination. Therefore, I have labeled the term as having undergone semantic drift, with the label ""Changed""."

The voice prostheses currently available are often inadequate, particularly for patients with limited manual dexterity. An adaptation of the Cooper-Rand Electronic Speech Aid with a dental retainer, designed by a speech-language pathologist and a hospital dental service, was a useful alternative for two patients who were unable to produce voice due to tracheal cuff inflation. Both patients had neuromotor impairment and one used the device while also on a respirator. The device allowed these patients to verbally communicate to hospital staff and family members.
        Sentence B: Catheterization is the insertion of a hollow flexible tube (called a catheter) to drain the urine from the bladder and is probably one of the oldest urologic procedures, dating back 3000 years. Since 1972, when urologist Dr Jack Lapides described a procedure for performing clean intermittent catheterization, this method of bladder management has become lifesaving for an individual who cannot empty their bladder independently. If the bladder is not emptied regularly, elevated storage pressures can develop which may put the upper tracts at risk of subsequent deterioration. Intermittent catheterization (IC) has become the first-line and preferred method of drainage in patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, as long as dexterity or available caregiver support and body habitus allow access. However, over the past 20 years, an evolution has occurred in the technology of catheters used for IC. But with these advances, so has controversy arisen. This article is a review of the current application of IC, the current technology in catheter material and systems, differences between reusable and one-time, or single-use catheters, the cost benefit of doing IC, and the infectious benefit.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the limited manual ability of a patient who is unable to produce voice due to tracheal cuff inflation. The context suggests that the patient has difficulty performing manual tasks due to neuromotor impairment. In contrast, in Sentence B, the word ""dexterity"" is used to describe the ease of inserting a catheter into the bladder for drainage purposes. The context suggests that the catheter insertion is a straightforward process with minimal difficulty or manual dexterity required.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the meaning of the word ""dexterity"" has shifted from a focus on manual ability and impairment to a focus on the ease and simplicity of a medical procedure. This shift in meaning is indicative of semantic drift."

They offer the features of ease of insertion, simple operation requiring little or no manual dexterity, good intrinsic axial rigidity, and exceptional concealability. The bendability of both devices resembles the twisting of a gooseneck lamp. As they are both mechanical devices, they impart a firmness to the penis at all times, as opposed to the fluid feeling of the hydraulic devices. The mechanical reliability of each model has been good to date, and the simplicity of manipulation has made this class of devices the choice of many impotent patients.","About one hundred years after the publication of Tongŭibogam (1613), a physician at the court YI Suki (1664-?) wrote a medical manuscript titled Yŏksimanpil (Miscellaneous Jottings on Medical Experiences and Tests, 1734).

This paper examines the messages YI Suki in Yŏksimanpil tried to address to his fellow Korean doctors, and by doing so illuminates an aspect of the medicine in the late Chosŏn period. The argument goes that YI Suki wrote Yŏksimanpil as a vehicle for promulgating his professional identity as a bureaucratic physician who belonged to the network of the chung'in technical officials-a group of government technical functionaries in late Chosŏn Korea. Throughout the late Chosŏn period, the chung'in technical officials had been discriminated, institutionally and socioculturally, against the yangban literati, while their promotion to honored higher positions was blocked. It was in the late 17th and early 18th century that a group of chung'in officials tried to secure their sociocultural places for their professional activity, thus bringing to light their social and professional identity in Chosŏn society. A member of the network of the chung'in technical officials in the early 18th century, YI Suki was in an effort to position himself as a doctor somewhere between the medical tradition and the Confucian literary tradition. In these sociocultural contexts, we can see more clearly what YI Suki tried to speak of in his book and the historical meaning of the medical writing Yŏksimanpil. First, the way he practiced medicine was testing and confirming what the received medical textbooks had asserted (Chŭnghŏmkobang). This style of practicing medicine could be viewed as a reflection of the comprehensivity trait of bureaucratic court physicians network YI Suki belonged to. Also this type of practice has the implication that YI Suki himself was a well-versed practitioner following the medical textual tradition, which was closely associated with the medical officials network. The emergence of the practice Chŭnghŏmkobang could be better understood in the backdrop of over 100 years of maturation process of Tongŭibogam in the clinical practices. Second, he formulated the professional identity of physicians only in terms of medical proficiency without recourse to the Confucian literary tradition. In other words, in promoting the social status of medicine, he did not resort to Confucian morality. He instead emphasized his dexterity or resourcefulness in dealing with millions of ever-changing diseases (Imsikwŏnbyŏn ). Conceivably, this way of characterizing his own medical practice-by way of strongly combining the textual tradition and the experiential tradition while keeping distance with the Confucian literary tradition-reflected the complexity of the ambivalent identity of the technical chung'in officials, especially in regard to Confucianism, between Confucian physicians and hereditary doctors. All in all, YI Suki presented himself as an ideal image of the physician, which arguably reflected the sociocultural and academic context of the network of the chung'in technical officials in early 18th century Chosŏn Korea.

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of children with hand dysfunction, where it refers to the ability to perform specific hand functions such as wrist extension and forearm supination. The term is used to describe the improvement in hand function after surgery, with a focus on the practical aspects of hand use. In contrast, in Sentence B, the term ""dexterity"" is used in the context of dental admission, where it refers to the ability to learn unfamiliar psychomotor skills, spatial relationships, and dental techniques needed in preclinical laboratory courses. The term is used to describe the incremental validity of the HAM-Man test of manual dexterity in selecting applicants for dental schools.

In Sentence A, the term ""dexterity"" has a more practical and functional connotation, while in Sentence B, it has a more cognitive and learning-related connotation. Therefore, it can be argued that the meaning of the term ""dexterity"" has shifted from a focus on hand function to a focus on learning and cognition. This shift in meaning constitutes semantic drift, and therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Coeliac angiography revealed the hepatic tumour, which was thought to be malignant. Angiography produced permanent paraplegia as a complication. The tumour was radically removed by an extended right lobectomy. The weight of the operation specimen was 2200 g. Histologically the differential diagnosis layed between benign hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a complication of the operation, specifically the development of a stricture in the common duct. This implies that the term ""paraplegia"" was used in the medical community at that time to refer to a specific medical condition, likely one that affects the spinal cord or nervous system.

In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context, to describe a potential alternative approach to pain management in pancreatic disease. In this context, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to refer to a minimally invasive technique that avoids serious complications such as paraplegia or pneumothorax. This suggests that the term ""paraplegia"" has taken on a different meaning in the medical community since Sentence A was written.

Therefore, it can be concluded that semantic drift has occurred in the term ""paraplegia"" between Sentence A and Sentence B. The term has shifted from a medical condition to a surgical technique, indicating a change in its meaning and connotation over time."

        Explanation:

The target word ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the development of a selection procedure for standing in patients with paraplegia, suggesting that the term is still associated with the classic definition of paralysis of the lower limbs. In Sentence B, the word is used to describe the synthesis of myelin galactolipids containing hydroxy fatty acid (hFA) as the N-acyl chain, which has no direct relation to paralysis. Therefore, the meaning of the target word has significantly shifted between the two timestamps, indicating semantic drift."

        Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a medical condition characterized by paralysis of the lower limbs due to damage to the spinal cord. The sentence highlights the medical details of the patient's condition, including the diagnosis, treatment, and postoperative course. The term ""paraplegia"" is used in a medical context, and its meaning remains relatively consistent throughout the sentence.

In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context. The sentence discusses the quality of life and physical activity of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), which includes paraplegia as a common condition. The sentence highlights the impact of pain from a specific body region on quality of life and physical activity. The term ""paraplegia"" is used in a broader context, encompassing not only the medical condition but also the broader experience of individuals with SCI.

Based on these differences in context and meaning, it can be argued that the term ""paraplegia"" has undergone semantic drift between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term is used primarily in a medical context to describe a specific medical condition. In Sentence B, the term is used more broadly to encompass the broader experience of individuals with SCI, including the impact of pain on quality of life and physical activity. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate to indicate that the meaning of the term ""paraplegia"" has shifted significantly between the two sentences."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a condition where a patient is wheelchair-bound due to spinal cord compression. The context suggests that the patient has suffered significant damage to their spinal cord, which has resulted in permanent paralysis of the lower half of their body. In contrast, in Sentence B, the term ""SPOAN syndrome"" is used to describe a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy, and neuropathy. The context suggests that the patient has a progressive degenerative disorder that affects their spinal cord and optic nerve, leading to muscle weakness and vision loss.

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a medical context to describe a specific condition. However, in Sentence B, the term is used in a different context to describe a broader category of conditions. This suggests that the term ""paraplegia"" has undergone a shift in meaning over time, from a specific medical condition to a broader category of conditions. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a family with a genetic disorder that causes spastic paraplegia, retinitis pigmentosa, mental retardation, and high levels of homocarnosine in the cerebrospinal fluid. In this sentence, the term ""paraplegia"" has a different connotation, suggesting a genetic disorder with a specific set of symptoms. The context suggests that this type of paraplegia is not necessarily debilitating or chronic, but rather a specific set of symptoms associated with a genetic mutation.

        Therefore, the meaning of the term ""paraplegia"" has changed significantly between the two sentences, from a debilitating and chronic condition to a specific set of symptoms associated with a genetic disorder. This indicates semantic drift has occurred."

        1. Changed

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the word ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a spinal cord injury that resulted in death or recovery with local radiation therapy. In Sentence B, the word ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a genetic disorder that affects the spinal cord and causes various systemic and ocular manifestations.

In Sentence A, the word ""paraplegia"" has a negative connotation, as it refers to a serious injury that can result in death or long-term disability. In contrast, in Sentence B, the word ""paraplegia"" has a neutral or even positive connotation, as it refers to a genetic disorder that can be diagnosed and managed with medical interventions.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the meaning of the target word ""paraplegia"" has shifted significantly between the two sentences, indicating semantic drift."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the word ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific medical condition, specifically spastic paraplegia caused by cord compression. The sentence highlights the neurological recovery of the patient after surgery, indicating that the word is used to convey a sense of medical urgency and the need for prompt intervention.

In Sentence B, the word ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context, referring to corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) rather than a medical condition. The sentence discusses the degeneration of these neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The word is used to convey a sense of scientific precision and detail, highlighting the specificity of the study's findings.

Based on these differences in context and meaning, it is clear that the word ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe a specific medical condition, while in Sentence B, it is used to refer to a type of neuron. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."
8,Paraplegia,"The effects of differing strategies of serotonergic manipulation on vascular permeability, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, and the clinical course are evaluated in an experimental model of neoplastic spinal cord compression in rats. Serotonergic manipulations include in vivo inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis by p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA) and in vivo blockage of serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors either by the selective antagonist ketanserin or by cyproheptadine. In paralyzed rats, the ratio of 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) to 5-HT is significantly elevated in the compressed segments, suggesting that 5-HT utilization is increased. Treatment with p-CPA attenuates spinal 5-HT levels by 62.8% +/- 5.1% (mean +/- standard deviation) and reduces the elevated 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio to the normal value. The increased synthesis of PGE2 observed in the compressed cord is unaffected by p-CPA or ketanserin treatment but is markedly attenuated by cyproheptadine. Ketanserin reduces the 10-fold increase in spinal cord permeability observed in paralyzed rats in a clearly dose-related manner. If given at the first sign of neurological dysfunction, ketanserin delays the onset of paraplegia with the 1-mg/kg dose being clearly superior. Cyproheptadine and p-CPA also reduce the increased permeability and protract the course to paraplegia. A comparison of the effect of dexamethasone, indomethacin, cyproheptadine, p-CPA, and ketanserin reveals that they protract the disease course by 48%, 57%, 60%, 64%, and 78%, respectively.

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a neurological condition characterized by weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs. This usage suggests that the term has a specific medical meaning related to neurological function. In contrast, in Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a non-medical condition, specifically a repetitive occurrence of paralysis in a cat. This usage suggests that the term has undergone a significant change in meaning, shifting from a medical term to a non-medical term. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        Explanation:

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a patient who is unable to walk due to a spinal cord injury. The context suggests that the patient has suffered a severe injury that has resulted in permanent damage to the spinal cord, leaving them unable to walk or feel sensation below the level of injury. The term is used in the context of a medical diagnosis, and the meaning is clear and unambiguous.

In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context. The term is now used to describe a complication of a hematologic disorder, specifically extramedullary hematopoiesis. The context suggests that the patient has an excessive production of red blood cells, which can lead to compression of the spinal cord and result in paraparesis or paraplegia. The term is used in a different context than in Sentence A, and the meaning has shifted to include a new medical concept. Therefore, semantic drift has occurred, and the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the target word ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a condition characterized by complete paralysis of the lower limbs. In this context, the word has a negative connotation, implying a severe loss of mobility and function.

In Sentence B, the target word ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context to describe a patient with multiple porokeratomas on their buttock. In this context, the word has a different connotation, implying a benign and non-progressive condition. The meaning of the word has shifted from a negative connotation to a neutral or even positive one. Therefore, semantic drift has occurred in the meaning of ""paraplegia"" between the two sentences."
11,Paraplegia,"Acute traumatic tear of the thoracic aorta is a severe injury with a high mortality rate. This condition requires expeditious evaluation and prompt surgical intervention in order to improve patient survival. The experience at the authors' institution from 1971 to 1987 includes 41 patients who sustained acute traumatic tear of the thoracic aorta and reached the hospital alive. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the surgical management of this injury with regards to mortality rate and the incidence of spinal cord injury. Five patients died from exsanguination before definitive repair could be undertaken. Thirty-six patients had repair of traumatic aortic tear in the area of the isthmus. Nine patients were operated upon with the clamp and sew technique, 20 patients had a heparin-bonded shunt placed, and seven patients were treated by repair with cardiopulmonary bypass. There were five operative deaths that were not related to the technique employed. Two patients without preoperative evidence of spinal cord injury developed paraparesis. No patient had postoperative paraplegia. Despite rapid transport, expeditious evaluation, and emergency thoracotomy, some patients die from exsanguination prior to definitive repair. Even with the provision of distal aortic perfusion during clamping, the risk of spinal cord injury is not eliminated.","Previous studies to identify risk factors for postoperative deep infection following instrumented spinal fusion surgery for degenerative spinal disease are based on insufficient information and have limited use in clinical practice. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the risk factors and their adjusted relative risks through a comprehensive analysis, including all core information. In this nationwide, population-based, cohort study, data were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database between 1 January 2014, and 31 December 2018. This study included a cohort of 194,036 patients older than 19 years, who underwent instrumented spinal fusion surgery for degenerative spinal disease. We divided this population into cases (patients with postoperative deep infection) and controls (patients without postoperative deep infection); risk factors for postoperative deep infection were determined by multivariable analysis. The definition of postoperative deep infection varied, and sensitivity analyses were performed according to each definition. The estimates of all the statistical models were internally validated using bootstrap samples. The study included 767 patients (0.39%) with postoperative deep spinal infections and 193,269 controls. The final multivariable model identified the following variables as significant risk factors for postoperative deep infection: age between 60-69 years (OR = 1.6 [1.1-2.3]); age between 70-79 years (OR = 1.7 [1.2-2.5]); age > 80 years (OR = 2.1 [1.3-3.2]); male sex (OR = 1.7 [1.5-2.0]); rural residence (OR = 1.3 [1.1-1.5]); anterior cervical approach (OR = 0.2 [0.1-0.3]); posterior cervical approach (OR = 0.5 [0.2-1.0]); multiple approaches (OR = 1.4 [1.2-1.6]); cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.5 [1.2-1.8]); peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.3 [1.1-1.5]); chronic pulmonary disease (OR = 1.2 [1.0-1.4]); rheumatologic disease (OR = 1.6 [1.3-2.1]); liver disease (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.7]); diabetes (OR = 1.5 [1.3-1.7]); hemiplegia or paraplegia (OR = 2.2 [1.5-3.3]); allogenous transfusion (OR = 1.6 [1.3-1.8]); and use of systemic steroids over 2 weeks (OR = 1.5 [1.1-2.0]).

        ###Data to be labelled:
        Target word: Paraplegia
        Sentence A: Acute traumatic tear of the thoracic aorta is a severe injury with a high mortality rate. This condition requires expeditious evaluation and prompt surgical intervention in order to improve patient survival. The experience at the authors' institution from 1971 to 1987 includes 41 patients who sustained acute traumatic tear of the thoracic aorta and reached the hospital alive. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the surgical management of this injury with regards to mortality rate and the incidence of spinal cord injury. Five patients died from exsanguination before definitive repair could be undertaken. Thirty-six patients had repair of traumatic aortic tear in the area of the isthmus. Nine patients were operated upon with the clamp and sew technique, 20 patients had a heparin-bonded shunt placed, and seven patients were treated by repair with cardiopulmonary bypass. There were five operative deaths that were not related to the technique employed. Two patients without preoperative evidence of spinal cord injury developed paraparesis. No patient had postoperative paraplegia. Despite rapid transport, expeditious evaluation, and emergency thoracotomy, some patients die from exsanguination prior to definitive repair. Even with the provision of distal aortic perfusion during clamping, the risk of spinal cord injury is not eliminated.
        Sentence B: Previous studies to identify risk factors for postoperative deep infection following instrumented spinal fusion surgery for degenerative spinal disease are based on insufficient information and have limited use in clinical practice. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the risk factors and their adjusted relative risks through a comprehensive analysis, including all core information. In this nationwide, population-based, cohort study, data were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database between 1 January 2014, and 31 December 2018. This study included a cohort of 194,036 patients older than 19 years, who underwent instrumented spinal fusion surgery for degenerative spinal disease. We divided this population into cases (patients with postoperative deep infection) and controls (patients without postoperative deep infection); risk factors for postoperative deep infection were determined by multivariable analysis. The definition of postoperative deep infection varied, and sensitivity analyses were performed according to each definition. The estimates of all the statistical models were internally validated using bootstrap samples. The study included 767 patients (0.39%) with postoperative deep spinal infections and 193,269 controls. The final multivariable model identified the following variables as significant risk factors for postoperative deep infection: age between 60-69 years (OR = 1.6 [1.1-2.3]); age between 70-79 years (OR = 1.7 [1.2-2.5]); age > 80 years (OR = 2.1 [1.3-3.2]); male sex (OR = 1.7 [1.5-2.0]); rural residence (OR = 1.3 [1.1-1.5]); anterior cervical approach (OR = 0.2 [0.1-0.3]); posterior cervical approach (OR = 0.5 [0.2-1.0]); multiple approaches (OR = 1.4 [1.2-1.6]); cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.5 [1.2-1.8]); peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.3 [1.1-1.5]); chronic pulmonary disease (OR = 1.2 [1.0-1.4]); rheumatologic disease (OR = 1.6 [1.3-2.1]); liver disease (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.7]); diabetes (OR = 1.5 [1.3-1.7]); hemiplegia or paraplegia (OR = 2.2 [1.5-3.3]); allogenous transfusion (OR = 1.6 [1.3-1.8]); and use of systemic steroids over 2 weeks (OR = 1.5 [1.1-2.0]). Our results, which are based on homogenous patient groups, provide clinicians with an acceptable tool for comprehensive risk assessment of postoperative deep infection in patients who will undergo instrumented spinal fusion surgery for degenerative spinal disease.

Reasoning: The meaning of ""paraplegia"" has shifted significantly between the two sentences. In Sentence A, ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific complication of traumatic aortic tear, where five patients developed paraparesis after surgery. In Sentence B, ""paraplegia"" is used more broadly to describe a risk factor for postoperative deep infection in instrumented spinal fusion surgery, with no mention of its relationship to traumatic aortic tear. This shift in meaning suggests that the term ""paraplegia"" has undergone semantic drift."

        Explanation:

The target word ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A (2000) and Sentence B (2020). In Sentence A, ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific type of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by lower-limb spasticity and weakness. In contrast, in Sentence B, ""paraplegia"" is used more broadly to describe the influence of physical activity on the quality of life and functional independence of individuals with spinal cord injury, regardless of the underlying cause of their condition.

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is associated with a specific medical condition, while in Sentence B, it is used as a general term to describe a broader range of conditions related to spinal cord injury. This shift in meaning indicates semantic drift, as the term ""paraplegia"" has taken on a different connotation over time. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate to indicate that the meaning of the target word has significantly shifted between the two sentences."

        1. Changed

        Explanation:

The target word ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe the operative mortality and incidence of paralysis after various surgical procedures. In this context, paraplegia refers to a state of paralysis or weakness in one or more limbs, often resulting from injury or disease.

In Sentence B, the word ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context, referring to genetic diseases that can cause paralysis or weakness. The sentence highlights the genetic mutations identified in unrelated individuals with rare genetic diseases, including paraplegia-related genes. In this context, paraplegia no longer refers to physical paralysis but rather to a genetic condition that can result in paralysis or weakness.

Therefore, the meaning of the target word ""paraplegia"" has changed significantly between the two sentences, indicating semantic drift."

        1. Changed

Reasoning:

In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific medical condition (T-4 ASIA B thoracic paraplegia) and its symptoms (chronic constipation, fecal incontinence, and bowel-related autonomic dysreflexia). The term is used to convey the severity of the condition and the impact it has on the patient's quality of life.

In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context. It is mentioned as a complication of the surgery, specifically in the context of two patients who developed postoperative paraplegia. In this case, the term is used to describe a temporary loss of motor function in the lower half of the body.

Based on these differences in context and meaning, it can be concluded that the term ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe a specific medical condition, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe a temporary complication after surgery. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

We identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in the SPG11 gene in this patient as follows: a mutation in exon 32, c.6194C > G transition (p.S2056X) and a novel c.5121+1C > T splicing mutation. Our finding suggests that these novel compound heterozygous mutations in SPG11 are associated with HSP and lower motor neuron involvement, mild cerebellar signs and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. This study also demonstrates that exome sequencing is an efficient and rapid diagnostic tool for identifying the causes of some complex and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases.

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a condition where a patient has severe back pain due to a metastatic spine disease. The term is used in the context of a medical article discussing the surgical treatment of metastatic lung cancer. In this context, the term ""paraplegia"" likely refers to the physical disability and loss of motor function associated with the spine disease, and may not have any specific connotations or associations with disability or marginalization.

In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context, to describe a genetic disorder characterized by degeneration of the corticospinal tract motor neurons and resulting in progressive lower limb spasticity. In this context, the term ""paraplegia"" likely carries a different meaning and connotation than in Sentence A. Specifically, the term may connote a more severe and degenerative form of disability, and may be associated with a greater sense of urgency and concern for the patient's condition.

Based on these differences in context and meaning, it can be concluded that the term ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning or connotation between the two sentences. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

        Reasoning:
        In Sentence A, ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a neurological disorder affecting peripheral nerves, with a chronic and indolent course. The context suggests that the term has a specific medical meaning related to motor nerve damage.

        In Sentence B, ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context, describing a complication of surgery. The term is now associated with a sudden and potentially reversible loss of motor function, rather than a chronic and indolent neurological disorder. This shift in meaning suggests that the term has undergone semantic drift.

        Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this task."

Reasoning:
In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific type of dog disease, where the dogs suffer from intervertebral disk diseases on cervical and/or thoracolumbar disks. The term is used to describe the severity of the disease, with the dogs experiencing paralysis or weakness in their lower extremities.

In Sentence B, the term ""hereditary spastic paraplegias"" is used to describe a group of genetic disorders that affect the lower extremities and cause spasticity and weakness. The term is used to describe the underlying genetic cause of the disease, rather than the severity of the symptoms.

Therefore, the meaning of the term ""paraplegia"" has changed significantly between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the term is used to describe a specific type of dog disease, while in Sentence B, the term is used to describe a broader group of genetic disorders. As a result, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."

Reasoning: The meaning of ""paraplegia"" has shifted significantly between Sentence A and Sentence B. In Sentence A, ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific medical condition characterized by compression of the spinal cord and resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and weakness in the lower limbs. In contrast, in Sentence B, ""paraplegia"" is used more broadly to describe a range of neurogenetic disorders involving spinocerebellar and pyramidal tracts, including those caused by mutations in the CAPN1 gene. The term is no longer limited to a specific medical condition, but rather encompasses a broader range of neurological disorders. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate for this example."

Reasoning: In Sentence A, the term ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a specific type of spinal cord injury, characterized by a complete or incomplete loss of motor and sensory function in the lower extremities. The sentence highlights the importance of evaluating cardiorespiratory functions in these patients during high-intensity endurance work.

In Sentence B, the term ""paraplegia"" is used in a different context, to describe a complication of spinal tuberculosis, specifically late-onset paraplegia. The sentence emphasizes the importance of surgical correction of severe kyphosis to avoid detrimental effects on both the spinal cord and pulmonary function.

Based on these two sentences, it is clear that the term ""paraplegia"" has undergone a significant change in meaning. In Sentence A, it refers to a specific type of spinal cord injury, while in Sentence B, it is used to describe a complication of a different condition (spinal tuberculosis). Therefore, I would label this task as ""Changed""."
23,Paraplegia,"Spinal cord lesion leads to an interruption of pathways from brain to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, which results in pathological changes in sympathetic innervation. Free epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) were measured in 30 tetraplegics (TETRA), 15 high-lesion paraplegics (T1 and T4, HPARA), 15 paraplegics with injuries between T5 and T10 (MPARA), 15 low-lesion paraplegics (below T10, LPARA) and 16 non-handicapped control persons (C) at rest, at 60 and 100% of maximal oxygen consumption during graded wheelchair ergometry (WCE). The TETRA showed significant lower E and NE levels at rest and only slight increases during physical exercise. The E and NE concentrations of the paraplegics with a lesion below T5 were significantly higher than those of the high-lesion paraplegics, as well as those of the control persons at every point in the study. All paraplegics and the control persons showed, at submaximal and maximal exercise, a significant increase in NE. Only a slight increase in E in HAPRA was shown. No differences were found at rest and during exercise in E and NE levels in the MPARA and LPARA. No significant differences were found in the dopamine concentration at rest or during exercise for any of the groups. In summary, different levels of lesion and the resulting interruption to sympathetic pathways in the spinal cord are decisive factors in the degree of impairment of sympathetic innervation in SCI persons. Tetraplegics show less preganglionic resting activity because of interruption of impulses from central centers and no considerable stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system during maximal exercise. Individuals with high paraplegia have a partial impairment of catecholamine release, especially of epinephrine, at rest and during exercise. Paraplegics with a lesion level below T5 showed an augmented basal and exercise-induced upper spinal thoracic sympathetic activity in comparison to control persons.","Two hypotheses were investigated in the present study: 1) Patients with full posttraumatic stress symptoms following spinal cord injury (SCI) would experience more general health problems than those with partial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with no-PTSD and the control group; 2) Patients with full PTSD would endorse the external locus of control more than those with partial PTSD, no-PTSD and the control group. Sixty-two patients were recruited from a specialized rehabilitation clinic for spinal cord injury. The control group comprised 60 participants without SCI. Patients with SCI were assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC). The control group was assessed using the GHQ-28 and the MHLC. The full PTSD group experienced more somatic problems, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression than the partial PTSD, the no-PTSD and the control groups. The results also showed that the full PTSD group endorsed significantly more external health locus of control than the control group. However, no significant differences were found between the three patient groups in health locus of control. The three PTSD sub-scales were positively correlated with general health problems. Further analyses showed that partial PTSD patients with paraplegia and partial PTSD patients whose SCI had a medically related cause were more likely to report less internal locus of control than other patients. Patients who suffered from full PTSD experienced more general health problems than those with fewer PTSD symptoms and those without SCI. External locus of control was a distinctive strategy that SCI-PTSD patients used in coping with the effects of SCI-PTSD.","###Task: Identify semantic drift in a target word by comparing its usage in two sentences from different time periods.

Free epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) were measured in 30 tetraplegics (TETRA), 15 high-lesion paraplegics (T1 and T4, HPARA), 15 paraplegics with injuries between T5 and T10 (MPARA), 15 low-lesion paraplegics (below T10, LPARA) and 16 non-handicapped control persons (C) at rest, at 60 and 100% of maximal oxygen consumption during graded wheelchair ergometry (WCE). The TETRA showed significant lower E and NE levels at rest and only slight increases during physical exercise. The E and NE concentrations of the paraplegics with a lesion below T5 were significantly higher than those of the high-lesion paraplegics, as well as those of the control persons at every point in the study. All paraplegics and the control persons showed, at submaximal and maximal exercise, a significant increase in NE. Only a slight increase in E in HAPRA was shown. No differences were found at rest and during exercise in E and NE levels in the MPARA and LPARA. No significant differences were found in the dopamine concentration at rest or during exercise for any of the groups. In summary, different levels of lesion and the resulting interruption to sympathetic pathways in the spinal cord are decisive factors in the degree of impairment of sympathetic innervation in SCI persons. Tetraplegics show less preganglionic resting activity because of interruption of impulses from central centers and no considerable stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system during maximal exercise. Individuals with high paraplegia have a partial impairment of catecholamine release, especially of epinephrine, at rest and during exercise. Paraplegics with a lesion level below T5 showed an augmented basal and exercise-induced upper spinal thoracic sympathetic activity in comparison to control persons.
        Sentence B: Two hypotheses were investigated in the present study: 1) Patients with full posttraumatic stress symptoms following spinal cord injury (SCI) would experience more general health problems than those with partial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with no-PTSD and the control group; 2) Patients with full PTSD would endorse the external locus of control more than those with partial PTSD, no-PTSD and the control group. Sixty-two patients were recruited from a specialized rehabilitation clinic for spinal cord injury. The control group comprised 60 participants without SCI. Patients with SCI were assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC). The control group was assessed using the GHQ-28 and the MHLC. The full PTSD group experienced more somatic problems, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression than the partial PTSD, the no-PTSD and the control groups. The results also showed that the full PTSD group endorsed significantly more external health locus of control than the control group. However, no significant differences were found between the three patient groups in health locus of control. The three PTSD sub-scales were positively correlated with general health problems. Further analyses showed that partial PTSD patients with paraplegia and partial PTSD patients whose SCI had a medically related cause were more likely to report less internal locus of control than other patients. Patients who suffered from full PTSD experienced more general health problems than those with fewer PTSD symptoms and those without SCI. External locus of control was a distinctive strategy that SCI-PTSD patients used in coping with the effects of SCI-PTSD.

        ###Answer
        1. Paraplegia: Changed
        
        The meaning of ""paraplegia"" has shifted significantly between Sentence A (2000) and Sentence B (2020). In Sentence A, ""paraplegia"" is used to describe a spinal cord lesion that results in pathological changes in sympathetic innervation. The term implies a disruption in the pathways from the brain to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, leading to impaired sympathetic innervation. In contrast, in Sentence B (2020), ""paraplegia"" is used to describe patients with full or partial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following spinal cord injury (SCI). The term no longer connotes a disruption in the sympathetic nervous system, but rather a psychological response to the trauma of SCI. Therefore, the semantic drift of ""paraplegia"" suggests a shift from a medical to a psychological context."

        ###Answer
        1. Changed

The meaning of the target word ""paraplegia"" has shifted significantly between the two sentences. In Sentence A, the word is used to describe a medical condition where the abdominal aorta is replaced to prevent blood flow disruption to the abdominal organs during surgery. In Sentence B, the word is used to describe a rare manifestation of severe hyperthyroidism, specifically acute polyneuropathy. The word's connotation has shifted from a medical condition related to vascular surgery to a symptom of a hormonal disorder. Therefore, the label ""Changed"" is appropriate."
